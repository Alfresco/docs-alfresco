title: Install into Tomcat zip
---
To install Alfresco Digital Workspace into Tomcat, you first need to install Alfresco Content Services 6.2 or above using the distribution zip. See [Installing using distribution zip LINK](https://docs.alfresco.com/6.2/concepts/ch-install.html) for more information.

1. Log in to the Support Portal at [https://support.alfresco.com](https://support.alfresco.com/).

2. Go to the **Downloads** area and select Alfresco Digital Workspace.

3. Download `digital-workspace.war` for the required version.

4. On the server that will host Alfresco Digital Workspace move the `digital-workspace.war` file to the `<TOMCAT_HOME>/webapps` folder.

   > **Note:** Tomcat extracts the files automatically.

5. Browse the extracted digital-workspace directory and open the `app.config.json` file in a text editor.

6. Edit the `app.config.json` file and change the `ecmHost` property to be the same as your Alfresco Content Services server and allocated port. For example:

    `http://<acsservername>:port`

7. Also in the `app.config.json` file, change the baseShareUrl property to be the same as your Alfresco Digital Workspace server and allocated port. For example:

    `http://<appservername>:port/digital-workspace` (digital-workspace being the name of the war file)

   > **Note:** If Quickshare is disabled in Alfresco Content Services ignore this step.

    To disable Quickshare, set `system.quickshare.enabled=false` in the \tomcat\shared\classes\alfresco-global.properties file. For more information, see [Using the alfresco-global.properties file LINK](https://docs.alfresco.com/6.2/concepts/global-props-intro.html).

8. Save the file.

9. Open your browser and access Alfresco Digital Workspace:

    `http://<appservername>:8080/digital-workspace`
