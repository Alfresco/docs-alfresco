title: Security Controls
---

You can add Security Controls to files and folders so that only users with the required security level can view or access them.
These security controls are created and configured using the Admin App and are applied to your files or folders from within the Digital Workspace.

Security Controls in the Digital Workspace means you create security groups, which in turn are made up of one or more security marks. There are three types of security groups, Hierarchical, All, and Any, and you can create as many Security marks within those groups as you need. 

When you create a new security group in the Admin App there are three Group Types available:

* **All** = Users must have all security marks from the group that are applied to a file to see that file.

    Example: A Security Group named Training contains security marks of Media and Data Handling. To see a file marked as both Media or Data Handling, then a user must have both Media and Data Handling clearance.

* **Any** = Users must have at least one of the security marks from the group that are applied to a file to see that file.

    Example: A Security Group named Nationality contains security marks of UK, US, and Aus. To see a file marked as UK and US, then a user must have UK and / or US clearance.

* **Hierarchical** = Security marks are ranked in the order they're created. The mark created first in a security group has the greatest clearance, the one created last the least clearance.

    Example: The predefined Classification group has marks of Top Secret, Secret, and Classified. To see a file classified as Secret, then the user must have Secret or Top Secret clearance.

It must be done on a folder basis and isnt this done from the Admin App ?

If you're already using Security Marks are they brought over from Governance Services ?
