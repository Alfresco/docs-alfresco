## Print or save a task form

You can print or save to `.pdf` the task forms, including any information entered into the fields.

1. Navigate to the task form you want to print.

2. Click the **Print Form** icon on the top right.

3. Select if you want to print or save as a `.pdf`, and then click **Print** or **Save**.

The output shows the task form, including the name of the task on the top left and the URL of your instance of the Digital Workspace on the top right. The print out saves the entire task form, even if you must scroll to get to the end of it.
