title: Build extensions

The Alfresco Application Development Framework (ADF) extension mechanism allows you to add, remove, and change the behavior of your applications. The extension mechanism supports the Digital Workspace, and is the recommended way to make direct changes to its source code.

Customizations that are implemented through the extension mechanism are more maintainable because the changes are modular and isolated from the core of the application. This approach to customizing the Digital Workspace ensures upgrades are easier to manage and test.

Use the Digital Workspace and develop an extension if your use case is mainly covered by the Digital Workspace functionality. However, some additional changes are required to meet the expectations and the requirements. In case of complex changes, a custom ADF based application is an alternative.

## How to create an extension

Use this information to develop a `hello word` extension for the Digital Workspace.

### Prerequisites

* Alfresco Content Services - Enterprise Edition.
  * Open your browser and check everything starts up correctly:

    ```bash
    http://localhost:8080/alfresco
    ```

* `Node.js` 18.x

* Download the Digital Workspace project from [Nexus](https://nexus.alfresco.com/nexus/#nexus-search;quick~digital%20workspace){:target="_blank"}.

### Create a Digital Workspace extension

Use the [Nx](https://nx.dev/) developer tools for monorepos to create the Digital Workspace extension.

1. Install `nx` cli globally:

    ```bash
    npm install -g nx
    ```

2. Create a new extension called `my-extension` from the root directory of the Digital Workspace project:

    ```bash
    nx g @nrwl/angular:lib my-extension
    ```

    Leave the default values of the command unless you're familiar with what they mean.

    In the `libs/my-extension` path you'll find the following structure:

    * The `src` folder contains all the typescript source code
    * The `index.ts` file defines all the inclusions of the extension
    * The `lib/my-extension.module.ts` file defines the module class for the extension
    * The `README.md` file contains documentation
    * Other files are for testing and configuration

    > **Note:** For more on creating libraries using Nx see [Angular Nx Tutorial - Step 8: Create Libs](https://nx.dev/angular-tutorial/08-create-libs){:target="_blank"}

3. Once `my-extension` is created, add the configuration to the extension module by editing the `./libs/my-extension/src/lib/my-extension.module.ts` file:

    ```java
    // Add the following import to the page.
    import { provideExtensionConfig } from '@alfresco/adf-extensions';
    // Add providers as described below.
    NgModule({
      imports: [CommonModule],
      providers: [
        provideExtensionConfig(['my-extension.json'])
      ]
    })
    export class MyExtensionModule {}
    ```

4. Create a directory called `libs/my-extension/assets`:

    This directory is used to program the extension to add a new item called **hello world** to the **New** button on the landing page of the Digital Workspace.

5. Create a file called `libs/my-extension/assets/my-extension.json` with the following content:

    ```json
    {
      "$version": "1.0.0",
      "$id": "my.extension",
      "$name": "my adf extension",
      "$description": "my adf extension",
      "$license": "Apache-2.0",
      "actions": [],
      "features": {
        "create": [
          {
            "id": "my.extension.hello.world",
            "title": "BYE BYE WORLD! (Logout)",
            "order": 50,
            "actions": {
              "click": "LOGOUT"
            }
          }
        ]
      },
      "routes": [],
      "rules": []
    }
    ```

    > **Note:** After the Digital Workspace extension has been created, ensure the `tsconfig.base.json` file includes a link to the `libs/my-extension/src/index.ts` file as part of the paths item. These are default paths that are set during the creation of the extension. It's useful to verify the paths when troubleshooting.

6. Edit the `apps/content-ee/src/app/extensions.module.ts` file to add the extension module to the application using the following format:

    ```java
    // Add the following import to the page.
    import { MyExtensionModule } from '@alfresco-dbp/my-extension';
    @NgModule({
        imports: [
            ...,
            MyExtensionModule,
        ],
    })
    export class AppExtensionsModule {}
    ```

7. Edit the `angular.json` file by adding the following configuration to the `projects/content-ee/targets/build/options/assets` section:

    This configuration ensures the extension is visible from the Digital Workspace app.

    ```json
    {
      "input": "libs/my-extension/assets",
      "output": "/assets/plugins/",
      "glob": "my-extension.json"
    },
    ```

8. From a command prompt start the Digital Workspace:

    ```shell
    npm start content-ee
    ```

You have now added a new option to the **New** button called **BYE BYE WORLD!**. The new option initiates the logout command from the current Digital Workspace session.

### Replace existing extension

You can replace an existing extension with a new one you have created. To achieve this you must have an existing extension called `my-extension`, and its structure must be compliant with the content and structure of the current `projects/my-extension` file.

1. Run the following command from a command prompt from inside the root folder of the Digital Workspace project:

    ```bash
    nx g @nrwl/angular:lib my-extension
    ```

    > **Note:** Ensure you use the same name as the existing extension, in this example it's called `my-extension`.

Once complete, delete the content of the `libs/my-extension` directory, and replace it with the source code of the new Digital Workspace extension.

## How to add a new page and menu item

You can create a new page and a new menu item in the Digital Workspace. To achieve this you must have a working Digital Workspace extension as well as the full repository. Using the examples above, you should have an extension called `my-extension`.

1. Create a new folder called `libs/my-extension/src/lib/my-first-page`, and add a new file into it called `my-first-page.component.ts` with the following information:

    ```java
    import { Component, } from '@angular/core';
    @Component({
        selector: 'my-first-page',
        template: "<h1>HELLO WORLD!</h1>"
        })
    export class MyFirstPageComponent {}
    ```

2. Edit the `my-extension.json` file in the `libs/my-extension/assets` folder and add the following to the `routes` array:

    ```json
    {
        ...,
        "routes": [
            {
                "id": "my.extension.myFirstPage",
                "path": "my-first-page",
                "parentRoute": "",
                "layout": "app.layout.main",
                "component": "my.extension.components.my-first-page",
                "auth": [
                    "content-services.auth"
                ]
            }
        ],
        "rules": []
    }
    ```

3. Declare the component identifier directly in the extension's module by editing the `libs/my-extension/src/lib/my-extension.module.ts` file with the following:

    ```java
    // Add the following imports.
    import { ExtensionService } from '@alfresco/adf-extensions';
    import { MyFirstPageComponent } from './my-first-page/my-first-page.component';
    // Change the NgModule as follows.
    @NgModule({
      ...,
      declarations: [MyFirstPageComponent]
    })
    export class MyExtensionModule {
      constructor(extensions: ExtensionService) {
        extensions.setComponents({
          'my.extension.components.my-first-page': MyFirstPageComponent,
        });
      }
    }
    ```

    You have added a new route (URI) to the application through the extension. You can test everything is working properly by launching the `npm start content-ee` command and pointing your browser to `http://localhost:4200/#my-first-page`.

4. To add a menu item that points to the new page, edit the `my-extension.json` file in the `libs/my-extension/assets` folder and add the following to the `features` element:

    ```json
    {
      ...
      "features": {
        ...,
        "navbar": [
          {
            "id": "app.navbar.primary",
            "items": [
              {
                "id": "app.navbar.libraries.menu",
                "children": [
                  {
                    "id": "app.navbar.libraries.all-libraries",
                    "title": "My first page",
                    "description": "My first page",
                    "order": 400,
                    "route": "my-first-page",
                    "rules": {
                      "visible": "app.content-services.isEnabled"
                    }
                  }]
              }]
          }]
      },
      ...
    }
    ```
