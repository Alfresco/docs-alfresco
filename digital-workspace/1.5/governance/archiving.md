Alfresco Digital Workspace provides end users with a simple way to archive and retrieve files from Amazon S3 Glacier, a long term, low cost archive store provided by Amazon Web Services.

Archiving and retrieving your files is an important part of information governance. Archiving your files minimizes the cost of storage for infrequently accessed files or you may have a regulatory requirement to archive.

Use the right click menu in Digital Workspace to send your files to be archived. Once archived files are still visible and can also be retrieved using the right click menu.

## Understanding archival icons

These icons appear next to your files and represent their current archival state.

|Archival icon|Description|
|-------------|-----------|

|![restored]({% link digital-workspace/images/restore-from-archive-action.png %})| The amount of time taken to restore your file depends on which retrieval type you selected.|
