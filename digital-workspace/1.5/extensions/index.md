title: Developing extensions to Digital Workspace
---

Alfresco Digital Workspace provides a comprehensive extensibility framework and allows you to customize the Navigation sidebar, Toolbar, Info drawer, Viewer, and Content metadata.

Leveraging a powerful rules engine, developers can control the look and feel of the main areas of the application using pre-built rules or custom rules. For example, removing toolbar buttons based on permissions or group memberships.
