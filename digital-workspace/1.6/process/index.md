Alfresco Digital Workspace has been extended to include Alfresco Process Services functionality for end users.

These features require Alfresco Process Services to be configured with Alfresco Content Services.

If you are an administrator and want to create new processes in Alfresco Process Services for use in Alfresco Digital Workspace see [Create your first process]({% link process-services/latest/using/process/app-designer.md %}#create-your-first-process).
