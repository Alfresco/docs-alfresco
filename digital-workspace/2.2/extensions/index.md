title: Developing extensions to the Digital Workspace
---
Alfresco Digital Workspace provides a comprehensive extensibility framework and allows you to customize the Navigation sidebar, Toolbar, Info drawer, Viewer, and Content metadata.

Leveraging a powerful rules engine, developers can control the look and feel of the main areas of the application using pre-built rules or custom rules. For example, removing toolbar buttons based on permissions or group memberships.

To get access to the source code so you can start developing with the Digital Workspace you need to request a `.zip` file from [Support](https://support.alfresco.com){:target="_blank"}. Currently we do not provide direct code repository access for the Digital Workspace.

Important information about the Digital Workspace 2.1:

* The `README.md` file within the code base `.zip` file contains important project information and guidance.
* We have provided a guide on upgrading the Digital Workspace from version 1.4 or 1.6 to 2.1 which contains important information on changes in the 2.0 version.
* For more in-depth documentation about extending Digital Workspace, see [Extending](https://alfresco-content-app.netlify.com/#/extending/){:target="_blank"}. Also see the `docs/extending.md` file within the source code.
* More documentation has been added to the base Content App project folder, see [About](https://github.com/Alfresco/alfresco-content-app/tree/develop/projects/aca-about){:target="_blank"} and [Settings](https://github.com/Alfresco/alfresco-content-app/tree/develop/projects/aca-settings){:target="_blank"}.
