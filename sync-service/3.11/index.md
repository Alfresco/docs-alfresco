Alfresco Sync Service is an add-on module that synchronizes files between the desktop and repository using web services. It's part of the Desktop Sync solution that consists of three components: Sync Service, Desktop Sync for Windows, and Desktop Sync for Mac. This documentation describes how to install, configure, and administer the Sync Service.

This release of Sync Service is a compatibility release to support Alfresco Content Services 7.4.

Here is a summary of the key capabilities:

* Clustering for scalability support
* Support for various databases: PostgreSQL, Oracle, MySQL, and AWS Aurora MySQL
* Support for AWS deployment
* Events monitoring for content, Governance Services, and permission changes

> **Note:** The Sync Service module can be applied to Alfresco Content Services. See [prerequisites]({% link sync-service/3.11/install/index.md %}) and [Supported platforms]({% link sync-service/3.11/support/index.md %}) for more.
