Sync Service can optionally be deployed as part of Alfresco Content Services using Helm charts or a Docker Compose file.

It is recommended that these deployment references are used as an accelerator by customers who have prior production experience with containerized deployment technologies like Docker, Kubernetes and Helm.

Follow these links to find out how to deploy Alfresco Content Services including the Sync Service using Helm charts or Docker Compose:

* [Deploying Alfresco Content Services with Helm charts on AWS](https://docs.alfresco.com/6.2/tasks/deploy-helm-aws.html){:target="_blank"}(#LINK)
* [Deploying using Docker Compose](https://docs.alfresco.com/6.2/tasks/deploy-docker-compose.html){:target="_blank"}(#LINK)

Due to the limited capabilities of Docker Compose, this deployment method is recommended for development and test environments only.

See the [Alfresco/alfresco-dsync-services-deployment](https://github.com/Alfresco/alfresco-dsync-services-deployment){:target="_blank"} GitHub project documentation for the prerequisites and detailed setup.
