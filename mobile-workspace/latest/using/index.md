title: Using Mobile Workspace
---

## Searching

* You can search globally from all of the main/top level screens which means you can search at any time.
* The Mobile Workspace keeps a recent history of search terms so that previous searches can be quickly repeated.
* Contextual search is available within folders. This search mode will only search within that folder but can be converted to a global search using the quick filter. You can also filter by files and folders within the contextual folder search.
* Search is also available when the device is offline.

## Recent Files

The **Recent Files** view shows all the files that have been created or modified within the last 30 days by the logged in user. The Search API is used to query for changes made by you and includes an extra column to display where the file is located in the content repository.

## Favorites

The **Favorites** view shows all files and folders from the content repository that have been marked as a favorite by the logged in user.

## Offline

**Offline** is a collection of content that is individual to a user and is available when offline. The Mobile Workspace will attempt to keep this collection updated with the latest version wherever possible. You can search files and folders when the device is offline.

## Browse

**Browse** contains the rest of the navigation structure. You can access your libraries, personal files, shared files and discarded files from this screen.

* **Personal Files** retrieves all content from the logged-in user's home area `/User Homes/<username>/` in the repository. If the user is an administrator who does not have a home folder then the repository root folder is shown.

* **File Libraries** retrieves all the sites that the user is a member of, either public, moderated or private. File Libraries is the Libraries component, using the Sites API.

* The **Shared Files** view aggregates all files that have been shared by a logged-in user using the QuickShare feature in the content repository.

* The **Trash** view shows all the items that a user has deleted. An administrator can see items deleted by all users. The actions available in this view are **Restore** and **Permanently Delete**.

## Upload files

You can upload single or multiple files within the Mobile Workspace.

1. Log into the Mobile Workspace.

2. Navigate to the **Personal Files** area.

3. Tap the floating action button (**+**).

4. Tap **Upload Files**.

This will open your file repository on your mobile device (for example, Files for iPhone users) where you can select files to upload. This will upload files to the Personal files area. If you want to upload to a specific folder, create a new folder first and upload from inside that folder.

To upload photos, you can use the following options:

 | Option | Description |
 | -------- | ----------- |
 | **Upload photos and videos** | Photos are automatically uploaded without EXIF metadata according to the device security system. |
 | **Upload files** | Photos are uploaded with EXIF metadata. |

## Share files from another file system

You can share single or multiple files from a different file system with the Mobile Workspace.

1. On your mobile device, select the files you want to share with the Mobile Workspace. For example, in Google Drive.

2. Use the share function within the different file system (for example, 'Send a Copy' with Google Drive) and select Workspace.

3. Select the location in the Mobile Workspace to share and store your files, and then tap **Upload**.

This will upload files to the Personal files area. If you want to upload to a specific folder, create a new folder first and then upload from inside that folder. Files can also be shared this way using the gallery with the Mobile Workspace.

Open the Mobile Workspace to view your files.

> **Note:** When uploading photos using this option, EXIF metadata is not preserved. To preserve the EXIF metadata, upload photos using the **Upload files** option. For more information, see [Upload files](#upload-files).

* On the Recent Files view, a banner displays the sync progress for all files as a percentage complete. Tapping the sync status banner opens a Transfers view with all the files selected to be shared with the Mobile Workspace.
* On the Transfers view, tap the **Sync All** button to force the files to upload. This is used to complete the transfer when files were shared without an internet connection or if the internet connection is lost.

## Tasks

You can view, filter, complete, and add comments to tasks while logged into the Mobile Workspace.

### Tasks Overview

The **Tasks** button is located at the bottom between **Favorites** and **Offline**. The Tasks list loads active tasks assigned to you or created by you. Task priority colors are set as the following: Low (green), Medium (orange), and High (red). Tasks will refresh when you scroll down to the end of the task list or when you tap the refresh button. The refresh button will also reset filters.

* A Dark mode for Tasks can be set within user Settings under Appearance.
* If you are unable to view tasks, you will see this error: **This account is not configured on the process services.**

### Task Filters

Filters can be set for Status, Due date, and Task Name. Filter chips are shown at the top of the Task list and will show the active filter.

1. Select a filter chip.

2. Follow the directions for each filter as follows:

    * A Status filter can be set by selecting **Active** or **Completed** and then select **Apply**. The Status filter chip label will show the active filter, so “Completed” instead of “Status”.
    * Select **Due date** to set a custom, date-ranged filter. **From** and **To** start and end fields are set using a calendar date picker. Only one date needs to be set.
    * Select **Task Name** to filter tasks by name. Enter your search in a text field. This filter does not apply to priority and is not case sensitive.

3. Select **Apply** to set the filter and **Reset** to reset the filter to default. The **X** in the top right closes the window and returns you to the Task list.

## Workflow Management

You can create and manage workflows within the Mobile Workspace. Workflows allow you to expand on the functionality provided by tasks by assigning a set of parameters to them. You can attach files to an existing workflow or create a new one using a file that has been added previously. Workflows can be assigned to an individual user or a group of users. 

You can access workflows in two ways by either creating a workflow from the context menu of an existing file, or using the **Tasks** menu to set up the workflow. The **Tasks** section is divided into two parts: **Tasks** and **Workflows**.

To set up a workflow, you can either:

* Create a new workflow from the context menu of an existing file.
* Starting from the **Workflows** tab, tap the floating action button (**+**), and then select a workflow.

## Manage Forms

You can manage a wide variety of forms directly from your mobile device. All standard form components are available in the Mobile Workspace, allowing you to complete a task by filling out forms tailored to your specific use case.   
 
Forms in the Mobile Workspace are integrated into tasks within a workflow process. This enables you to enter, validate, and edit data, attach files, provide consent, and assign tasks to users seamlessly. 

You can also distribute tasks among groups, allowing any member of the group to claim and work on a task.

### Form Components

The following components are included in the default form:

* Text 
* Multi-line text 
* Number 
* Checkbox 
* Date 
* Date and time 
* Dropdown 
* Amount 
* Radio Buttons 
* People 
* Group of People 
* Hyperlink 
* Attach File 
* Attach Folder 
* Display value 
* Display text 

### Workflow with Task

The workflow process manages the completion of all tasks in a specific sequence. You can view and filter workflow processes, start new ones, or track ongoing processes. The workflow process is complete when all associated tasks are finished.

> **Note:** A workflow with a single task is completed once this task is finished.
