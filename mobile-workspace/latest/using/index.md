title: Using Mobile Workspace
---

## Searching

* You can search globally from all of the main/top level screens which means you can search at any time.
* The Mobile Workspace keeps a recent history of search terms so that previous searches can be quickly repeated.
* Contextual search is available within folders. This search mode will only search within that folder but can be converted to a global search using the quick filter. You can also filter by files and folders within the contextual folder search.

## Recent Files

The **Recent Files** view shows all the files that have been created or modified within the last 30 days by the logged in user. The Search API is used to query for changes made by you and includes an extra column to display where the file is located in the content repository.

## Favorites

The **Favorites** view shows all files and folders from the content repository that have been marked as a favorite by the logged in user.

## Offline

**Offline** is a collection of content that is individual to a user and is available when offline.
The Mobile Workspace will attempt to keep this collection updated with the latest version wherever possible.

## Browse

**Browse** contains the rest of the navigation structure. You can access your libraries, personal files, shared files and discarded files from this screen.

* **Personal Files** retrieves all content from the logged in user's home area `/User Homes/<username>/` in the repository. If the user is an administrator who does not have a home folder then the repository root folder is shown.

* **File Libraries** retrieves all the sites that the user is a member of, either public, moderated or private. File Libraries is the Libraries component, using the Sites API.

* The **Shared Files** view aggregates all files that have been shared using the QuickShare feature in the content repository.

* The **Trash** view shows all the items that a user has deleted. An administrator can see items deleted by all users. The actions available in this view are **Restore** and **Permanently Delete**.

## Upload files

You can upload single or multiple files within the Mobile Workspace.

1. Log into the Mobile Workspace.

2. Navigate to the **Personal Files** area.

3. Press the plus **+** button.

4. Press **Upload Files**.

This will open your file repository on your mobile device (e.g. Files for iPhone users) where you can select files to upload. This will upload files to the Personal files area. If you want to upload to a specific folder, create a new folder first and upload from inside that folder.

## Share files from another file system

You can share single or multiple files from a different file system with the Mobile Workspace.

1. On your mobile device, select the files you want to share with the Mobile Workspace. For example, in Google Drive.
    

2. Use the share function within the different file system (e.g. 'Send a Copy' with Google Drive) and select Workspace.

3. Select the location in the Mobile Workspace to share and store your files, and then click **Upload**.

This will upload files to the Personal files area. If you want to upload to a specific folder, create a new folder first and then upload from inside that folder. Files can also be shared this way using the gallery with the Mobile Workspace.
    
Open the Mobile Workspace to view your files.
 
 * On the Recent Files view, a banner displays the sync progress for all files as a percentage complete. Pressing the sync status banner opens a Transfers view with all the files selected to be shared with the Mobile Workspace. 
 * On the Transfers view, use the **Sync All** button to force the files to upload. This is used to complete the transfer when files were shared without an internet connection or if the internet connection is lost.
