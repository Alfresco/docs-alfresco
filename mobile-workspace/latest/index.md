Alfresco Mobile Workspace offers a seamless experience across multiple platforms, enabling you to work efficiently away from your workstation without losing access to your content. It makes it possible to view and search content even without an internet connection.

You can access your libraries, view recent and shared files, and manage your favorites directly from your mobile device. You can view major document types, such as Microsoft Word, Excel, and PowerPoint, in large previews for an optimal viewing experience. You can scan physical documents directly to servers and view or upload images and videos, including formats like `JPEG` and `PNG`. You can select between a light or dark mode interface, depending on your preference.

Alfresco Mobile Workspace streamlines your task management. You can view, create and edit tasks, including adding comments, accessing details, and completing tasks. You can also attach files, such as  photos, videos, or documents, to your tasks, as well as delete unnecessary files. 

You can complete tasks within a workflow by filling out forms tailored to your specific use case. All standard form components are available to you in the Alfresco Mobile Workspace.

Alfresco Mobile Workspace also facilitates the sharing of single or multiple files from different file systems, like Google Drive. The Mobile Workspace is now integrated into the share options of other application.
