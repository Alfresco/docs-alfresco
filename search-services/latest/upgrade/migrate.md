title: Migrate Solr 4 to Solr 6 
---

Use this information to migrate from Alfresco One 5.1 with the Solr 4 search index server to Alfresco Content Services 6.2 with the Solr 6 search index server.

To determine the current search server, navigate to the Search Manager page at **Alfresco Share Admin Console > Repository Services > Search Service**. Select the search subsystem from the **Search Service In Use** list.

> **Note:** The Admin Console is only available for users who are using Alfresco Content Services Enterprise.

Follow the steps to migrate from Alfresco One 5.x with Solr 4 search service to Alfresco Content Services 6.2 with Solr 6 search service.

1. Upgrades from Alfresco One 5.0 or 5.1 need to first stop at 5.2 to upgrade search to Alfresco Search Services, and then upgrade to 6.0.

2. Upgrades from Alfresco Content Services 5.2 must first upgrade to Search Services from Solr 4, and then upgrade to 6.0

3. Make sure you upgrade to Alfresco Search Services 2.0 before upgrading the repository to 6.2.

4. Install and configure Solr 6 to track the repository. For more information, see [Installation options]({% link search-services/latest/install/options.md %})

5. While Solr 6 builds its indexes, you can monitor progress using the `SUMMARY` report.

```http
http://localhost:8080/solr/admin/cores?action=SUMMARY&wt=xml 
```

For details, see the [Monitor and troubleshoot]({% link search-services/latest/admin/monitor.md %}#unindexed-transactions) topic.

6. Optionally, you can use the Solr Admin Web interface to view Solr configuration details, run queries, and analyze document fields.

    1. Open the FireFox **Certificate Manager** by selecting **Firefox > Preferences > Advanced > Certificates > View Certificates > Your Certificates**.

    2. Import the browser keystore `browser.p12` that is located in your `<ALFRESCO_HOME>/alf_data/keystore directory`.

    3. Enter the password `alfresco`.

        A window displays showing that the keystore has been imported successfully. The **Certificate Manager** now contains the imported keystore with the Alfresco repository certificate under the **Your Certificates** tab.

    4. Close the **Certificate Manager** by clicking **OK**.

    5. In the browser, navigate to a Solr URL.

        For example, use `http://localhost:8080/solr`.

        The browser displays an error message window to indicate that the connection is untrusted. This is due to the Alfresco certificate not being tied to the server IP address. In this case, view the certificate and confirm that it is signed by the Alfresco Certificate Authority.

    6. Expand **I understand the risks**.

    7. Select **Add Exception**.

    8. Click **View**.

        This displays the certificate.

    9. Confirm that the certificate was issued by Alfresco Certificate Authority, and then confirm the **Security Exception**.

    Access to Solr 6 is granted. The Solr Admin page is displayed. It is divided into two parts.

    The left-side of the screen is a menu under the Solr logo that provides navigation through various screens. The first set of links are for system-level information and configuration and provide access to Logging, Core Admin and Java Properties. At the end of this information is a list of Solr cores configured for this instance of Alfresco.

    The center of the screen shows the detail of the Solr core selected, such as statistics, summary report, and so on.

7. When the index is updated as reported by the `SUMMARY` report, you can use the `REPORT` option and check the following:

* In the `REPORT` option, node count should match the number of live nodes in the repository (assuming nothing is changing and the index is updated). The index contains a document for failed nodes, so failures need to be considered separately.
* Any missing transactions; if there are issues, use the `FIX` option.

```http
http://localhost:8080/solr/admin/cores?action=FIX
```

For more information, see the [Monitor and troubleshoot]({% link search-services/latest/admin/monitor.md %}) topic.

Find errors with specific nodes using `DOC_TYPE:ErrorNode` option.

```http
https://localhost:8446/solr/alfresco/afts?q=DOC_TYPE:ErrorNode 
```

If there are any issues, use the `REINDEX` option with the relevant node id.

```http
http://localhost:8080/solr/admin/cores?action=REINDEX&txid=1&acltxid=2&nodeid=3&aclid=4
```

For more information, see the [Monitor and troubleshoot]({% link search-services/latest/admin/monitor.md %}) topic.
