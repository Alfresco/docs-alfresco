title: Alfresco Search Services 
---

Use this information to configure and manage Alfresco Search Services 2.0 for Alfresco Content Services. Alfresco Content Services uses Search Services with Solr 6 as the default search service index, providing an improved and efficient search functionality.

The Alfresco Content Services subscription grants the right to deploy Alfresco Search Services onto the same server as the Alfresco Content Services deployment. A separate Alfresco Search and Insight Engine subscription is required to deploy Search Services and Insight capability to separate server(s), to alleviate load or implement sharding. For more see [Alfresco Search and Insight Engine]({% link insight-engine/latest/index.md %}).

> **Note:** In this information, the Solr 6 search subsystem is referred to as Solr.

> **Important:** The Lucene search subsystem is not supported in Alfresco Content Services.
