title: SOLR Admin REST API
---
In addition to default SOLR Core Admin API actions, Alfresco SOLR provides several actions that can be executed via HTTP requests that specify an action parameter, with additional action specific arguments provided as additional parameters.

The Base URL for every action is:

```http
http://localhost:8983/solr/admin/cores?action=<action>
```

> **Note:** `<action>` is the name of the action to be invoked.

By default, responses are expressed in XML but if you add the URL parameter `wt=json` the response will be in JSON.

Every action response includes a `responseHeader` with the execution time and the status of the request.

```json
{
    "responseHeader": {
      "QTime": 1,
      "status": 0
  }
}
```

> **Note:** When the status is `0`, the request has been executed successfully. You do need to review all additional nodes in the response to check they also executed successfully. When the status isn't `0`, the server logs contain an internal error raised by the request.

## Synchronous Actions

The execution of the action is performed as part of the request handling. An `action.status` value is included in the response that indicates if the action has been performed successfully or not. If the action fails, an additional `errorMessage` value is included in the response.

Generic `success` response:

```json
{
  "responseHeader": {
    "QTime": 1,
    "status": 0
  },
  "action": {
    "status": "success"
  }
}
```

Generic `error` response:

```json
{
   "responseHeader": {
      "QTime": 1,
      "status": 0
  },
  "action": {
    "errorMessage": "Core alfresco has NOT been created as storeRef param is required",
    "status": "error"
  }
}
```

```http
http://localhost:8983/solr/admin/cores?action=fix
```

> **Note:** If indexing has previously been disabled the `dryRun` parameter will be forced to be true which will result in no work being scheduled.

The optional URL parameters that can be added:

* **`core`**

    The name of the core to be fixed.

* **`dryRun`**

    This optional parameter when set to true generates a health report but reindex work is not scheduled. When set to false reindex work is scheduled. The default value is `true`.

}
```

The **`report`** action compares the database with the index and generates an overall status report with the following details:

* DB transaction count: the transaction count on the database.
* DB acl transaction count: the ACL transaction count on the database.
* Count of duplicated transactions in the index: the number of transactions that appear more than once in the index. The value of this property should be zero. If it isn't zero there is an issue with the index.
* Count of duplicated acl transactions in the index: the number of ACL transactions that appear more than once in the index. The value of this property should be zero. If it isn't zero there is an issue with the index.
* Count of transactions in the index but not the database: the number of transactions in the index but not in the database. This count includes empty transactions that have been purged from the database. The value of this property should be zero. If it isn't zero there is an issue with the index.
* Count of acl transactions in the index but not the DB: the number of ACL transactions in the index but not in the database. The value of this property should be zero. If it isn't zero there is an issue with the index.

    > **Note:** Empty ACL transactions are not purged from the database.

* Count of missing transactions from the Index: the number of transactions in the database but not in the index. The value of this index should be zero when the index is up-to-date.
* Count of missing acl transactions from the Index: the number of ACL transactions in the database but not in the index. The value of this property should be zero when the index is up-to-date.
* Index transaction count: the number of transactions in the index.
* Index acl transaction count: the number of ACL transactions in the index.
* Index unique transaction count: the number of unique transactions in the index.
* Index unique acl transaction count: the number of unique ACL transactions in the index.
* Index leaf count: the number of docs and folders in the index.
* Count of duplicate leaves in the index: the number of duplicate docs or folders in the index. The value of this property should be zero. If it isn't zero there is an issue with the index.
* Last index commit time: the time stamp for the last transaction added to the index. It also indicates that transactions after this time stamp have not yet been indexed.
* Last Index commit date: the time stamp set as a date for the last transaction added to the index. It also indicates that transactions after this date have not yet been indexed.
* Last TX id before holes: indicates that transactions after this ID will be checked again to make sure they have not been missed. This is computed from the index at start up time. By default, it is set an hour after the last commit time found in the index. Solr tracking, by default, goes back an hour from the current time to check that no transactions have been missed.
* First duplicate: indicates if there are duplicate transactions in the index. It returns the ID of the first duplicate transaction.
* First duplicate acl tx: indicates if there are duplicate ACL transactions in the index. It returns the ID of the first duplicate ACL transaction.
* First transaction in the index but not the DB: if the related count is > 0, it returns the ID of the first offender.
* First acl transaction in the index but not the DB: if the related count is > 0, it returns the ID of the first offender.
* First transaction missing from the Index: if the related count is > 0, it returns the ID of the first offender.
* irst acl transaction missing from the Index: if the related count is > 0, it returns the ID of the first offender.
* First duplicate leaf in the index: if the related count is > 0, it returns the ID of the first offender.

### `summary`

Get a detailed report for a core for every core including information related to handlers and trackers.

```http
http://localhost:8983/solr/admin/cores?action=summary&core=(coreName)
```

Optional URL parameters can be added:

* **`detail`**

    When true provides statistics per tracking thread.

* **`hist`**

    When true provides a histogram of the times taken for tracking operations for each tracking thread.

* **`values`**

    When true adds reports for the last 50 values recorded for each tracking operation for each thread.

    > **Note:** This parameter is boolean and when false returns 0 values for each tracking operation for each thread.

* **`reset`**

    When true resets all tracking statistics.

The `summary` action provides the status of the tracking index and reports the progress of each tracking thread and generates a report with the following details:

* Active: the tracker for the core active.
* Last Index Commit Time: the time stamp for the last transaction that was indexed.
* Last Index Commit Date: indicates the time stamp as a date for the last transaction that was indexed.

    > **Note:** Changes made after this time are not yet in the index.

* Lag: the difference in seconds between the last transaction time stamp on the server and the time stamp for the last transaction that was indexed.
* Duration: the time lag as an XML duration.
* Approx transactions remaining: the approximate number of transactions to index in order to bring the index up-to-date. It is calculated by using the last transaction ID on the server minus the last transaction ID indexed. It includes all the missing and empty transactions.
* Approx transaction indexing time remaining: it is based on approx transactions remaining, the average number of nodes per transaction and the average time to index a node (how long the index will take to be up-to-date). The estimate is seconds, minutes, hours and days.
* Model sync times (ms): summary statistics for the model sync time. It supports additional information with &detail=true, &hist=true and &value=true.
* Acl index time (ms): summary statistics for ACL index time. It supports additional information with &detail=true, &hist=true and &value=true.
* Node index time (ms): summary statistics for node index time. It supports additional information with &detail=true, &hist=true and &value=true.
* Acl tx index time (ms): summary statistics for ACL transaction index time. It supports additional information with &detail=true, &hist=true and &value=true.
* Tx index time (ms): summary statistics for transaction index time. It specifies the estimated time required to bring the index up-to-date.
* Docs/Tx: summary statistics for the number of documents per transaction. It supports additional information with &detail=true, &hist=true and &value=true.
* Doc Transformation time (ms): summary statistics for document transformation time. It supports additional information with &detail=true, &hist=true and &value=true.
