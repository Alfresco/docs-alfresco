title: Support Holiday Calendar
---

Below is a list of observed holidays for each of the Support Centers. Each region's Support Center assists customers during the customer's local business hours from 8AM-6PM (0800-1800). Each Alfresco Support Center is always open 24*7 for all Severity One â€“ Production Down concerns.

The following holidays are observed with reduced staffing at the Support Centers. Reduced staffing indicates that the Support Center is open to assist customers with a reduced support staff. All Production System Down issues are always addressed, while all other questions/issues are handled as soon as possible.

Regardless of a Support Center being closed or in a reduced staff mode, Premier and Enterprise customers continue to get support for any Severity One - Production System Down issue 24*7.
