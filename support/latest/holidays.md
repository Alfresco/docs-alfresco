title: Support Holiday Calendar
---

There is a list of observed holidays for each of the Support Centers. Each region's Support Center assists customers during the customer's local business hours from 8AM-6PM (0800-1800). Regardless of a Support Center being closed or in a reduced staff mode, customers continue to get support for any Production System Down issue 24*7.

The holidays are observed with reduced staffing at the Support Centers. Reduced staffing indicates that the Support Center is open to assist customers with a reduced support staff. All Production System Down issues are always addressed, while all other questions/issues are handled as soon as possible.
