## Premier Services Policy

Clarifications to the policies associated with the Premier Services personnel.

### Technical Account Managers (TAM)

During times of absence, accounts are temporarily reassigned to another TAM for handling Severity Level 1 support cases.

### Premier Services Engineers (PSEs)

PSEs (remote or on-site) work normal Hyland business hours for the time zone in which they are based. The PSE is assigned full time to one named customer account. PSEs adhere to the published holiday calendar. PSEs may take reasonable time off as needed for illness, vacation, training, and other internal company needs. During these periods, Hyland will meet our support obligations using the normal Hyland support channels, including Community and phone access for high severity level issues. Other parts of the Premier Services program remain in force. For periods of extended absence greater than four weeks, Hyland provisions a backup resource and coordinates a hand-off. Due to geographic constraints, backup personnel may be located at a remote location.
