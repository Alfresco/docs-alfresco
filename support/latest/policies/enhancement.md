title: Enhancement Policy
---

Alfresco accepts code contributions, improvements, suggestions, and recommendations for future releases. The Enhancement policy manages these items.

## What is an enhancement request

An enhancement request is a piece of functionality that was not specified at the time that the code was written, or an extension to what is already present. Undocumented functionality is considered an enhancement request.

## How are enhancement requests created

Enhancement requests are created by customers and partners through the **Feedback** page on Hyland Community. Feedback in Hyland Community is designed to facilitate innovation around Hyland products and solutions. Think of it as your connection to our Product Management team, your opportunity to influence the roadmap and to submit overall feedback. You can suggest product enhancements, and share a concept for something new. Please visit the [Community Feedback Portal Guide](https://community.hyland.com/en/help/documentation/reference-guide/Feedback){:target="_blank"} for more information.

## What happens to my enhancement requests

Enhancement requests are kept in a separate Engineering [project](https://issues.alfresco.com/jira/browse/MNT){:target="_blank"}.

As the planning for a new release gets underway, enhancements requests are reviewed for consideration in the next release.

Once an enhancement request has been implemented, the original enhancement request is closed and the requester is notified.

## Can enhancement requests be escalated

If you are a customer or partner, then you can escalate your enhancement via the standard Customer Success and account management channels.

## Can I request an enhancement for a specific Alfresco product/version

Yes, if your product or version is in "Full Support" state. Please refer to the [Product Support Policy]({% link support/latest/policies/index.md %}) section for more details.
