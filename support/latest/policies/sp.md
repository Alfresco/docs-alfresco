title: Service Pack Escalation Policy
---

In general, customer and partner issues are given priority over any community issues. These issues are addressed within the next Service Pack release possible based on complexity and prioritization.

Customers and partners may request that an issue be escalated into the next Service Pack. The Customer Care Advocate team handles all requests to ensure the Alfresco Product Management and Alfresco Engineering are aware of the escalation.
