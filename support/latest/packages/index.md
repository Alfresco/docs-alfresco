## Premier Program Services

This offering is the most appropriate if you need Alfresco to know you, your environment, and your Alfresco Content Services and/or Alfresco Process Services solution.  All support cases submitted are given the highest priority and have the shortest targeted response times.

This Service is for you if you:

* Have a large project
* Want a designated Alfresco Technical staff member to be part of your team
* Need help managing your issues
* Would like a preview of the product road map
* Require Best Practice advice
* Need someone who knows your technical environment and is able to offer proactive support geared specifically to your needs
* Require a designated technical contact

* Need scalability testing
* Desire a specific Alfresco Product Training for your staff

The Alfresco Service Engineer Program provides large enterprise customers with an Alfresco Service Engineer dedicated to the planning, deployment, and day-to-day maintenance of your Alfresco product solution. This resource serves as the primary point of contact for all technical issues and requests, optimizes the Alfresco solution to meet demanding user requirements and helps content managers plan for future growth. With this program, your dedicated Alfresco Service Engineer works 40 hours per week for you, either physically on-site at your office (On-site Services Engineer—OSE) or remotely from ours Remote Services Engineer—RSE).

The Alfresco Technical Account Management Program provides customers with a highly skilled, proactive Technical Account Manager (TAM) who acts as a single point of contact into the Alfresco global support organization. This resource is assigned to you, has a detailed knowledge of your work environment and business needs, and acts as your advocate, ensuring that support issues and technical requests are addressed and resolved quickly.

## Enterprise Support

Ideal for high-availability systems, Enterprise Support offers fast response times. Any production system down issue (Severity 1) is responded to on a 24*7 basis. Our on-call engineers work with your team to address the issue in the shortest possible time. Any other severity issues are initially responded to within the targeted service level response time; see the Target Service Level Target section.

## Starter/Business Support

With telephone access and Support Portal access, all severity issues are initially responded to within the targeted service level response time; see the Target Service Level Target section. Starter/Business Support is most appropriate for small non-mission critical applications.

## Developer Support

Developer Support is a support offering delivered remotely by a dedicated team of development-focused, senior Support Engineers. This support offering is best for customers and partners that require on-going support for their development teams and customized code.

Unlimited cases can be raised via the Customer Support Portal and will be managed through a separate Development Support Queue, with a 1-business day SLT for initial response. At this time, there is no SLT offered for case resolution.

## Alfresco Partner Support

If you need local language support, you may like to consider working with one of the Alfresco Support Partners.

Alfresco Support Partners can help you with planning your solution, through implementation, transfer of knowledge, and, of course, full support under one of the aforementioned Alfresco packages.
