title: Support Issue Resources and Case Logging
---

The [Support Portal](https://support.alfresco.com){:target="_blank"} has a variety of self-service tools. You can also log a support case in this portal.

The self-service tools are as follows:

* Solutions (Knowledge Base)

    Solutions is a knowledge base that is constantly growing, so we recommended that you search for solutions to common issues before logging a support case.

    To access the knowledge base, log in to the [Support Portal](https://support.alfresco.com){:target="_blank"} and then go to **Solutions** tab to search for a topic.

* Alfresco Documentation

    The officially supported [Alfresco Documentation](https://docs.alfresco.com/) has all the current information on installing, configuring, using, administering, customizing, extending, and troubleshooting for your major version of Alfresco products.

Should you not find your answer using the self-service tools, please log a support case using one of the following methods:

* Support Portal

    Alfresco Support has a web interface that you can use to log a support case. Go to [Support Portal](https://support.alfresco.com){:target="_blank"} and create a new case with the pertinent details and any necessary attachments.

    In the event that the Support Portal is down or unavailable, then support contacts can email [support@alfresco.com](mailto:support@alfresco.com) which will automatically create a support issue.

* Telephone - mandatory logging method for Severity 1 issues

    For all issues, we recommend logging a support case first so that we are looking at the same information you have in real-time.

    If you'd prefer to talk to us, you can find our phone numbers on the Support Portal ([Support Portal](https://support.alfresco.com){:target="_blank"}). Click **Contact us** and use the support number closest to your geographic location and time zone.
