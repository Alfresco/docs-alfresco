title: Support Issue Resources and Case Logging
---

[Hyland Community](https://community.hyland.com){:target="_blank"} has a variety of self-service tools. You can also log a support case in this portal.

The self-service tools are as follows:

* Knowledge Base

    Our knowledge base is constantly growing, so we recommended that you search for solutions to common issues before logging a support case.

    To access the knowledge base, log in [Hyland Community](https://community.hyland.com){:target="_blank"} and then go to **Support --> Knowledgebase** to search for a topic.

* Alfresco Documentation

    The officially supported [Alfresco Documentation](https://docs.alfresco.com) has all the current information on installing, configuring, using, administering, customizing, extending, and troubleshooting for your major version of Alfresco products.

Should you not find your answer using the self-service tools, please log a support case using one of the following methods:

* Hyland Community

    Hyland Community has a web interface that you can use to log a support case. Go to [Support Cases](https://community.hyland.com/customer-portal/support-cases){:target="_blank"} on Hyland Community and create a new case with the pertinent details.

* Telephone - For **production system or process down emergencies** where your solution or essential processes are not available, please contact us by phone, contact information is available on Hyland Community [here](https://community.hyland.com/customer-portal/wiki/hyland-support/technical-support-phone-numbers){target="_blank"}.

    For all issues, we recommend logging a support case.
