title: Contact Hyland Support
---

There are several ways to contact Hyland for assistance with your products and solutions. Hyland Support assistance descriptions follow; however, if you are experiencing an issue and are not sure who to contact, please submit a case via [Community](https://community.hyland.com/){:target="_blank"} and Support will assist in connecting you with the right resource.

## Support Analysts

Support Analysts answer questions concerning customer environments and troubleshoot issues with implemented solutions:

* Specific functionality (“How should this button work?”)
* Broken functionality (”I pressed this button and X should have happened, but I saw Y”)
* Broken public API calls

Active maintenance and support is required.

To contact Support, please log into [Community](https://community.hyland.com/){:target="_blank"} and navigate to **Support > Open Support Cases**. From this page you can submit a new support case, review the status of an existing support case, and comment on an open case to share information with the assigned Analyst.

Production down and emergency support issues should be reported to Support by phone and are prioritized by the scope of impact. Phone contact information is located on the Community Contact Support page.

## Global Services Consultants

Consultants help you to:

* Install, upgrade, and configure Alfresco product solutions in customer environments
* Build applications on top of Alfresco products
* Design and architect your Alfresco Digital Business Platform project
* Incorporate best practice advice
* Help identify issues that are intertwined with custom code before handing off to Support

Consultants work on a per day basis and their services must be purchased separately from maintenance and support. Partner consultants are arranged and billed through the Partner. You can arrange consulting hours through your normal sales channel. For additional information, please contact your Hyland Account Executive for direction.

## Partner Enablement Team

The Partner Enablement Team helps Partners with their specific environment, general and pre-sales related questions. More information is available at [Partner Central](https://partners.alfresco.com/English/){:target="_blank"} or by contacting [partner-feedback@alfresco.com](mailto:partner-feedback@alfresco.com).

## Support contacts - **MOVED***

When your support contract was activated, we asked for the names and details of support contacts who would log all your support cases.

Within the Support Portal, there is a **Contact Management** tab and feature where support contacts can be enabled/disabled.

If you would like to enable your allowed support contacts, please have your Primary Technical Support contact access the Support Portal and use the enable self service feature under the **Contact Management** tab.

If any contacts need to be updated and cannot access the Support Portal themselves, please have an existing support contact log a support case with the change request detailing the name, email address, and telephone number of the person/s requiring access. If there are no longer any enabled support contacts available to perform this task, please email [support@alfresco.com](mailto:support@alfresco.com) directly to let us know.
