title: Support Case Life Cycle
---

You have contacted Technical Support using [Hyland Community](https://community.hyland.com/){:target="_blank"} or by telephone for a production down issue. So, what happens next?

Your support case is intelligently routed to an available and knowledgeable Support Analyst within Technical Support that can address the issue you're experiencing based on the issue summary and description provided when the case was created. The Analyst assigned will follow up to understand the impact the issue is having on your business, and to make sure they have the information needed to effectively troubleshoot the issue.

Depending on the complexity of the issue being experienced, the Support Analyst will follow up with you in various ways:

* If a resolution is quickly identifiable, the Analyst will update the case and assist you to implement the resolution.
* If they cannot resolve the issue quickly, or replicate the issue for further troubleshooting, the Analyst may request your assistance to gather additional information until they are able to replicate or have resolved the issue.
* If we identify the issue as a product defect, it is logged with Development and the Analyst assists them to prioritize the issue based on its business impact, with the items having the greatest impact to the customer base taking on the highest priority.

Good communication is essential for us to focus on your issue. For Technical Support to address your issue we may request additional information. A timely response is appreciated, as it will assist us in resolving your issue that much faster.

If at any point you are not satisfied with the progress being made toward case resolution, you can escalate your case by contacting Hyland's Customer Care Advocate (CCA) team via **Engage Customer Care** on Hyland Community.

A support case is closed and **Resolved** upon your sign off on the resolution. If the reported issue has not been seen before, the issue and resolution will be documented in our [Knowledge Base](https://community.hyland.com/tskb){:target="_blank"} to assist other customers who may encounter the same issue.

As the last step in the support case life cycle, when your case is closed you are sent a short survey designed to help us improve our service. Your feedback is important to us, and taking a couple of minutes to tell us how we did resolving your issue is greatly appreciated.
