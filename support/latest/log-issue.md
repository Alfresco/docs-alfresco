title: Support Issue Resources and Case Logging
---

The [Hyland Community](https://community.hyland.com){:target="_blank"} has a variety of self-service tools. You can also log a support case in this portal.

The self-service tools are as follows:

* Knowledge Base

    The [knowledge base](https://community.hyland.com/tskb){:target="_blank"} is constantly growing, so we recommended that you search for solutions to common issues before logging a support case.

* Alfresco Product Documentation

    The officially supported [Alfresco Documentation](/) has all the current information on installing, configuring, using, administering, customizing, and extending the major versions of Alfresco products.

Should you not find your answer using the self-service tools, please log a support case using one of the following methods:

* Hyland Community Support Cases

    Hyland Support has a web interface that you can use to log a new support case, update an open existing case or review previously closed cases.

* Telephone - recommended logging method for Severity 1 issues

    For all issues, we recommend logging a support case first so we are looking at the same information you have in real-time.

    Phone contact information is located on the Community **Technical Support Contact Information** page.
