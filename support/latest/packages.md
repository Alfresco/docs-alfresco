## Standard Support

Ideal for high-availability systems, Standard Support offers fast response times. Any production system down issue (Severity Level 1) is responded to on a 24x7 basis. Our Analysts work with your team to address the issue in the shortest possible time. Any other severity issues are initially responded to within the targeted service level response time.

See the [Service Level Targets (SLTs)]({% link support/latest/slt.md %})) section for more details.
