## Standard Support

Ideal for high-availability systems, Standard Support offers fast response times. Any production system down issue (Severity Level 1) is responded to on a 24x7 basis. Our Analysts work with your team to address the issue in the shortest possible time. Any other severity issues are initially responded to within the targeted service level response time.

See the [Service Level Targets (SLTs)]({% link support/latest/slt.md %}) section for more details.

## Alfresco Partner Support

If you need local language support, you may like to consider working with one of the Hyland's Support Partners.

Hyland Support Partners can help you with planning your solution, through implementation, transfer of knowledge, and full support under one of the aforementioned support packages.
