title: License Keys

All major and minor versions of Alfresco Content Services and Alfresco Process Services require a customer specific license key.

These license keys are customer specific keys. When one upgrades to a major or minor product version, you will need to request a new product license key. In addition, any Service Pack release can be applied and your license key can still be installed on multiple servers based on your product subscription purchase. If you have any questions, please contact Alfresco Support or your Customer Success Manager.

Partner licenses keys are available for use on Partner's test and development servers. If a Partner would like to use any Alfresco product for an internal project, you will need to upgrade your Partner subscription â€“ please contact your channel account manager or send a note to the sales team [sales@alfresco.com](mailto:sales@alfresco.com).
