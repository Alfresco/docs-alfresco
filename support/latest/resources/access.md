## Building Alfresco products using SDKs

Several Alfresco products can be built using SDKs. To see a list of available SDKs, refer to the [Alfresco Documentation](/).

Most SDKs require Maven and access to the Alfresco Nexus repository. Please contact Alfresco Support for credentials to the Nexus repository.

## Access to Alfresco product source code

Source code for most Alfresco products, including ACS, APS, and many modules, is available at the Alfresco Nexus repository in the form of a product `sources.jar`, or available in GitHub:

If you are unable to locate the source code for a product or module, or need credentials to the Nexus repository, please contact Alfresco Support.

> **Note:** If you modify the code beyond basic extensions, you will invalidate your support contract. To ensure this does not occur, please contact Alfresco with your proposed changes.
