title: Severity Definitions
---

Here are the severity definitions that Alfresco Support uses when prioritizing and working on your issue. If you are able to help us by reserving the selection of Severity One(1) for your most critical issues, you can be sure that the Alfresco Support team responds appropriately.

|Severity|Definition|
|--------|----------|
|1 - Production System Down|A Severity One issue indicates the production system is completely shut down or system operations or mission-critical applications are down. A Severity One issue includes an application that is in final testing, facing a critical Production Use go-live time frame or the entire development efforts are blocked. Alfresco promptly initiates the following procedures:{::nomarkdown}<ol><li>Assigns specialist(s) to correct the Error on an expedited basis.<li>Provides ongoing communication on the status.<li>Begins to provide a temporary workaround or fix.</ol>The assumption is that customer resources are available during the contractual service hours, as necessary, to collaborate on a workaround or fix.|
|2 - Major Impact|A Severity Two issue indicates the production system is functioning but severely impacted with limited capabilities, or is unstable with major periodic interruptions, or mission critical applications, while not being affected, have experienced material system interruptions. A Severity Two issue may also indicate there is a time sensitive question impacting performance or deliverables, or a major subsystem under development is blocked. Alfresco assigns a specialist, and provides additional, escalated procedures as determined necessary by Alfresco Support Services staff. Alfresco exercises commercially reasonable efforts to provide a workaround or include a fix for the Severity Two issue in the next Service Pack/Maintenance Release.|
|3 - Minor Impact|A Severity Three issue indicates the production system is still functioning but capabilities are moderately impacted, or the system is unstable with minor periodic interruptions or a minor loss of product functionality. A Severity Three issue can also indicate there are errors in system development that may be impacting performance deliverables. There is a medium-to-low impact on your business, but your business continues to function, including by using a procedural workaround.|
|4 - Question - How To - Enhancement|A Severity Four issue is a general usage question, request for information, reporting of a documentation error, or recommendation for a future product enhancement or modification.Â  There is low-to-no impact on your business or the performance or functionality of your system.|
