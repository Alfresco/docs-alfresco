title: Severity Definitions
---

The outlined Hyland Support severity definitions are utilized when prioritizing and working on your issue. Reserve communication of Severity Level One (1) for your most critical issues (production environment down) to ensure the Hyland Support team can respond to all issues appropriately.

| Severity | Definition |
| -------- | ---------- |
| Level 1 | "Level 1" means any Error that causes total or substantial software failure, which means that the software is down and the customer is unable to access the software in any way within their production environment. |
| Level 2 | "Level 2" means an Error that causes substantial software failure which prevents a portion of a customerâ€™s users from accessing the software in any way within the production environment. |
| Level 3 | "Level 3" means that the software is usable except that an Error causes an ongoing, system-wide, severe performance degradation. |
| Level 4 | "Level 4" means that the software is usable except that an Error prevents a specific feature or functionality from working. |
| Level 5 | "Level 5" means that the software is usable except that an Error causes a trivial inconvenience and the task can be completed in another way. |
| Level 6 | "Level 6" means Technical Support Services. |

"Error" means any defect or condition inherent in the software which is reported by a customer and which is confirmed by Hyland, that causes the software to fail to function in any material respect as described in the documentation.

## Technical Support Services

Hyland will provide online or phone technical support related to problems reported by a customer and associated with the operation of any supported software, including assistance and advice related to the operation of the software. Technical Support Services are not available for retired software.

## Error Correction Services

With respect to any Errors in the supported software which are reported by a customer and which are confirmed by Hyland, in the exercise of its reasonable judgment, Hyland will use its commercially reasonable efforts to correct the Error, which may be effected by a commercially reasonable workaround.  Hyland shall promptly commence to confirm any reported Errors after receipt of a proper report of such suspected Error from a customer.  Hyland may elect to correct the Error in the current available release, or in the next available commercially released version of the supported software and the resolution may require the customer to implement an upgrade and enhancement in order to obtain the correction. Error Correction Services are not available for retired software.
