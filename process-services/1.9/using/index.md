title: Overview of using Process Services
---

The [Process Services application]({% link process-services/1.9/using/process/index.md %}) describes how to model process definitions, forms and decision tables.

[Process Workspace]({% link process-services/1.9/using/workspace.md %}) is an alternative end-user interface for starting and managing tasks and processes that are currently running.

> **Note:** Process Workspace is only compatible with Process Services up to and including version 1.9.

To quickly get started with Process Services by creating, publishing and using your first application, see the [Getting Started Guide]({% link process-services/1.9/using/getting-started.md %}).
