title: Alfresco Process Services
---

Process Services is an enterprise Business Process Management (BPM) solution targeted at business people and developers. At its core is a high performance open-source business process engine based on [Activiti](https://www.activiti.org/){:target="_blank"} with the flexibility and scalability to handle a wide variety of critical processes. Process Services provides a powerful suite of end user tools and integrates with a range of enterprise systems, including Alfresco Content Services, Box and Google Drive.

Starting from Process Service 24.1, six out-of-the box workflows provide a faster time to value for these frequently used simple workflows. The workflows are for assigning tasks, review, and approval:

* New Task
* New Task (group)
* Review and Approve (group review)
* Review and Approve (one or more reviewers)
* Review and Approve (pooled review)
* Review and Approve (single reviewer)
