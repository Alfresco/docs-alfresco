title: Task App

Use the Task App to access your task list and work on tasks assigned to you from the Processes tab. 
This is also where you initiate new processes and tasks.

![App My Tasks]({% link process-services/images/app-my-tasks.png %})

The Task App menu bar has tabs for working with tasks, processes, reports, and a Start button, which is a shortcut to 
start a process using a published process definition.

>**Note:** If you haven’t created any tasks for yourself, and there are no tasks assigned for you from current processes or from other users, then James will appear with shortcuts to help you create a task or start a published process.

## Tasks tab

The Tasks tab is organized into three columns.

* The left column lets you filter the list of displayed tasks. There are four pre-defined filters and a New Filter control which lets you define and name your own filters. Any filters you create are added to the list of displayed filters.
* The middle column provides tools for creating new tasks, and lists the tasks included by the current active filter. Click on the accordion icon above the list of tasks to change the default display order from Newest first to oldest first, Due last order, or Due first order.
* The right column is displayed when you click on a task in the middle column. It displays the selected task details and also tools for completing open tasks and for viewing the audit log of a completed task.

>**Note:** The Audit log button is only available for a completed process instance or a completed task.

### Using the new filter in tasks and processes

When you create a new filter in the Tasks tab or Processes tab, you can filter by process definition, 
the state of the task/process, by task name, and by assignment. You can also change the default sort order.

* **Process definition**

    Select an active (running) process name, and display only those tasks that are associated with that process.

* **State**

    Choose to display tasks or processes based on its state. For tasks, select Completed or Open. Completed is selected by default. For processes, select Running, complete, or All. Running is selected by default.

* **Assignment**

    Select tasks in which you are involved, or tasks that have been assigned to you, or tasks where you are one of the several candidates. This is only applicable to the Tasks tab.

* **Sort**

    Sort the list by Newest first, Oldest first, Due last, or Due first.

* **Task name / Process Name**

    Type a string to search for matching task names or process name depending on the tab you’re in.

* **Filter icon and name**

    Select an icon for your new filter by clicking on the funnel icon, and specify a name for the filter.

>**Note:** If you have no tasks or processes running, then James will appear with a shortcut to let you create a new task for yourself or start an existing process and track its progress.

## Processes tab

Use the Processes tab to start a new process from a list of published process definitions. The Processes tab is organized 
into three columns similar to the Tasks tab (see above) except that instead of tasks, process details are displayed. 
You can also create a new filter to filter by process definitions, process state, and by process name.

## Reports tab

Use the Reports tab to generate reports based on the available parameters. You can view the reports that you saved in 
the Analytics App. For more information, see [Analytics App]({% link process-services/latest/using/analytics.md %}).
