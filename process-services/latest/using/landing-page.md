title: Using the the Landing page
---

The Landing Page is your user interface to Process Services. Each tile gives you tools for distinct sets of tasks:

![Activiti App Landing Page]({% link process-services/images/gs-dashboard.png %})

The Landing Page is the starting point from which you can use:

* **App Designer** - to design your processes.
* **My Tasks** - to view your task inbox or queue.
* **Profile management** / **Identity management** - to manage user and group capabilities
* **Analytics** - to generate reports on process performance

Depending on the capabilities of your account you may or may not get access to the **App Designer** or **Analytics**.

**Profile management** will appear for you only if you are a user. This is where you manage your 
personal information. If you have administrator capabilities, then **Profile management** will be displayed 
as **Identity management**. Use this tile to access your profile page as well as to manage user, group, and 
capability management pages for your tenant or the whole system.

You can click on the Process Services logo at any time to return to your landing page.

Your landing page is dynamic, and new tiles will appear when you create new process apps in the App Designer and 
deploy them in the Task App.

You'll also see a list of shortcuts for tasks you might want to do next.

>**Note:** If you are an administrator, your landing page is slightly different. Instead of the Profile management tile, youâ€™ll find a more powerful set of tools called the Identity management tile.

All pages display the App Navigator icon in the far-right corner of the header. It provides useful 1-click shortcuts to various parts of the app. You can navigate instantly to all your process models, tasks, processes, stencils, forms, decision tables, quickly start any process, view the tasks and processes for a published and deployed app, or view and change your profile. As you deploy process apps, the App Navigator will also show shortcuts for the newly created process apps.
