title: Preconfigured workflows
---

Tasks and workflows help you keep track of the things you and other users need to do. You can create a standalone task or workflow, or you can attach a file to it.

A workflow is a process that controls a specific task, such as a document review. Each task can be assigned to one or more people when a workflow is being created. Workflow creators can select to automatically send a notification email to users that are assigned a task as part of the workflow, but whether an email is sent or not the task will be visible in the users My Tasks.

Once all the task actions required by a workflow have been finished, the workflow will move from active to completed status. At this point you’re free to delete the workflow.
Individual users manage their own tasks, and the person who created a workflow manages the workflow.

Starting from Process Services 24.1, six out-of-the box workflows provide a faster time to value for these frequently used simple workflows. The workflows are for assigning tasks, review, and approval:

* New Task
* New Task (group)
* Review and Approve (group review)
* Review and Approve (one or more reviewers)
* Review and Approve (pooled review)
* Review and Approve (single reviewer)

There are several stages to setting up a Preconfigured Workflows app before you can use it. To enable the Preconfigured workflows, ensure that the `app.review-workflows.enabled` property is set to `true` in the `activiti-app.properties` file. 


To get started:

1. Create a tenant.

      This is when you enable the **Preconfigured workflows** app.

2. Change the owner.

3. Configure a preconfigured workflow.

4. Create a user.

5. Create a group.

6. Start a workflow.

Once a workflow has been created, you can also:

* View workflows that you started.
* Cancel an active workflow.
* Delete a completed workflow.
* View tasks and workflows.
* Manage tasks.
