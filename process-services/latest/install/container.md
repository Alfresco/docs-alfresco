title: Install using containers
---

There are two options for installing Process Services using containers:

* For trials, testing and development it's recommended to deploy with Docker for Desktop.
* For production environments, there's a reference Helm chart available for installation into a Kubernetes cluster.

> **Note:** See the [Deployment and Containerization Support Policy]({% link support/latest/policies/deployment.md %}) for information regarding the supportability of Docker images and Helm charts.

## Install with Docker

Process Services and Process Services Administrator can be deployed using separate Docker containers.

The Docker images for Process Services are available on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/u/alfresco/){:target="_blank"}.

To download the images from Docker Hub, use the following commands:

```bash
docker pull alfresco/process-services:2.4.x
```

```bash
docker pull alfresco/process-services-admin:2.4.x
```

>**Note:** If a tag isn't supplied then the latest version will be downloaded.

To run the containers locally using Docker for Desktop, use the following commands specifying a port for them to map to:

```bash
docker run -p {port}:8080 alfresco/process-services
```

```bash
docker run -p {port}:8080 alfresco/process-services-admin
```

For example, to run Process Services Administrator on port 8095 use the following:

```bash
docker run -p 8095:8080 alfresco/process-services-admin
```

Once the containers have started up, visit the following URLs to access the applications:

* `http://localhost:{port}/activiti-app`
* `http://localhost:{port}/activiti-admin`

For example `http://localhost:8095/activiti-admin` if running the Administrator application on port 8095.

>**Note:** Docker for Desktop is not a production environment.

It is possible to override the default environment variables for Process Services and Process Services Administrator,
see next sections.

### Configure Process Services variables

It is possible to override the default variable values used by the Docker container.

There are three options for specifying your own variables during a Docker deployment:

* Mount your own `activiti-app.properties` and optionally an `activiti-identity-service.properties` file in `/usr/local/tomcat/lib` using Docker volumes.
* Specifying environment variables for each properties file that points to an accessible location such as an S3 bucket:

    * Use the `EXTERNAL_ACTIVITI_APP_PROPERTIES_FILE` environment variable for an `activiti-app.properties` file.
    * Use the `EXTERNAL_ACTIVITI_IDENTITY_SERVICE_PROPERTIES_FILE` environment variable for an `activiti-identity-service.properties` file.
        >**Note:** If you choose this option, the files will be automatically downloaded into the contextual folder.
* Configure the environment variables in the Docker container by overriding the default values.

Variables that correspond to the `activiti-app.properties` file:

## Install on Amazon EKS

Use the following information as a reference guide to deploy Process Services on Amazon's Elastic Container Service for Kubernetes (Amazon EKS).

**Important:** Deployment on AWS such as with Amazon EKS, is only recommended for customers with a good knowledge of Process Services, and strong competencies in AWS and containerized deployment.

There are several prerequisites for deploying on Amazon EKS using Helm charts:

* An Amazon EKS environment. See [Amazon's EKS getting started Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/getting-started.html){:target="_blank"} as a reference point.
* A Kubernetes namespace configured for Process Services.
* Helm and Tiller configured in the Kubernetes cluster. See [Helm's quickstart guide](https://docs.helm.sh/using_helm/#quickstart-guide){:target="_blank"} for reference.

Use the following steps to deploy Process Services, Process Services Administrator, a Postgres database and optionally the [Identity Service]({% link identity-service/1.2/index.md %}):

1. Create a Kubernetes secret to access images in Quay.

    1. Sign into Quay.io with your credentials using the following command:

        ```bash
        docker login quay.io
        ```

    2. Generate a base64 value for your `dockercfg` using one of the following commands:

        ```bash
        # Linux
        cat ~/.docker/config.json | base64
        ```

        ```bash
        # Windows
        base64 -w 0 ~/.docker/config.json
        ```

    3. Create a file called `secrets.yaml` and add the following content to it, using your base64 string from the previous step as the `.dockerconfigjson` value:

        ```yaml
        apiVersion: v1
        kind: Secret
        metadata:
          name: quay-registry-secret
        type: kubernetes.io/dockerconfigjson
        data:
          .dockerconfigjson: <your-base64-string>
        ```

    4. Upload your `secrets.yaml` file to the namespace you are deploying into using the following command:

        ```bash
        kubectl create -f <file-location>/secrets.yaml --namespace=$NAMESPACE
        ```

2. Create a Kubernetes secret for the Process Services license file with the following command:

    ```bash
    kubectl create secret generic licenseaps --from-file=./activiti.lic
    --namespace=$NAMESPACE
    ```

3. Add the Alfresco Kubernetes repository to Helm with the following command:

    ```bash
    helm repo add alfresco-stable https://kubernetes-charts.alfresco.com/stable
    ```

4. [Update the properties](#helm-properties) for the Process Services chart.

5. **(Optional)**: To enable the Identity Service:

    1. Enable the Identity Service in the `alfresco-infrastructure` section of the `values.yaml`:

        ```text
        alfresco-identity-service:
        enabled: true
        ```

    2. Set the Process Services environment variable `IDENTITY_SERVICE_ENABLED` to `true`.

    3. Set the Process Services environment variable `IDENTITY_SERVICE_AUTH` to `http://$DNS/auth`.

6. Deploy the chart using a command similar to the following:

    ```bash
    helm install alfresco-stable/alfresco-process-services --set dnsaddress="http://$DNS" --namespace=$NAMESPACE --set license.secretName=licenseaps
    ```

The applications will be available at the following URLs:

* Process Services: `http://$DNS/activiti-app`
* Process Services Administrator: `http://$DNS/activiti-admin`
* Identity Service administrator console: `http://$DNS/auth/admin`

>**Note:** To change the context paths of any of the applications, edit the ingress paths:

```yaml
ingress:
    path: /activiti-app
```
