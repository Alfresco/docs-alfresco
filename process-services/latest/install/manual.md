title: Install manually
---

There are two options for installing Process Services without using containers, depending on the environment you are deploying in:

* For trials, testing and development it's recommended to install using a setup wizard.
* For production environments it is recommended that you install manually.

## Install using setup wizards

There are setup wizards available for Linux, macOS and Windows operating systems.

> **Important**: The setup wizards are evaluation copies that are useful for trials and experimentation. The h2 database provided with them is not suitable for use in a production environment.

The setup wizards install their own Apache Tomcat container for Process Services, an h2 database and all prerequisite software for Process Services to run on your chosen operating system.

{% capture linux %}

Use these instructions to install Process Services on Linux.

1. Download the Linux setup wizard from your trial email.

2. Locate the bin you just downloaded and run the following command against it to update its permissions:

    ```bash
    chmod 777 <installer file name>
    ```

3. Run the setup wizard using the following command:

    ```bash
    ./<installer file name>
    ```

4. Read and accept the **License Agreement**.

After installing you will need to [apply a valid license file](#license) to your installation.

## Install manually

To install Process Services and the administrator application manually, download the relevant Web Application Archive (WAR) files.

It is recommended that you install the administrator application in a separate container to Process Services in a production environment. It is possible to install the two applications in the same web container, however separate containers allows them to be managed in isolation from one another.

The download files are available from [Hyland Community](https://community.hyland.com/){:target="_blank"}.

### Install Process Services

Use these instructions to install the Process Services application using the WAR file.

Ensure you have read the [supported platforms]({% link process-services/latest/support/index.md %}) to confirm that your web container and database combination is supported before commencing with installation.

1. Install your web container and database.

    >**Note:** The following steps use Tomcat and MySQL for examples.

2. Create a schema for the `activiti-app` application. The default name is `activiti`

    In MySQL:

    ```sql
    CREATE DATABASE activiti DEFAULT CHARACTER SET utf8 DEFAULT COLLATE utf8_general_ci;
    ```

3. Create a user and password. This example will use `alfresco/alfresco`

    In MySQL:

    ```sql
    CREATE USER 'alfresco'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'alfresco';
    ```

4. Grant full privileges on the schema to this new user.

    In MySQL:

    ```sql
    GRANT ALL ON activiti.* TO 'alfresco'@'localhost';
    ```

5. Edit the `activiti-app.properties` file supplied with the WAR file.

    1. Uncomment the correct properties for the database you have installed.

    2. Update the values for the schema and credentials created in the previous steps and check that the `hibernate.dialect` property matches your chosen database type.

        For example:

        ```text
        com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver
        datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://127.0.0.1:3306/activiti?characterEncoding=UTF-8
        datasource.username=alfresco
        datasource.password=alfresco
        hibernate.dialect=org.hibernate.dialect.MySQLDialect
        ```

        >**Note:** Example syntax is provided in the `activiti-app.properties` file for other database types.

        > **Important:** Ensure that the driver for your database is on the classpath of the web application.

    3. Set a location for the file content to be at using `contentstorage.fs.rootFolder`.
       
        > **Important:** Ensure that the path exists; for example if you set `contentstorage.fs.rootFolder=/var/lib/act_data` the path `/var/lib/act_data` must exist and be accessible by the process user.  
        > If the folder doesn't exist them you won't be able to upload files from your pc to Activiti.
 
    4. Set a location for the search and analytics indexes using `elastic-search.data.path`.

6. Ensure that the driver for your database is on the classpath of your web container.

    For Tomcat and MySQL:

    Copy the MySQL java connector jar to `<Tomcat install location>/lib`

7. Copy the `activiti-app.war` and `activiti-app.properties` files to your web container.

    For Tomcat:

    * `<Tomcat install location>/webapps/activiti-app.war`
    * `<Tomcat install location>/lib/activiti-app.properties`

8. Start up your web container.

    For Tomcat:

    * On Linux or MacOS run `<Tomcat install location>\\bin\\catalina.sh`
    * On Windows run `<Tomcat install location>/bin/catalina.bat`

9. Enter `http://localhost:8080/activiti-app` into a browser to begin using Process Services.

After installing you will need to [apply a valid license file](#license) to your installation.

### Install Process Services Administrator

Use these instructions to install Process Services Administrator using the WAR file.

Ensure you have read the [supported platforms]({% link process-services/latest/support/index.md %}) to confirm that your web container and database combination is supported before commencing with installation.

1. Install your web container and database.

    >**Note:** The following steps use Tomcat and MySQL for examples.

2. Create a schema for the `activiti-admin` application. The default name is `activitiadmin`

    In MySQL:

    ```sql
    CREATE DATABASE activitiadmin DEFAULT CHARACTER SET utf8 DEFAULT COLLATE utf8_general_ci;
    ```

3. Create a user and password. This example will use `alfresco/alfresco`

    > **Important:** You do not need to complete this step if you use the same user you created when [installing Process Services](#install-process-services) and can skip to the next step.

    In MySQL:

    ```sql
    CREATE USER 'alfresco'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'alfresco';
    ```

4. Grant full privileges on the schema to this new user.

    In MySQL:

    ```sql
    GRANT ALL ON activitiadmin.* TO 'alfresco'@'localhost';
    ```

5. Edit the `activiti-admin.properties` file supplied with the main Process Services WAR file download.

    1. Uncomment the correct properties for the database you have installed.

    2. Update the values for the schema and credentials created in the previous steps and check that the `hibernate.dialect` property matches your chosen database type.

        For example:

        ```text
        com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver
        datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://127.0.0.1:3306/activitiadmin?characterEncoding=UTF-8
        datasource.username=alfresco
        datasource.password=alfresco
        hibernate.dialect=org.hibernate.dialect.MySQLDialect
        ```

        >**Note:** Example syntax is provided in the `activiti-admin.properties` file for other database types.

6. Copy the `activiti-admin.war` and `activiti-admin.properties` files to your web container.

    For Tomcat:

    * `<Tomcat install location>/webapps/activiti-admin.war`
    * `<Tomcat install location>/lib/activiti-admin.properties`

7. Start up your web container.

    For Tomcat:

    * On Linux or MacOS run `<Tomcat install location>\bin\catalina.sh`
    * On Windows run `<Tomcat install location>/bin/catalina.bat`

8. Enter `http://localhost:8080/activiti-admin` into a browser to begin using Process Services Administrator.

After installing you will need to [apply a valid license file](#license) to your installation.

## License

A valid license file is required to run Process Services.

Customers can download and request licenses from the Customer Portal in [Hyland Community](https://community.hyland.com/customer-portal/licensing/alfresco/request/){:target="_blank"}.

You can download a trial license from [https://www.hyland.com/alfresco/aps-trial-license/activiti-trial.zip](https://www.hyland.com/alfresco/aps-trial-license/activiti-trial.zip).

Logging into Process Services as an administrator will display a notification if a license is not currently valid.
Notifications are displayed when:

* No valid license file can be found
* A license file has expired or is not valid until a date in the future
* The current license file is close to expiring

There are two methods for uploading a license file to Process Services.

### Upload a license

To upload a license through the user interface:

1. Click the **UPLOAD LICENSE** button or use the top menu **Administrator** > **Upload license**

2. Browse to, or drag your `activiti.lic` file into the pop-up.

Alternatively, you can manually move the `activiti.lic` file into the web container.

For example using Tomcat: `<Tomcat install location>\lib\`
