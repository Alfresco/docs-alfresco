title: Overview of using Process Services
---

The [Process Services application]({% link process-services/2.4/using/process/index.md %}) describes how to model process definitions, forms and decision tables.

* If you're planning to run Process Services with other Alfresco applications, you can use Alfresco Digital Workspace as the end-user interface by configuring the [Process Services extension]({% link digital-workspace/latest/process/index.md %}). This extension provides Process Services functionality for end users within Digital Workspace for starting and managing tasks and processes that are currently running.
* If you're planning to use Process Services as a standalone application, you'll need to develop a custom UI using the process component for the Application Development Framework (ADF). See the [ADF Documentation](https://www.alfresco.com/abn/adf/docs/){:target="_blank"} for more details.

To quickly get started with Process Services by creating, publishing and using your first application, see the [Getting Started Guide]({% link process-services/2.4/using/getting-started.md %}).
