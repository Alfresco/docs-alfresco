title: Getting started with Governance Services

## Overview

Although Governance Services has a huge amount of functionality available, it's actually pretty easy to learn the essentials and get up and running.

What you do in Governance Services will vary hugely depending on your role, and how your company is organized. 
This guide is split into two sections, one for [Governance Services managers]({% link governance-services/latest/starting/managers/overview.md %}), 
and one for [Governance Services users]({% link governance-services/latest/starting/users/overview.md %}). 
You might find that these guides don't exactly match what you do in your day-to-day job, 
but even if they don't you should find them useful in getting started, and in understanding the basic concepts 
of Governance Services and how the processes fit together.

Common for both roles is the record lifecycle. {% include governance-services/record-lifecycle.md %}
