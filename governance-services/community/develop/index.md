---

Governance Services provides two APIs, the GS Core API and the GS Security Marks API.

> **Note:** The GS Security Marks API isn't available in Governance Services Community Edition.

The APIs are designed for you to create remote clients to manage the {% include tooltip.html word="fileplan" text="File Plan" %}. You can easily explore and test the endpoints using the Governance Services API Explorer.

You can download the API Explorer from:

* [Alfresco Nexus repository](https://nexus.alfresco.com/nexus/#welcome){:target="_blank"}

The Governance Services distribution zip contains the `alfresco-governance-services-community-rest-api-explorer-23.2.x.xxx.war` file.

Deploy it on the same port as Governance Services and test the APIs with your server directly from the API Explorer.

The following table provides a brief overview of each API.

|API|Description|

|GS Security Marks API|The Security Marks API gives you access to the classification and security controls features of Governance Services. You can use it to manage classification guides, reasons, values, and declassification exemptions, as well as security control settings.|
