title: Governance Services Installation Options
---

This information guides you through installing Governance Services. You can use the containerized deployment 
method using Docker Compose, as there is no GUI installer, or you can install using the standard AMP files contained 
in the distribution zip.

There are two options for installing the Governance Service:

* [Install using Docker Compose]({% link governance-services/7.3/install/docker.md %}) Due to the limited capabilities of Docker Compose, this deployment method is recommended for development and test environments only.
* [Install using the distribution ZIP]({% link governance-services/7.3/install/zip.md %})

> **Note:** For more information about what containerized deployment and Docker Compose means, see the Alfresco Content Services deployment documentation - [Understanding containerized deployment]({% link content-services/latest/install/containers/index.md %}).

Instructions are also provided for [upgrading the Governance Service]({% link governance-services/7.3/upgrade/index.md %}).
