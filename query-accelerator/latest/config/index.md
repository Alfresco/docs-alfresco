title: Overview

Use the following information to configure Query Accelerator. 
The query set configurations define the denormalized tables that will be created to support faster queries.

| Attribute        | Description |
| ---------------- | ----------- |
| version          | The version of the query set. |
| name             | The table name. The actual database table name will have a prefix of 'alf_qs_' and a suffix of '_v' plus the version. So for a query set called of 'test1' and a version of 1 that actual database table name would be 'alf_qs_test1_v1'. |
| properties       | A collection of properties to appear on the denormalized table. A property consists of a name attribute which is the name of a property and an isIndex attribute which indicates that the related column on the table should be indexed.            |
| aspects          | A collection of aspects to appear on the denormalized table. The table will have a boolean column for each of the aspects to indicate if the node has those aspects applied. An aspect consists of a name attribute which is the name of an aspect and an isIndex attribute which indicates that the related column on the table should be indexed. |
| compositeIndexes | A collection of composite indexes to be created for the table. A composite index consists of an attribute where the attribute name is the index name and the attribute value is a collection of names of properties and/or aspects of the query set. |

* The maximum length of the query set name and the version is the maximum table name length of the database system being used,
  minus 9. So for Postgres, which has a maximum table name length of 63 bytes, the maximum name and version length in
  the query set is 54 bytes.
* Queries that include negations on aspects should not be accelerated.
* Properties of type MLTEXT are NOT supported. If included a WARN message will be logged,
  the properties will be ignored, and the corresponding denormalized table will be created without them.
* The denormalized table will have an alf_type column, holding the name of the content type.
* When aspects are used, the denormalized table will contain only the nodes that have at least one of the aspect.
  It is for this reason that a query checking for the absence of an aspect will not use the query accelerator
  and will be performed by the standard engine.
* Auditable properties (namely: cm:creator, cm:created, cm:modifier, cm:modified and cm:accessed) defined in the configuration
  will be ignored. Data of this nature is always available and there is no need to store it on the corresponding denormalised
  table.
* Properties of the following types defined in the configuration will be ignored. If included a WARN message will be logged, as the properties are already included in the denormalized table:
  + cm:owner
  + cm:noderef
  + sys:node-dbid
  + sys:node-uuid
* When files are read from the `queryAccelerator.config.dir` directory they are read in
  alphanumeric order. So _0101-coyote.json_ would be read before _0102-coyote.json_ and it is
  read before _0201-acme.json_.

## Query set configuration examples

### Example 1
This first example is intentionally simple but should work on any system, providing a basic understanding of how the system works.

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "name": "Test01",
  "properties": [
    {
      "name": "cm:name",
      "isIndex": true
    },
    {
      "name": "cm:author",
      "isIndex": true
    }
  ],
  "aspects": [
    {
      "name": "cm:titled",
      "isIndex": true
    }
  ],
  "compositeIndexes": {
    "index_1": ["cm:name", "cm:author"],
    "index_2": ["cm:name", "cm:titled"]
  }
}
```

ACS node properties:
![acs-node-properties]({% link query-accelerator/images/acs-properties.png %})
Table entry:

| node_id | owner_id | alf_type | cm_name   | cm_author   | cm_titled |
| ------- | -------- | -------- | --------- | ----------- | --------- |
| 887     | 3        | 24       | demo1.txt | Joe Bloggs  | true      |

### Example 2
The following example requires that at least one node in the system has the DublinCore aspect applied. This aspect is
part of the system by default. If there are no nodes, an unknown property error is reported.

```json
{
  "version": 6,
  "name": "ac",
  "properties": [
    {
      "name": "cm:name",
      "isIndex": true
    },
    {
      "name": "cm:publisher",
      "isIndex": true
    }
  ],
  "aspects": [
    {
      "name": "cm:titled",
      "isIndex": true
    },
    {
      "name": "cm:dublincore",
      "isIndex": true
    }
  ],
  "compositeIndexes": {
    "index_1": ["cm:name", "cm:publisher"],
    "index_2": ["cm:name", "cm:titled"]
  }
}
```

ACS node properties and aspects:
![acs-node-aspects]({% link query-accelerator/images/acs-aspects.png %})
Table entry:

| node_id | owner_id | alf_type | cm_name   | cm_publisher | cm_titled | cm_dublincore |
| ------- | -------- | -------- | --------- | ------------ | --------- | ------------- |
| 918     | 3        | 24       | demo2     | Egmont       | true      | true          |

## Query Sets and Transaction Meta-Data Queries (TMDQ)

Here we give an example of how to create a Query Set to replace a TMDQ.

The following TMDQ selects all documents (cm:content) which have a dublincore aspect (cm:dublincore), a
publisher (cm:publisher) equal to 'Hachette Livre' and a type (cm:type) equal to 'Action'.

```
{
   "query":{
      "query":"select * from cmis:document as d join cm:dublincore as dc on d.cmis:objectId = dc.cmis:objectId where dc.cm:publisher = 'Hachette Livre' and dc.cm:type='Action'",
      "language":"cmis"
   }
}
```
The following Query Set would be able to support the above TMDQ. It also requires that at least one node in the system
has the DublinCore aspect applied.

```json
{
  "version": "1",
  "name": "doc_dublincore",
  "properties": [
    {
      "name": "cm:publisher",
      "isIndex": true
    },
    {
      "name": "cm:type",
      "isIndex": true
    }
  ],
  "aspects": [
    {
      "name": "cm:dublincore",
      "isIndex": true
    }
  ]
}
```

## Query Set Status and Caching

Denormalized tables have a status. For example:

| Name | Version | State | Notes |
| ---- | ------- | ----- | ----- |
| tableA | 1 | OBSOLETE | Should be removed |
| tableA | 2 |  RETIRED | Can be removed |
| tableA | 3 |  LIVE | Currently being used |
| tableA | 4 |  INPROGRESS | Created but not fully populated yet, so cannot be used |
| tableA | 5 |  NEW | Seen but population of denormalized data has not started |

The transition from NEW to INPROGRESS will normally happen almost immediately.

## Logging

The admin console currently only indicates if updates were detected. For a more complete picture of the query sets configuration DEBUG logging must be used:

```bash
log4j.logger.org.alfresco.enterprise.repo.queryaccelerator=debug
```

Logs when a Query Set Refresh was performed but there are no updates:

```bash
2021-01-14 17:12:33,020  DEBUG [repo.queryaccelerator.QuerySetConfigServiceImpl] [http-bio-8080-exec-6] Refreshing query sets - checking for updates...

```

Logs when a Query Set Refresh has started:

```bash

```

It is also possible to obtain detailed logs for the query engine. The logs provide information about the process 
of selecting the query set, based on the query, by activating the DEBUG level, as in this example:

```bash
log4j.logger.org.alfresco.repo.search.impl.querymodel.impl.db=debug
```

Logs when a query is accepted by the engine:

```bash
15:02:26,097  DEBUG [impl.db.DBQueryEngine] [http-bio-8080-exec-10] Query request received
15:02:26,098  DEBUG [impl.db.DBQueryEngine] [http-bio-8080-exec-10] - query is being prepared

15:06:43,328  DEBUG [impl.db.DBQueryEngine] [http-bio-8080-exec-10] - using denormalised table for the query
```

Logs when a query is refused by the engine:

```bash
15:26:54,753  DEBUG [impl.db.DBQueryEngine] [http-bio-8080-exec-3] Query request received
15:26:54,753  DEBUG [impl.db.DBQueryEngine] [http-bio-8080-exec-3] - query is being prepared
