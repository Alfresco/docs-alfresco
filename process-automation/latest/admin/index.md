Administration is used to deploy the projects created through modeling and manage the processes and tasks created within the deployed applications.

## Admin Application

The Admin Application is where released projects created in the [Modeling Application]({% link process-automation/latest/model/index.md %}) can be deployed. Once a released project has been deployed it is referred to as an application.

The Admin Application is accessed using the `/admin` URL, for example `https://alfresco.com/admin`.

There are three main areas the Admin Application covers:

* A [DevOps section]({% link process-automation/latest/admin/release.md %}) used to deploy projects, and manage and upgrade applications.
* A  [Process Admin section]({% link process-automation/latest/admin/monitor.md %}) used to manage process instances, tasks and the audit details of all applications.
* An [Identity section]({% link process-automation/latest/admin/users.md %}) used to manage users and groups and assign their permissions.
