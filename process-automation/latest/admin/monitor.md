title: Process administration
---

The **Process Admin** section of the Admin Application is used to manage applications, process instances, user tasks, service tasks, auditing, and data cleanup.

Users can only see this section if they have the `ACTIVITI_ADMIN` role. The information that a user sees in each section is then controlled by which applications they have been given administrator access to during [deployment]({% link process-automation/latest/admin/release.md %}#deployment) or afterwards by [updating the application permissions]({% link process-automation/latest/admin/release.md %}#manage-permissions).

## Configure columns

You can configure the columns of the Applications List, Process Instances, User Tasks, and Service Tasks lists in the Admin App.

The order of the columns can be adjusted.

1. Expand the **Process Admin** section on the left of the Admin App and then select **Applications list**, **Process Instances**, **User Tasks**, or **Service Tasks**.

2. Access the six dots on the top left of a column by hovering your mouse over the name of the column.

3. Click and hold the six dots and then move the column on top of another column.

    This moves the columns to the left one position and the column you are moving takes the place of the one underneath.

The columns that are visible can be adjusted.

1. Expand the **Process Admin** section on the left of the Admin App and then select **Applications list**, **Process Instances**, **User Tasks**, or **Service Tasks**.

2. Click the three dots on the right of the last column.

3. Select which columns you want show and then click **Apply**.
