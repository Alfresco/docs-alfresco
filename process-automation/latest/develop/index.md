title: Develop Process Automation
---

The custom development of Process Automation is restricted to four areas:

* Communicating with external systems from an application.
* Extend the Digital Workspace interface for end users.
* Develop a custom user interface using the Application Development Framework (ADF).
* Implementing custom form fields.

## External systems communication

Communication with an external system should use the [REST connector]({% link process-automation/latest/model/connectors/rest.md %}) or the [Lambda connector]({% link process-automation/latest/model/connectors/aws.md %}#lambda).

> **Important**: The REST service and the AWS Lambda account and function need to be hosted outside of the Alfresco hosted environment.

Both connectors can send and return JSON payloads from a process. The REST connector can also be configured as a [trigger]({% link process-automation/latest/model/triggers.md %}#webhooks) for webhooks.

## Extend the Digital Workspace

The default [end user interface]({% link process-automation/latest/model/interfaces.md %}) provided with Process Automation is the [Alfresco Digital Workspace]({% link digital-workspace/latest/index.md %}).

> **Note**: The Digital Workspace can be extended to customize the branding and components. If your requirement is to customize large parts of the Digital Workspace then consider [developing a custom user interface](#develop-a-custom-user-interface) instead.

### Setup

To start developing Digital Workspace customizations:

1. Request the source code from [Support](https://support.alfresco.com/){:target="_blank"}.

2. Unzip the source code into your development environment and create a `.env` file in the root folder.

3. Insert the following contents in the `.env` file:

    ```bash
    # GENERAL
    AUTH_TYPE="OAUTH"
    PROVIDER="ALL"
    LOG_LEVEL="TRACE"
    ACA_BRANCH="develop"

    # ADW + APA
    API_HOST="https://..."
    API_CONTENT_HOST="https://..."
    API_PROCESS_HOST="https://..."
    OAUTH_HOST="https://..."
    IDENTITY_HOST="https://..."

    PLUGIN_PROCESS_SERVICE=true

    APP_CONFIG_APPS_DEPLOYED="[{"name": "..."}]"
    ```

4. Update the contents of the `.env` file with the following:

    | Property | Description |
    | -------- | ----------- |
    | API_HOST | The API host for the environment in the format `https://alfresco.com`. |
    | API_CONTENT_HOST | The API host for the content services in the format `https://alfresco.com`. |
    | API_PROCESS_HOST | The API host for the process services in the format `https://alfresco.com`. |
    | OAUTH_HOST | The authentication host in the format `https://alfresco.com/auth/realms/alfresco`. |
    | IDENTITY_HOST | The identity service host in the format `https://alfresco.com/auth/realms/alfresco`. |
    | APP_CONFIG_APPS_DEPLOYED | The name of the deployed application to extend the Digital Workspace against. The name is set when the application is deployed, for example `[{"name": "invoice-approval-application"}]`. |

5. Run the following command from the root of your local Digital Workspace: `npm run start content-en-cloud`.

6. Your local Digital Workspace is now connected to your hosted Process Automation application and can be extended, tested and debugged.

### Develop

The Digital Workspace is built using the Application Development Framework. There are a set of [content components](https://www.alfresco.com/abn/adf/docs/content-services/){:target="_blank"} and a set of [process components](https://www.alfresco.com/abn/adf/docs/process-services-cloud/){:target="_blank"} that can be extended.

> **Note**: Process Automation uses the Process Services **Cloud** components.

### Upload

Once the extended Digital Workspace has been fully customized and tested it can be deployed.

1. Remove the `.env` file from your source code.

2. Upload your source code to your Alfresco S3 bucket.

    > **Note**: Please contact [Support](https://support.alfresco.com/){:target="_blank"} if you do not have the details of this bucket.

3. Raise a [Support request](https://support.alfresco.com/){:target="_blank"} with this information:

    * A link to the source code in S3.
    * The name of the application to update.

        > **Note**: This should match what is configured in the `app.config.json` for the interface.

    * The environment the application is deployed in.
    * When the application should be updated with the new interface.

## Develop a custom user interface

The [Application Development Framework (ADF)](https://www.alfresco.com/abn/adf/docs/){:target="_blank"} can be used to develop a custom [end user interface]({% link process-automation/latest/model/interfaces.md %}) from scratch.

### Setup {#custom-setup}

The Yeoman generator can be used to develop custom user interfaces for Process Automation.

1. Clone the [Yeoman generator project](https://github.com/Alfresco/generator-alfresco-adf-app/){:target="_blank"}.

2. Open `apps/utils.js` and remove the following two templates from being excluded:

    ```js
    const excludedTemplates = ['adf-cli-activiti-template', 'adf-cli-activiti-acs-template'];
    ```

3. Run the following command from the root of the project: `yo alfresco-adf-app`.

    1. Give the project a name.
    2. Select the option **Content and Process Services with Activiti** to develop an application using process and content components, or **Process Services with Activiti** if developing only with process components.
    3. Install any required dependencies.

4. Configure the security in the `app.config.json` of the generated application:

    ```json
    "$schema": "../node_modules/@alfresco/adf-core/app.config.schema.json",
        "ecmHost": "http://{hostname}{:port}",
        "bpmHost": "http://{hostname}{:port}",
        "identityHost": "https://{hostname}{:port}/auth/realms/alfresco",
        "providers": "ALL",
        "appName": "invoice-approval-application",
        "application": {
            "name": "Alfresco ADF Application"
        },

    "authType": "OAUTH",
    "oauth2": {
        "host": "https://{hostname}/auth/realms/alfresco",
        "clientId": "invoice-approval-application",
        "scope": "openid",
        "secret": "",
        "implicitFlow": true,
        "silentLogin": true,
        "redirectSilentIframeUri": "{protocol}//{hostname}{:port}/assets/silent-refresh.html",
        "redirectUri": "/",
        "redirectUriLogout": "/"
    },
    ```

5. Add the property `"alfresco-deployed-apps"` to the `app.config.json` with the name of the deployed application you are developing an interface for. For example, `"alfresco-deployed-apps": [{"name":"invoice-approval-application"}]`.

6. To develop the interface locally, CORS will need to be bypassed. Edit the `proxy.conf.js` replacing the `{hostname}` and `{realm}` with those relevant to your environment and realm:

    ```js
    module.exports = {
        "/auth/admin/realms/{realm}": {
            "target": "https://{hostname}",
            "secure": false,
            "pathRewrite": {
                "^/auth/admin/realms/{realm}": ""
            },
            "changeOrigin": true,
            "logLevel": "debug"
        },

        "/auth/realms/...": {
            "target": "https://{hostname}",
            "secure": false,
            "pathRewrite": {
                "^/auth/realms/{realm}": ""
            },
            "changeOrigin": true,
            "logLevel": "debug"
        },

        "/": {
            "target": "https://{hostname}",
            "secure": false,
            "changeOrigin": true,
            "logLevel": "debug"
        },

        "/alfresco": {
            "target": "https://{hostname}",
            "secure": false,
            "changeOrigin": true
        }
    }
    ```

### Develop {#custom-develop}

There are a set of [content components](https://www.alfresco.com/abn/adf/docs/content-services/){:target="_blank"} and a set of [process components](https://www.alfresco.com/abn/adf/docs/process-services-cloud/){:target="_blank"} that can be used to develop the custom user interface with. The content components can only be used if you selected the option **Content and Process Services with Activiti** when generating the application.

> **Note**: Process Automation uses the Process Services **Cloud** components.

### Upload {#custom-upload}

Once the custom interface has been fully developed and tested it can be deployed.

1. Upload your source code to your Alfresco S3 bucket.

    > **Note**: Please contact [Support](https://support.alfresco.com/){:target="_blank"} if you do not have the details of this bucket.

2. Raise a [Support request](https://support.alfresco.com/){:target="_blank"} with this information:

    * A link to the source code in S3.
    * The name of the application to update 

        > **Note**: This should match what is configured in the `app.config.json` for the interface.

    * The environment the application is deployed in.
    * When the application should be updated with the new interface.

## Custom form fields

To include custom form fields within a form, the [form field customizations](https://github.com/Alfresco/alfresco-ng2-components/blob/develop/docs/user-guide/extensibility.md){:target="_blank"} must be included in the [customization of Digital Workspace](#extend-the-digital-workspace) or the [development of a custom user interface](#develop-a-custom-user-interface).

> **Note**: The custom field can be [included in a form]({% link process-automation/latest/model/forms.md %}#custom-form-widgets) before the custom interface has been deployed.

## Clean up historical data

You can use the REST API or the Create cleanup job process from within the Admin App to clean up your historical data.

### Clean up using REST API

You can clean up historical data using the REST API by using specific keys as input paramaters.

| Property | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| `historicRetentionDays` | *Required.* The number of days to retain any completed or cancelled processes. |
| `processDefinitionKeys` | *Optional.* A list of process definition keys to clean up. If omitted, all current process definitions are queried from the database and applied to delete the criteria. The default is `null`. |
| `limitSize` | *Optional.* A parameter that specifies the delete query size limit for performance. The default is `1000` rows. |
| `schemaPrefix` | *Optional.* A parameter that specifies the schema prefix, i.e. `public`. The default is an empty string. |
| `async` | *Optional.* A parameter that specifies the job execution strategy via the task executor. The default is true. |

For example:

`POST /v1/admin/batch/jobs/executions/cleanup-query-process-instance-history-job`

```json
{
  "historicRetentionDays": 10,
  "processDefinitionKeys": ["ConnectorProcess", "HeadersConnectorProcess"],
  "limitSize": 100,
  "schemaPrefix": "public",
  "async": true
}
```

### Clean up using Create cleanup job

You can clean up historical data using the Create cleanup job process from within the Admin App.

1. Sign into the Admin App.

2. Expand **Process Admin** from the left pane.

3. Select **Data Cleanup**.

4. Click the **+** symbol on the top right to create a new cleanup job.

5. Select the application you want to run the Create cleanup job process for from the drop down menu.

6. Select the applications process definition you want to cleanup.

    You can select multiple process definitions. If you do not select a process definition for the application all process definitions are selected.

7. Select the period of time you want to retain any completed or cancelled processes.

8. Click **Yes I agree** to creating the cleanup job and then click **CREATE**.
