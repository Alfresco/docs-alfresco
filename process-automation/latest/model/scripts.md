title: Scripts
---

Scripts are used to execute a script as part of a process. Process variables can be passed to the script and the results of a script can be sent back to a process instance as process variables.

Script design uses the functionality of [Monaco](https://github.com/Microsoft/monaco-editor){:target="_blank"} and uses the [Graal javascript engine](https://github.com/graalvm/graaljs){:target="_blank"} for execution.

Scripts are added to a process definition using a [script task]({% link process-automation/latest/model/processes/bpmn.md %}#script-task).

## Properties

The basic properties of a script are:

| Property | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| Script name | *Required.* The name of the script. Must be in lowercase and between 1 and 26 characters in length. Alphanumeric characters and hyphens are allowed, however the name must begin with a letter and end alphanumerically, for example `order-script` |
| Language | *Required.* The development language the script is written in, for example `Javascript`. |
| Script description | *Optional.* A description of what the script should be used for, for example `Returns the prefixed order number.` |

## Create a script

To create a script:

1. Sign into the Modeling Application and open a project.

2. Click the **NEW** dropdown.

3. Select how to create the script:

    * **Create > Script** creates a new, empty script.

    * **Upload > Script** allows for uploading an existing script `.bin` file into the Modeling Application.

    Alternatively use the **+** or **Upload** buttons next to **Scripts** in the left-hand menu.

4. Enter a name and optional description.

## Script modeling

The Modeling Application contains two tabs for creating and managing scripts.

The **Script Editor** is the GUI for modeling scripts by typing in the declared language. The **Metadata** contains the properties related to the script.

### Simulation

Once a script has been written, it can be simulated by entering potential inputs and viewing their output.

In the UI click the **Simulate** button after entering the input values to simulate. The results will be populated in the outputs section.

## Variables

There are two types of variables associated with a script. Script variables are stored as JSON and are used to pass values between a process and a script. Declared variables are used within the script body itself.

### Script variables

Script variables can be used to pass and receive values from [process variables]({% link process-automation/latest/model/processes/index.md %}#process-variables).

The properties for a script variable are:

| Property | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| name | A unique name that can contain alphanumeric characters and underscores but must begin with a letter, for example `var_3` |
| type | A data type selected from a dropdown. See the following table for a list of data types, for example `String` |
| required | Sets whether the script variable must contain a value when the task is started, for example `false` |
| value | An optional default value for the script variable, for example `ice-cream` |

The data types that a script variable can be set as are:

| Type | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| String | A sequence of characters, for example `#Mint-Ice-Cream-4!` |
| Integer | A positive whole number, for example `642` |
| Boolean | A value of either `true` or `false` |
| Date | A specific date in the format `YYYY-MM-DD`, for example `2020-04-22` |
| Datetime | A specific date and time in the format `YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss`, for example `2020-09-10 22:30:00` |
| File | A [file]({% link process-automation/latest/model/files.md %}) uploaded into a process definition or as part of a process instance or task |
| JSON | A JSON object, for example `{"flavor" : "caramel"}` |
| Folder | A folder object described as JSON, for example `"name": "mint-folder"` |
| Array | A comma separated list of entries, for example `mint, strawberry, vanilla` that will be formatted to `["mint","strawberry","vanilla"]` |

### Declared variables

Declared variables are used within the script itself and can be set to the value of a script variable by using the prefix `variables.` to reference the script variable. An input variable will set a declared variable to the value of a script variable when the script is executed.

For example, in a process the script variables `cost` and `orders` will have their values set from process variables. The declared variables `costOfItem` and `numberOfOrders` can then be set to these values using the following:

```javascript
let costOfItem = variables.cost;
let numberOfOrders = variables.orders;
```

The value of the script variable `totalCost` will then be set after the script has executed by using the following: 

```javascript
variables.totalCost = costOfItem * numberOfOrders;
```

The value of the script variable `totalCost` can finally be sent back to the process by [mapping it to a process variable]({% link process-automation/latest/model/processes/index.md %}#process-variable-mapping).

## Process scripts

Scripts can be used to start a process instance by building a payload.

For example, use the process definition ID and set the process variables using:

```javascript
let startProcessInstanceCmd = processPayloadBuilder.start()
	.withProcessDefinitionKey("Process_GyW7Ekkw")
	.withVariable("orderNumber": variables.orderNumber)
	.withVariable("quantity": variables.quantity)
	.build();
commandProducer.send(startProcessInstanceCmd);
```

### Content APIs

The following content APIs are supported:

* `ActionService`
* `GroupService`
* `NodeService`
* `PeopleService`
* `QueryService`
* `SearchService`
* `SiteService`
* `TagService`

You can create the object by accessing the API which then allows you to make use of all its methods.

For example:

```javascript
const nodeBodyCreate = { name: variables.name, nodeType: "cm:folder" };
const nodeService = new NodeService();
nodeService.createNode(variables.parentNodeId, nodeBodyCreate);
```
