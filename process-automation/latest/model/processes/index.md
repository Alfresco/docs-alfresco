title: Overview of processes
---

Processes are the collection of components that are used to build and represent business processes using [BPMN 2.0 specification](https://www.omg.org/spec/BPMN/2.0/){:target="_blank"}.

There are three concepts associated with modeling processes to understand and differentiate between:

* **Diagrams** are the container that process definitions are modeled in. A process diagram can contain multiple process definitions when [pools]({% link process-automation/latest/model/processes/bpmn.md %}#pools-and-lanes) are used to separate them. Process diagrams are colour coded with the following definitions:

  * Blue indicates completed nodes
  * Green indicates current active nodes
  * Red indicates failed nodes

* **Process definitions** are the templates that a process follows, made up of BPMN elements and sequence flows. A process definition describes the business logic that will be followed repeatedly at runtime.

* **Process instances** are specific running instances of a process definition. Each process instance will have a unique process instance ID but they can share the same process definition ID indicating which process definition was used to start the process instance. There can be any number of process instances running using the same process definition in an N:1 relationship.

## Create a process

To create a process:

1. Sign into the Modeling Application and open a project.

2. Click the **NEW** dropdown.

3. Select how to create the process:

    * **Create > Process** creates a new, empty diagram and process definition.

    * **Upload > Process** allows for uploading an existing diagram `.bpmn20.xml` file into the Modeling Application.

    Alternatively use the **+** or **Upload** buttons next to **Processes** in the left-hand menu.

4. Enter a name and optional description. By default the name will be shared between the diagram and process definition and the description will apply to the process definition.

### Import a process from Process Services

Process diagrams exported from [Alfresco Process Services]({% link process-services/latest/index.md %}) can be imported into the Modeling Application by selecting the **APS Process** option when choosing to [create a new process](#create-a-process) by importing an existing model.

The Process Service element types that are supported for import are:

| Process Services type | Process Automation type | Notes |
| --------------------- | ----------------------- | ----- |
| Script task | [Script task]({% link process-automation/latest/model/processes/bpmn.md %}#script-task) | A script and a script task will be created for each script. {::nomarkdown}<ul><li>Only Javascript is supported.</li><li>Multi-instance is not supported.</li><li>Execution listeners removed.</li><li> Asynchronous option removed.</li><li>Exclusive option removed.</li><li>Is for compensation option removed.</li><li>A script task is created as a service task in Process Automation.</ul>{:/} |
| User task | [User task]({% link process-automation/latest/model/processes/bpmn.md %}#user-task) | A user task will be created for each user task. {::nomarkdown}<ul><li>Forms are not supported.</li><li>Date format is a fixed date.</li><li>Due date is not supported.</li><li><code>Initiator</code> is set as the assignee in Process Automation.</li><li>Category option removed.</li><li>Exclusive option removed.</li><li>Allow email notifications option removed.</li><li>Email template option removed.</li><li>Task and execution listeners removed.</li><li>Asynchronous option removed.</li></ul>{:/} |

## Diagrams

Diagrams hold one or more process definitions. If multiple process definitions are modeled within a diagram it is important to remember that the scope of each is restricted and the only way to communicate between them is via [message](#message) or [error](#error) events.

### Diagram properties

The properties for a diagram are:

| Property | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| ID | *Required.* The unique identifier for a diagram. This is system generated and cannot be altered, for example `model-1bf32338-2bc2-4af2-9496-e9a031e22142` |
| Diagram name | *Required.* The name of the diagram. Diagram names must be in lowercase and between 1 and 26 characters in length. Alphanumeric characters and hyphens are allowed, however the name must begin with a letter and end alphanumerically, for example `requests-and-orders`. |

### Diagram XML

The ID and name of a diagram are set as XML attributes of the `definitions` element, for example:

```xml
<bpmn2:definitions id="model-1bf32338-2bc2-4af2-9496-e9a031e22142" name="requests-and-orders">
```

## Process definitions

Process definitions are designed using [BPMN elements]({% link process-automation/latest/model/processes/bpmn.md %}) which in turn can reference other modeled components within a project such as forms, connectors and decision tables.

A process definition is created when a diagram is created and it will share the same name as the diagram. Use the BPMN element [pools]({% link process-automation/latest/model/processes/bpmn.md %}#pools-and-lanes) to create separate process definitions within a diagram.

### Process definition properties

The properties for a process definition are:

| Property | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| Process ID | *Required.* The unique identifier for a process definition. This is system generated and cannot be altered, for example `Process_1w18m9x`. |
| Process definition name | *Required.* The name of the process definition. Process definition names must be in lowercase and between 1 and 26 characters in length. Alphanumeric characters and hyphens are allowed, however the name must begin with a letter and end alphanumerically, for example `request-process` |
| Executable | *Required.* If set as `false` then the process definition will be deployed at runtime but it will not be possible to create any process instances using it. The default value is `true`. |
| Documentation | *Optional.* A free text description of what the process definition does, for example `A process to request stock orders`. |

### Process definition XML

The ID, name and executable status of a process definition are set as XML attributes of the `process` element. Documentation is a sub-element of `process`, for example:

```xml
<bpmn2:process id="Process_1w18m9x" name="request-process" isExecutable="false">
        <bpmn2:documentation>A process to request stock orders</bpmn2:documentation>
```

## Process modeling

The Modeling Application contains three tabs for creating and editing processes.

### Diagram Editor

The **Diagram Editor** is the GUI for modeling processes by dragging and dropping items from the palette. The palette contains the [BPMN elements]({% link process-automation/latest/model/processes/bpmn.md %}) that can be used to model a process and import other models created in the Modeling Application into a process. The palette also contains four tools for editing items on the canvas:

| Tool | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| Hand | Use the hand tool to pan around the diagram and select elements to view their properties. |
| Global connect | Use the global connect tool to draw [sequence flows]({% link process-automation/latest/model/processes/bpmn.md %}#sequence-flow) between elements on the diagram. |
| Create/remove space | Use the create/remove space tool to move elements around the diagram. |
| Lasso | Use the lasso tool to drag a box and select multiple elements on the diagram. |

### XML Editor

The **XML Editor** contains the XML for the process diagram. Changes made in the **Diagram Editor** or in the **XML Editor** are reflected in the other. When importing or downloading a process the `.bpmn20.xml` file will reflect what is in the **XML Editor**.

XML excerpts are provided as examples with each [BPMN element]({% link process-automation/latest/model/processes/bpmn.md %}).

### Extensions Editor

The **Extensions Editor** is a JSON editor that stores any extensions made for process definitions. When a diagram contains more than one process definition, there will be an entry for each in the **Extensions Editor**. Extensions are broken down into four areas:

| Extension type | Description |
| -------------- | ----------- |
| constants | Constants are values that will not change for the duration of a process such as the service task implementation of a decision table. |
| mappings | Mappings are the record of how variables are passed between the process and other models and BPMN elements such as user tasks, decision tables and scripts.  |
| properties | Properties store the details of process variables. |
| assignments | Assignments store the user and group assignations for [user tasks]({% link process-automation/latest/model/processes/bpmn.md %}#user-task). |

## Process variables

Process variables are used to store values and pass them between BPMN elements throughout a process instance. For example, values entered into a form as part of a user task can be sent to process variables in the process, which in turn can send those values to a decision table to evaluate and choose the direction the process should take.

The scope of process variables is restricted to a process definition and not to the diagram it is created in, which is important to consider when using multiple [pools]({% link process-automation/latest/model/processes/bpmn.md %}#pools-and-lanes).

### Process variable properties

The properties for a process variable are:  

| Property | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| name | A unique name that can contain alphanumeric characters and underscores but must begin with a letter, for example `var_3` |
| type | A data type selected from a dropdown. See the following table for a list of data types, for example `String` |
| required | Sets whether the process variable must contain a value when a process instance is started, for example `false` |
| value | An optional default value for the process variable, for example `ice-cream` |

> **Note**: There are four process variable names that are created automatically and should not be used as custom process variable names. `nrOfInstances`, `nrOfActiveInstances`, `nrOfCompletedInstances` and `loopCounter` are used by [multi-instance elements]({% link process-automation/latest/model/processes/bpmn.md %}).

The data types that a process variable can be set as are:

| Type | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| String | A sequence of characters, for example `#Mint-Ice-Cream-4!`. |
| Integer | A positive whole number, for example `642`. |
| Boolean | A value of either `true` or `false`. |
| Date | A specific date in the format `YYYY-MM-DD`, for example `2020-04-22`. You can also select `Today` from the Value column, which will take the form `${now()}` in the Expression column. |
| Datetime | A specific date and time in the format `YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss`, for example `2020-09-10 22:30:00`. |
| File | A [file]({% link process-automation/latest/model/files.md %}) uploaded into a process definition or as part of a process instance or task. |
| JSON | A JSON object, for example `{"flavor" : "caramel"}`. |
| Folder | A folder object described as JSON, for example `"name": "mint-folder"`. |
| Array | A comma separated list of entries, for example `mint, strawberry, vanilla` that will be formatted to `["mint","strawberry","vanilla"]`. |

### Create a process variable

To create a process variable:

1. Select the project and process to create a process variable for in the Modeling Application.

2. Select **Edit Process Variables** against the correct process definition:

    * If the diagram contains only one process definition, make sure no BPMN element is selected by clicking on a blank section of the canvas and the **Edit Process Variables** button will be visible in the right-hand properties panel.
    * If the diagram contains more than one process definition then click on the individual [pools]({% link process-automation/latest/model/processes/bpmn.md %}#pools-and-lanes) to view the **Edit Process Variables** button for each definition.

3. Use the **+** symbol to add new variables and enter a name, type, optional value and select whether it is required or not.

> **Note**: The details of any process variables can be viewed in the properties section of the [extensions editor](#extensions-editor), for example:

```json
{
    "properties": {
        "17aa41f7-9a0c-49c0-805b-045243f8a7e5": {
            "id": "17aa41f7-9a0c-49c0-805b-045243f8a7e5",
            "name": "firstName",
            "type": "string",
            "required": false,
        },
```

### Process variable mapping

**Mapping** is a property of BPMN elements such as [user tasks]({% link process-automation/latest/model/processes/bpmn.md %}#user-task), [service tasks]({% link process-automation/latest/model/processes/bpmn.md %}#service-task) and [script tasks]({% link process-automation/latest/model/processes/bpmn.md %}#script-task). It describes how data should be passed between a process and models such as forms, connectors, and scripts in a process. The data can be passed to variables within those models, such as form variables and script variables or other values in the model such as form fields, connector inputs and outputs and decision table inputs and outputs. Mapping this data is split between input mappings and output mappings:

* Input mapping sets how and which data is sent from process variables to another model within the process.

* Output mapping sets how and which data is sent from models within the process back to process variables.

There are five options for setting the **Mapping** behavior:

{% capture none %}

**Don't map variables** is the default behavior.

When variables are not mapped, there is no transfer of data between process variables and other models within the process.

For example, if **Don't map variables** is selected for a user task in a process then none of the form fields will be populated with values from earlier within the process instance. Similarly, when the form is completed none of the values entered by the user can be reused later in the process, such as within a decision table.

{% endcapture %}
{% capture map %}

**Map variables** allows each input and output to be explicitly mapped between process variables and the values or variables within another model.

If **Map variables** is selected as the **Mapping** type, there are three ways of mapping variables that can be chosen by selecting the edit icon next to any input or output parameters:

* **Process Variables** are regular process variables that must match the type of the source or target parameter. For example an input parameter of type `string` cannot map to a process variable of type `file`.

* **Expressions**: Expressions can be entered using a JSON editor to create more complex mappings such as mapping JSON process variables to input and output parameters. For example, using `${temperature.celsius}` will use the value for the object `celsius`.

	In the following example this would result in a value of `16`:

	```json
	{
  	"day": "Monday",
  	"temperature": {
    	"celsius": 16,
    	"fahrenheit": 66
  		}
	}
	```

* Static **Values** can be entered rather than using process variables.

An example of using the **Map variables** option is a decision table that contains the input `Price` and the output `Decision` and the process contains the process variables `Total` and `customerResponse` the mapping can be configured like the following:

![Map variables example image]({% link process-automation/images/map-variables.png %}){:height="300px" width="190px"}

At runtime, the value for the process variable `Total` will be sent as the input to the decision table when that point in the process instance is reached. Once the decision table has evaluated the input, the value of the output `Decision` will be sent back to the process variable `customerResponse` which can then be used later in the process, such as in sending an email to a customer.

{% endcapture %}
{% capture inputs %}

**Map all input variables** will automatically map the values of process variables to values or variables within a model if their names are identical. Outputs are not mapped at all, so there will be no transfer of data from the model, back to process variables.

For example, if **Map all input variables** is selected for an instance of the email service, process variables named `to`, `subject` and `text` can be used to automatically set the values for the recipient, subject and message in the connector. No output variables are required to be sent back to the process as the execution of the email service is always treated as successful.

{% endcapture %}
{% capture outputs %}

**Map all output variables** will automatically map values or variables from a model to process variables in the process if their names are identical. If there is no process variable with a matching name to one of the outputs of the model it will be created when the model is executed using the name of the output value or variable. Inputs are not mapped at all, so there will be no initial transfer of data from process variables to the other model.

For example, if **Map all output variables** is selected for a start event that contains a form, the data entered to start the process can be used further in the process by mapping the values from fields within the form to process variables in the process. Process variables can be created during modeling time that use the same name as form fields, or alternatively they will be created automatically once the user task is completed at runtime.

{% endcapture %}
{% capture all %}

**Map all variables** will automatically map the values of process variables to values or variables within a model if their names are identical. It will also map values or variables from a model to the process variables in the process if their names are idenitcal. Additionally, for output variables only, if there is no process variable with a matching name to one of the outputs of the model it will be created when the model is executed using the name of the output value or variable.

For example, if **Map all variables** is selected for a user task that contains an `orderStatus` field on the form, a process variable with the name `orderStatus` can be used to set the status of an order automatically when the user task is started. Before the task is completed, a user can update the `orderStatus` field on the form and it will update the same process variable when the task is finished with the new status. Additionally, all the other form fields will be created as process variables when the task is completed.

{% endcapture %}

{% include tabs.html tableid="mapping" opt1="Don't map variables" content1=none opt2="Map variables" content2=map opt3="Map input variables" content3=inputs opt4="Map output variables" content4=outputs opt5="Map all variables" content5=all %}

Any mapping configured in a process is stored in the **Extensions Editor** using the ID of the BPMN element. If not sending any variables then the ID of the element will not appear in the mappings section. The following is an example of explicitly mapping variables:

```json
"mappings": {
    "Task_1f1wpht": {
    	"inputs": {
    		"flavor": {
    			"type": "variable",
    			"value": "choice"
    			},
    		"price": {
    			"type": "value",
    			"value": "${lookUp.price}"
    			},
    		"Limit": {
    			"type": "value",
    			"value": 200
    			}
    		}
    	}
    },
}
```

## Errors

Errors are used by error catching events and error throwing events to model business exceptions using [BPMN elements]({% link process-automation/latest/model/processes/bpmn.md %}). They can be created and managed at the individual error event level, or at a diagram level. Unlike process variables, errors can be shared between process definitions in the same diagram.

To manage all errors in a diagram:

* Make sure no BPMN element is selected by clicking on a blank section of the canvas and the **Edit Errors** button will be visible in the right-hand properties panel.

* If the diagram contains more than one process definition then clicking on the individual [pools]({% link process-automation/latest/model/processes/bpmn.md %}#pools-and-lanes) will also show the **Edit Errors** button.

## Messages

Messages are used by message catching events and message throwing events to send a message and optional payload between [BPMN elements]({% link process-automation/latest/model/processes/bpmn.md %}). They can be created and managed at the individual message event level, or at a diagram level. Unlike process variables, messages can be shared between process definitions in the same diagram.

To manage all messages in a diagram:

* Make sure no BPMN element is selected by clicking on a blank section of the canvas and the **Edit Messages** button will be visible in the right-hand properties panel.

* If the diagram contains more than one process definition then clicking on the individual [pools]({% link process-automation/latest/model/processes/bpmn.md %}#pools-and-lanes) will also show the **Edit Messages** button.

## Actions

The actions that can be run against a process are:

| Action | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
