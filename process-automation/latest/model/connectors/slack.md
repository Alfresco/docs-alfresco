title: Slack connector
---

The Slack connector is used to integrate with the [Slack](https://slack.com){:target="_blank"} web API and REST time messaging API to create Slack channels and send messages to channels or users. 

The Slack connector is displayed on the process diagram with the Slack logo.

The actions that can be executed using the Slack connector are:

* [Send a message](#send-message) to a specific user or channel (public or private)
* [Create a new channel](#create-channel) (public or private)

## Send message

The **SEND_MESSAGE** action is used by the Slack connector to send a message to a user or channel.

The input parameters to send a message in Slack are:

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --------- | ---- | ----------- |
| channelId | String | *Requires one.* The channel ID to send the message to. |
| channelName | String | *Requires one.* The name of the channel to send the message to. |
| userId | String | *Requires one.* The user ID of the message recipient. |
| userEmail | String | *Requires one.* The email address of the message recipient. |
| text | String | *Required.* The contents of the message. The message supports [Freemarker](https://freemarker.apache.org/docs/dgui_datamodel_basics.html){:target="_blank"} syntax, for example `${fullName.lastName}` can be used from the `metadata` parameter to include variables. |
| metadata | JSON | *Optional.* Metadata to be used by the `text` parameter to include [process variables]({% link process-automation/latest/model/processes/index.md %}#process-variables) in a message. |
| requestResponse | String | *Optional.* Set to `no` and a response will be sent back to the process immediately after the message is sent. Set to `any` and a response will be sent back to the process only after a reply is received in the same channel. Set to `thread` and a response will be sent back to the process only after a reply is received in a thread. |

The output parameters from sending a message in Slack are:

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --------- | ---- | ----------- |
| message | String | *Optional.* The message received in the channel or thread if the input parameter `requestResponse` was set to `any` or `thread`. |

## Create channel

The **CREATE_CHANNEL** action is used by the Slack connector to create a new public or private channel in Slack.

The input parameters to create a channel in Slack are:

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --------- | ---- | ----------- |
| channelName | String | *Required.* The name of the channel to be created. |
| channelType | String | *Required.* Set whether the channel is `public` or `private`. |

The output parameters from creating a channel in Slack are:

## Configuration

The Slack connector requires a Slack application and a Slack bot in order to function. The application and bot need to be configured correctly.
