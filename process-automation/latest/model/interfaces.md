title: User interfaces
---

The user interfaces (UI) section sets an end user interface for users to interact with content, tasks, and processes for the project using [Alfresco Digital Workspace]({% link process-automation/latest/using/index.md %}).

## Properties

The basic properties of a UI are:

| Property | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| UI name | *Required.* The name of the interface. Must be in lowercase and between 1 and 26 characters in length. Alphanumeric characters and hyphens are allowed, however the name must begin with a letter and end alphanumerically, for example `order-template`. |
| Content and Process | *Required.* Select **Content** to force all the widgets in the Digital Workspace that refer to content, processes, and tasks to be displayed. Select **Process** when you want only the widgets that refer to processes, and tasks to be displayed. Additionally if **Process** is selected then the landing page can be configured that allows the user who runs the application to be redirected to the list of running processes, or to their list of My Tasks. |
| UI description | *Optional.* A description of what the interface should be used for, for example `A template for orders to follow.` |
| Default System Logo | *Optional.* The default system logo image. The recommended size for the logo is 28x28 px. **Note:** To set a new logo the file must be uploaded in advance with the visibility flag set to public, for more see [Files]({% link process-automation/latest/model/files.md %}). |
| Application title | *Optional.* The name of the application. This is the name that will appear in the header and on the tab of your browser. |
| Header text color HEX code | *Optional.* The color of the header text on the user interface using hexadecimal numbers. For example `#b39eba`. |
| Header color HEX code | *Optional.* The color of the header background on the user interface using hexadecimal numbers. For example `#b39oba`. |
| Default Background Header Image | *Optional.* The default background header image.  **Note:** To set a new background image the file must be uploaded in advance with the visibility flag set to public, for more see [Files]({% link process-automation/latest/model/files.md %}). |

## Create default UI

To create a default UI:

1. Sign in to the Modeling Application and open a project.

2. Click the three dots next to **UI** and then select **Create Default UI**.

3. Enter a name and optional description.

4. Click **Create UI**.  

## Upload default UI

The UI definition is normally created using the [create default UI tool](#create-default-ui) and downloaded as a JSON file by clicking **Download UI**. You can follow the steps in this section to reuse a default UI definition in another project or UI.

> **Note**: To upload a custom UI, follow the steps in [Create custom UI](#create-custom-ui) instead.

To upload a default UI definition:

1. Sign in to the Modeling Application and open a project.

2. Click the three dots next to **UI** and then select **Upload**.

3. Select the JSON file that contains the UI definition.

## Create custom UI

You can create a custom UI outside of the Modeling Application. The custom UI can be an Application Development Framework (ADF) application. It can also be any single page application, such as React or Vanilla HTML, CSS, or JavaScript, that conforms to the UI schema. To verify this, upload your JSON definition and click the **Validate UI** button.

> **Important:** Before uploading your custom UI, ensure that it has a valid application entry point in either an `index.html` or `index.htm` file. The custom UI must be contained in a zip archive with the `index.html` or `index.htm` file at its root. The archive size cannot exceed 50 mb.

> **Note**: ADF comes with a JavaScript library for managing bearer token authentication handling and renewal, which solution builders using other Custom UI implementations will have to manage.

To create a custom UI:

1. Sign in to the Modeling Application and open a project.

2. Click the three dots next to **UI** and then select **Create custom UI**.

3. Enter a name and optional description.

4. If you do not have a customized zip file yet, select **Generate from Template** to generate a custom UI from a UI template, which contains the source code from the Workspace application. The template zip file can be then downloaded and customized in a different application.

5. Once you have a zip file with custom UI, click the **Upload** button and select the zip file that contains your Custom UI.

## Theme

You can add a theme to the Digital Workspace.

### Use the Modeling Application to change the theme

To change the theme using the **UI** properties in the Modeling Application.  

1. Sign in to the Modeling Application.

2. Select the **UI** you want to change and enter the new configuration properties under the **Theme** heading.

    > **Note:** You can only change the **Theme** of the **Default UI**.

3. Save the **UI**.

The properties of the UI theme are:

> **Note:** See example image below.

| Property | Description |
| ----------- |----------- |
| Primary color | The color is used to highlight important parts of your application, for example the text for the selected link in the left pane. |
| Accent color | The color is used to accent highlight areas of your UI and make parts of it stand out more, for example it can be used for floating action buttons, selection controls such as sliders and switches, highlighting selected text or Progress bars, and some links. |
| Text color | The default text color used for the application. |
| Background color | The color of the background, for example the color of the background of the left pane. |
| Font size | The base font size in pixels. Other font sizes are calculated depending on the base size|
| Font family | The family the font belongs to, for example Cursive. |
| Web font URL | Where the specific information about the font used is gathered from, for [example](https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Inspiration&display=swap){:target="_blank"}.  |

### Deploy the theme

If you are deploying using the Modeling Application or Docker compose you must provide the correct configuration and the theme will be generated at startup.
After updating the properties for the custom theme in the Modeling Application, new entries for the **UI** are added to this file: `"customCssPath": "./assets/theme/custom.css" (i.e. /[app-name]/ui/[ui-name]/assets/theme/custom.css)`

For example:

```javascript
"theme": {
   "primaryColor": "#d92ea8",
   "accentColor": "#2eb7d9",
   "textColor": "#672ed9",
   ```

Once you have deployed your application using the admin app, the values from the the `theme` javascript are used for generating the `custom.css` file. If using Docker compose the `custom.css` file is generated during the Docker startup process. The `custom.css` file is used for altering the application theme and the new theme can be found under the `customCssPath` value.

## User interface modeling

Once a user interface has been created, set the type to `content` to deploy the Digital Workspace with the application. This can be accessed by users once a project has been [deployed]({% link process-automation/latest/admin/release.md %}#deployment) using the format `ui/<name>`, for example `https://alfresco.com/finance-project/ui/content-app`.

> **Note**: An instance of Digital Workspace will be deployed with each application that can only start processes created within that same application. Only users assigned [user access]({% link process-automation/latest/admin/release.md %}#deploy-steps/user) to the application will be able to access the interface.

Custom end user actions can be created for the Digital Workspace. This enables custom options to be added to various menus displayed to users. Rules can be set for the actions to only display on files or folders with specific names, or when an aspect is applied to a node. There are three parts to defining custom actions:

* The [action](#actions) itself that will executed when the option is clicked.
* A list of one or more [rules](#rules) to describe which nodes the action will be displayed on.
* The [feature](#features) the action will be displayed on, for example the header or a context menu.

### Actions

There are four types of end user actions that can be configured:

* [Events](#event) that are used in conjunction with a [trigger]({% link process-automation/latest/model/triggers.md %}) to start a trigger action when clicked by a user.
* [Forms](#form) that display a [form]({% link process-automation/latest/model/forms.md %}) to the user to fill in, independent of a user task or process.
* [Navigation](#navigation) to set a URL to redirect to when clicked by the user.
* [Start process](#start-process) to start a named process when clicked by the user, and optionally include the file the action was launched from when clicked.

#### Event

Event actions are directly referenced by [triggers]({% link process-automation/latest/model/triggers.md %}) when they are clicked. This means that an action can post a predefined message to a Slack channel or send an email notifying an email group about the document.

> **Note:** If a [user interface trigger action]({% link process-automation/latest/model/triggers.md %}#user-interface) is not created that references the event action then nothing will happen when the action is clicked by an end user.

The properties of an event action are:

| Property | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| Name | *Required.* The name of the action. **Note:** This is not the text that will appear to the end user in a menu. |
| Type | *Required.* The type of action will be `Event`. |
| Use selected nodes in action | *Optional.* Sets whether the nodes selected when the action is clicked can be used in the event or not, for example `true`. |

#### Form

Form actions open a [form]({% link process-automation/latest/model/forms.md %}) in Digital Workspace that users can fill in when the action is clicked. The form in question can be completely independent of a process and user task. Forms allow users to enter some information and use the output, for example to use a [trigger]({% link process-automation/latest/model/triggers.md %}#forms) on the form submission event.

The properties of a form action are:

| Property | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| Name | *Required.* The name of the action. **Note:** This is not the text that will appear to the end user in a menu. |
| Type | *Required.* The type of action will be `Form`. |
| Form | *Required.* The name of the form to display when the action is clicked. |
| Use selected nodes in action | *Optional.* Sets whether the nodes selected when the action is clicked can be used in the form or not, for example `true`. |

#### Navigation

Navigation actions open a link when they are clicked by an end user. The link can be relative, for example opening another document from the repository, or the link can be absolute, such as to open another application.

The properties of a navigation action are:

| Property | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| Name | *Required.* The name of the action. **Note:** This is not the text that will appear to the end user in a menu. |
| Type | *Required.* The type of action will be `Navigation`. |
| Target | *Required.* The absolute or relative link the action will direct to, for example `https://wikipedia.org`. |
| Open in new tab | *Optional.* Sets whether the link opens in a new tab or not, for example `false`. |
| Use selected nodes in action | *Optional.* Sets whether the nodes selected when the action is clicked can be used in the navigation URL or not, for example `true`. |

> **Note:** The `Target` can use the variable `${nodes}` if `Use selected nodes in action` is set to `true` to pass the node ID to the link, for example `personal-files/(viewer:view/${nodes})?location=%2Fpersonal-files`.

#### Start process

A start process action will start a process when the action is clicked. If the selected process contains a form on the [start event]({% link process-automation/latest/model/processes/bpmn.md %}#start-events) with an [attach file field]({% link process-automation/latest/model/forms.md %}#attach-file-fields) and `Use selected nodes in action` is set to `true`, then the file that was selected when the action was clicked will be attached to it automatically.

The properties of a start process action are:

| Property | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| Name | *Required.* The name of the action. **Note:** This is not the text that will appear to the end user in a menu. |
| Type | *Required.* The type of action will be `Start process`. |
| Process | *Required.* The name of the process to start when the action is clicked. |
| Use selected nodes in action | *Optional.* Sets whether the nodes selected when the action is clicked can be used in the process or not, for example `true`. |

### Rules

Rules are used to define when an action is displayed to the end user. This is achieved using a series of evaluators, operators and optional nested groups.

Rule groups must:

* All be met for the action to display using **Every**.
* At least one met for the action to display using **Some**.
* Must not be met for the action to display using **Not**.

> **Note:** Individual evaluators in a rule can be set to evaluate negatively using the `!` against them. For example, if the evaluator `app.navigation.isTrashCan` is set to evaluate negatively then the user must *not* be in the trashcan for the action to appear.

Some evaluators take additional operators such as `contains`, `equals` or `matches`. For example, the evaluator `selection.currentFolder.name` can use a fully qualified folder name such as `Invoices` or use a regular expression such as `^(I|i)nvoices`.

#### Application evaluators

Application evaluators check a user's permissions on files and folders to set whether action will be displayed.

The application evaluators are:
