title: Using Process Automation
---

The default user interface for managing content, processes and tasks is the [Alfresco Digital Workspace]({% link digital-workspace/latest/index.md %}). An instance of Digital Workspace is deployed with every application and used to manage the processes associated with that application.

Users need to have been given [user access]({% link process-automation/latest/admin/release.md %}#deploy-steps/user) to an application in order to access and manage content and processes in the Digital Workspace.

> **Note**: The Digital Workspace can be [extended]({% link process-automation/latest/develop/index.md %}#extend-the-digital-workspace) or replaced with a [custom interface]({% link process-automation/latest/develop/index.md %}#develop-a-custom-user-interface) built using the Application Development Framework.

## Processes

The **Processes** section is used for monitoring all the process instances in the application. The three default views are:

* **Running** which displays all in-flight process instances.
* **Completed** which displays all process instances that have been completed.
* **All** which displays all in-flight, completed, cancelled and suspended process instances.

### Properties {#process-properties}

The properties for each process instance are:

| Property | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| Name | The name given to the process instance when it was started. |
| Process Definition Name | The [process definition]({% link process-automation/latest/model/processes/index.md %}) the instance is using. |
| Status | The current status of the process instance. See the table below for a list of possible statuses. |
| Start Date | The time since the process instance was started. |
| Completed Date | The time since the process instance was completed. It will be blank if the process instance has not yet been completed. |
| Started By | The name of the user that started the process instance. |

> **Note**: Further details are available to view for each process instance by clicking on it. A properties panel will appear on the right-hand side of the screen.

The status of process instances are:

| Status | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| RUNNING | The process instance is currently running. |
| COMPLETED | The process instance has been completed. |
| SUSPENDED | The process instance is currently suspended and cannot continue until it is reactivated. |
| CANCELLED | The process instance has been cancelled and cannot be completed. |

### Start a process instance

To start a process instance:

1. Sign into the Digital Workspace.

2. Click the **NEW** dropdown.

3. Select **Start Process**.

4. Choose the process definition to use from the dropdown and give the process instance a name.

5. Click **Start Process**.

### Start a process instance from a file

Process instances can also be started from a file in the repository. If the process definition contains a [start event]({% link process-automation/latest/model/processes/bpmn.md %}#start-event) that contains a form with an [attach file field]({% link process-automation/latest/model/forms.md %}#attach-file-fields) then the content will be attached to the process as it is started.

1. Sign into the Digital Workspace.

2. Navigate to, or search for the file to start the process with.

3. Right click on the file and select **Start Process**.

4. Select the process definition to use from the dropdown. If the definition does not contain an upload field then a notice is displayed.

5. Give the process instance a name and click **Start Process**.

### Filter process instances

The default process instance views can be updated by changing the filters. New views can also be created by editing the filters for a view and selecting saving a new one.

The properties for filters are:

| Property | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| Process Name | The name of the process instances to display. |
| Process Definition | The process definition to filter by. |
| Status | The statuses of process instances to display. |
| Sort by | The column to sort by, for example `Process Name`, `Status` or `Initiator`. |
| Order by | Whether the ordering is ascending or descending. |
| Completed Date | The date range for when the process instances were completed. |
| Started Date | The date range for when the process instances were started. |

Once you have customized a filter, there are two options:

* **Save filter**: Selecting this will save the filter over the current view.
* **Save filter as**: Selecting this will give you the option to provide a name for a new view for your filter and add it under the **Processes** section.

You can use the **Delete filter** option at any time to remove a view.

## Tasks

The **Tasks** section is used for monitoring all the tasks in the application. The three default views are:

* **My Tasks** which displays all tasks assigned to the user.
* **Queued Tasks** which displays all unclaimed tasks the user is eligible to claim.
* **Completed Tasks** which displays all tasks completed by the user.

In the Digital Workspace you are notified of new tasks assigned to you next to **My Tasks** and **Queued Tasks**. The number within the indicator displays how many tasks of that type you have been assigned. If at least one task has not been seen yet the indicator will be orange. The number within the task counter will continue to display until the tasks are completed.

### Properties {#task-properties}

The properties for each process instance are:

| Property | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| Name | The name of the task. |
| Status | The current status of the task. See the table below for a list of possible statuses. |
| Assignee | The user assigned to the task. It will be blank if the task is unclaimed. |
| Status | The current status of the task. See the table below for a list of possible statuses. |
| Created Date | The time since the task was started. |
| Last Modified | The time since the task was last updated. |
| Due Date | The date and time the task is due to be completed by. |
| Priority | The relative priority of the task. |

> **Note**: Further details are available to view for each task by clicking on it. A properties panel will appear on the right-hand side of the screen.

The status of tasks are:

| Status | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| CREATED | The task has been created but not yet assigned. |
| ASSIGNED | The task has assigned but not yet completed. |
| COMPLETED | The task has been completed. |
| SUSPENDED | The task is suspended because the process instance it belongs to has been suspended. It cannot be completed until the process instance is activated. |
| CANCELLED | The task has been cancelled and cannot be completed. |

### Claim and release tasks

Tasks that are assigned to a [candidate group]({% link process-automation/latest/model/processes/bpmn.md %}#user) can be claimed by an individual user to work on the task. Claiming a task will remove it from other candidates **Queued Tasks** list.

To claim a task:

1. Sign into the Digital Workspace.

2. Click on the **Queued Tasks** view under **Tasks**.

3. Click on the task to claim and select **Claim**. The task status will update to `ASSIGNED`.

Tasks that have been claimed from a candidate group can also be released. This will remove it from your **My Tasks** list and put it back in **Queued Tasks**.

To release a task:

1. Sign into the Digital Workspace.

2. Click on the **My Tasks** view under **Tasks**.

3. Click on the task to release and select **Release**. The task status will update to `CREATED`.

### Filter tasks

The default task views can be updated by changing the filters. New views can also be created by editing the filters for a view and selecting saving a new one.

The properties for filters are:

| Property | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| Status | The statuses of tasks to display. |
| Assignee | The tasks assigned to which user to display. |
| Process Definition | The process definition to filter by. |
| Task Name | The name of the tasks to display. |
| Priority | The relative priority level of tasks to display. |
| Sort by | The column to sort by, for example `Created Date`, `Status` or `Priority`. |
| Order by | Whether the ordering is ascending or descending. |
| Due Date | The date range for when the tasks are due by. |
| Completed Date | The date range for when the tasks were completed. |

Once you have customized a filter, there are two options:

* **Save filter**: Selecting this will save the filter over the current view.
* **Save filter as**: Selecting this will give you the option to provide a name for a new view for your filter and add it under the **Tasks** section.

You can use the **Delete filter** option at any time to remove a view.

## Condition builder

The condition builder is a tool that helps you build a JUEL expression for a condition. The condition is composed of a set of boolean statement(s) that are linked by an operator. This means the condition to be created is a statement evaluated as a boolean value. The following is an example.

![Condition builder]({% link process-automation/images/condition-builder.png %})

* Click the **$** button to switch the condition builder to an expression editor where you can display and edit the JUEL expression.

* Click the **+** button to add a new statement editor.

* The available operators are:
  * **Every**: All statements must be true for the condition to be evaluated as true.
  * **At least one**: The condition will be evaluated to be true when one or more of the statements are true.
  * **None**: If all the statements are false, then the condition will be evaluated to be true.
  
  > **Note:** The operator between statements is the same for all the statements.

* Click the **-** button to remove the statement.

### Statement editor

The statement editor manages boolean statements. A boolean statement normally consists of two statements and an operator between them, for example `<left-statement> <operator> <right-statement>`.

The statement editor reproduces the structure, the following is an example.

![Statement editor]({% link process-automation/images/statement-editor.png %})

#### Left statement

The left-statement can be one of the available variables or a JUEL expression. Switching between variable and JUEL expression can be done using the tabs at the top of the left side.
The available operators between statements are:

* Equals
* Not equals
* Greater than
* Greater or equals than
* Less than
* Less or equals than
* Not set

> **Note:** The `Not set` operator means that the expression is a single statement expression which means no right-statement is needed.

#### Right statement

The right-statement can be one of the available variables, a JUEL expression, or a value if the left-statement is a variable value.

## Expression editor

The expression editor is a code editor that provides autocompletion and hints when writing an expression that may contain a JUEL expression.
The expression editor appears in the following places:

* Task mapping dialog: when selecting an expression as a variable value
* Variable dropdown selector: when using the dollar button
* User task assignment dialog
* Called element dialog: when using an expression to resolve the called element
* In the email template dialog: when setting the template for the email used in user tasks
* In the condition builder
* When setting the value of a JSON variable

Click the green button to expand the modal dialog to be full size, the following is an example.

> **Note:** The green button only displays if the expression editor has been configured for it to show.

![Expression editor]({% link process-automation/images/expression-editor.png %})

### Autocompletion

The autocompletion function is based on the context of the project and depends on where the expression is going to be used. It lets the user know which variables in that context are available. The autocompletion is displayed as the user types but can also be triggered by using the following keyboard shortcuts:

* In Windows or Linux: `Ctrl + Space`
* In MacOS: `Cmd + Space`

The following is an example.

![Auto completion]({% link process-automation/images/auto-completion.png %})

Autocompletion displays suggestions for operators, in the example `empty` and `eq`, and for variables `event` in the screenshot.

Autocompletion can also show method suggestions and attributes when using the ‘dot’ accessor, in the example below `equals` and `hashcode` are methods while `data` and `datacontenttype` are attributes of the `event` object.

![Event]({% link process-automation/images/event.png %})

### Hints

The expression editor provides helpful information when you place the cursor over an element of it. For example, in the image the cursor has been placed over the word `event` and a hint is displayed that provides a description of the `event` variable.

![Hints]({% link process-automation/images/hints.png %})
