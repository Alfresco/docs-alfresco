# Search options in the Alfresco sidebar

Search the repository using the Alfresco sidebar.

1.  Go to the **Alfresco Client** tab on the Outlook toolbar and click **Show Sidebar**.

    This option displays a new window on the right side of the screen, called Alfresco Outlook Client.

2.  Click the Search tab from the sidebar.

    1.  Choose the scope and content that you want to search. You can see the repository, all sites, or you can limit the view to a single folder \(Repository, All Sites or Current folder\). You can also choose to view all content, or only your favourite files or folders.

        Your selection is repeated below the search box, for example, if the scope is set to Repository, the text below the search box reads Searching in Repository.

    2.  Enter your search criteria.

        For a simple search, type directly in the search box, where it says Enter your search. For an advanced search, click ![Outlook Client Advanced Search icon](../images/outlook-search_v2.png) and enter your chosen criteria.

        The simple search automatically searches the names, titles, descriptions, content and tags of the stored files and emails. The search works in the same way as the search in Alfresco. The advanced search offers the option to search within file names, email contents and subject lines as well as specific timeframes.

    3.  You can view the files, folders, and sites that match your criteria in the three tabs below the search box.

    4.  There are a number of actions to apply for each search result:

        -   ![Outlook Client favorite icon](../images/outlook-search-favorite.png) Mark as a favorite
        -   ![Outlook Client email link icon](../images/outlook-search-email-link.png) Send an email, with this result embedded as a link
        -   ![Outlook Client sync icon](../images/outlook-search-sync.png) Find this result in the repository \(result is shown in the Explore tab\)
        -   ![Outlook Client email attachment icon](../images/outlook-search-attach-email.png) Send an email, with this result attached \(applicable to files only\)
