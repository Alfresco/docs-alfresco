# Configuring email archive settings in Outlook

You can configure Microsoft Outlook to archive email in Alfresco, including archiving emails as links.

You can decide what format you want to use to save your emails, and how to archive your emails. In the Email Archiving tab, you can take one or more of the following actions:

-   Save the original Outlook MSG file in Alfresco with the original email
-   Save attachments as separate files in Alfresco
-   Save email as a link to the content in Alfresco
-   Use default settings for archiving \(where all emails are saved to the Alfresco server, based on the option selected in Default archive settings\)
-   Show settings when archiving \(to select how each email will be archived\)
-   Compress the email message while uploading the content

You can reduce the size of your Outlook inbox by archiving emails as links to the content in Alfresco:

1.  Select Configure \> Email Archiving from the Alfresco Client tab in Microsoft Outlook.

2.  Click **Replace content with links** in Default archive settings, and your preferred option in Email archive settings.

    **Replace content with links** saves the email \(the original EML file\) in Alfresco and a partial email \(without text and attachments\) in Microsoft Outlook.

    **Note:** When the email is archived, the original complete email exists in Alfresco only. Outlook contains a link to this email. If you click the **Download original email message** link in an archived email, the original email is loaded from Alfresco and can be opened in Outlook.


Outlook emails are archived to the Alfresco server, and can be accessed using links in Microsoft Outlook.
