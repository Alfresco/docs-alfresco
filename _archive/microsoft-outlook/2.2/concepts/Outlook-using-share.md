# Managing archived files in Alfresco

View your archived emails in Alfresco, just like any other files in Alfresco. Email filters allow you to search for the archived emails in a site or across Alfresco.

In the simple Alfresco view, view the properties of each archived email. In the detailed Alfresco view, HTML and rich text emails, and attachments are displayed as a color preview.

In Document Actions, send a link to the email in Alfresco by selecting the **Email as link** option. Also, if a MSG file is saved, open it using the **MSG file** button in the preview. All other options remain available.

Use the advanced Alfresco search to find archived emails by using the option Look for: Emails from the Advanced Search toolbar.
