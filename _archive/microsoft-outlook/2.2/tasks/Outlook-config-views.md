# Configuring views in Outlook

You can configure the look and feel of the Alfresco sidebar.

You can configure which fields are visible in the list view of the Alfresco sidebar.

1.  Select Configure \> Views from the Alfresco Client tab in Microsoft Outlook.

    If your IT team has configured the list view so that you can't edit your settings locally, the buttons on this tab are grayed out.

2.  Check all columns that you want to see in the list view in the sidebar.

    You can also move columns up and down \(for example, if you want to see the name of a file or folder before the modified date, you can move that column name higher. Type is not editable and is always visible. This column is displayed as an icon representing a site, file, or folder.

    If your IT team has assigned an alternative column configuration for a specific site, folder, or content type, you can define different list views for each location.

3.  Click Reset to restore the default column views.

    See [Configuring Outlook metadata and list view settings in Alfresco](Outlook-admin-metadata-settings.md#) for more information.

4.  Click OK to save.
