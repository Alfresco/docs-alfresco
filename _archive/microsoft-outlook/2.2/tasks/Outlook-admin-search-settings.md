# Configuring Outlook search settings in Alfresco

You can configure search settings for Alfresco Outlook Integration using Share Admin Tools. These settings define global controls across your enterprise and are applied immediately.

1.  Open Alfresco Share, and click **Admin Tools** on the toolbar.

2.  Click Email Search Settings then Edit.

    See [Outlook search settings](Outlook-config-search.md) for more detailed guidance on adding search settings.

3.  Paste the XML code that contains the configuration settings for the Alfresco Outlook Client into the **Configuration XML content** field, or load and edit the default configuration template by clicking **Load default configuration template**.

    You can use the default configuration template for testing purposes, and edit this if you prefer.

4.  Click Apply to save.

    If your XML isn't valid, you won't be allowed to save your settings, and you'll see an error message.
