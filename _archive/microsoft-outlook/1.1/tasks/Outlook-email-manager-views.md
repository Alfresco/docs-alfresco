# Viewing options in the Alfresco sidebar

Set preferences, drag and drop, search, start workflows, and use the context menu in the Alfresco sidebar.

1.  In Microsoft Outlook, navigate to the Alfresco sidebar and click the Explore tab: ![Outlook Client repo Explore icon](../images/Alfresco-outlook-explore.png)

    If you can't see the Alfresco sidebar you might not have it configured. See step 4 of [Configuring extended settings in Outlook](Outlook-config-extended.md) for information about displaying the Alfresco sidebar.

    1.  Select filter by All, Favorite documents, Favorite files or Favorites.

        Favourites is a combination of favorite documents and folders.

    2.  Drill down the repository or site to see individual folders and documents.

2.  Click the Search tab: ![Outlook Client repo Search icon](../images/Alfresco-outlook-search.png)

    1.  Use the option lists to select your scope \(Repository, Favorites and so on\).

        The scope is repeated below the search box, for example, if the scope is set to Repository, the text below the search box reads Searching in Repository.

    2.  Enter your search criteria.

        For a simple search, type directly in the search box, where it says Enter your search criteria. For an advanced search, click the ![Outlook Client Advanced Search icon](../images/Outlook-adv-search.png) icon and enter your chosen criteria.

        The simple search automatically searches the names, titles, descriptions, content and tags of the stored documents and emails. The use of a wildcard \(\*\) is not necessary. The search works in the same way as the search in Alfresco Share. The advanced search offers the option to search within file names, email contents and subject lines as well as specific timeframes.

    3.  You can view the results in the three tabs below the search box; by document, by documents and folders, and by email.

        If you hover over the title of an item in the returned search results, a preview of the document is loaded in Outlook.

3.  Click the Workflow tab: ![Outlook Client repo Workflow icon](../images/Alfresco-outlook-wflow.png)

    1.  Use the option list to filter by My initiated workflows or My tasks.

        You can start and view workflows from the Alfresco sidebar, following rules that are set in Alfresco Share.

        Upcoming appointments and tasks are shown in the left pane.
