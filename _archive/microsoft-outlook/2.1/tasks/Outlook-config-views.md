# Configuring views in Outlook

You can configure the look and feel of the Alfresco sidebar.

You can configure which fields are visible in the list view of the Alfresco sidebar.

1.  Select Configure \> Views from the Alfresco Client tab in Microsoft Outlook.

    If your system administrator has configured Alfresco so that you can't edit your settings locally, the buttons on this tab are grayed out.

2.  Check all columns that you want to see in the list view in the Alfresco sidebar.

    You can also move columns up and down \(for example, if you want to see the name of a file or folder before the modified date, you can move that column name higher. Type is not editable and is always visible. This column is displayed as an icon representing a site, file, or folder.

3.  Click Reset to restore the default column views that are specified in the Alfresco configuration.

    See [Configuring Outlook metadata and list view settings in Alfresco](Outlook-admin-metadata-settings.md#) for more information.

4.  Click OK to save.
