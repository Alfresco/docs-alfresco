# Administering Sync Service

This section provides an overview of the Sync Service and describes how to configure it.

-   **[Limiting folder synchronization](../tasks/ds-limit-sync.md)**  
If you're an IT administrator, you can prevent folders being synchronized from the repository to Desktop Sync clients. This allows you to have granular control over the content that your Desktop Sync users can access on their desktops.
-   **[Setting up clustering](../concepts/desktop-sync-clustering.md)**  
There are a number of prerequisites and configuration properties to consider when setting up Sync Service in a clustered environment.
-   **[Monitoring Sync Service](../concepts/desktop-sync-monitor.md)**  
Use this information to manage and monitor various aspects of Sync Service.
-   **[Backing up and restoring Sync Service](../tasks/ds-backup-restore.md)**  
The approach to backup and restore is to ensure that the repository is backed up before the Sync Service, so that a subsequent restore can simply remove any tracked repository changes that occurred after the repository backup.
