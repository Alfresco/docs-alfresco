# Administering Desktop Sync

Alfresco Sync Service is an add-on module that synchronizes files between the desktop and repository using web services. It's part of the Desktop Sync solution that consists of three components: Sync Service, Desktop Sync for Windows, and Desktop Sync for Mac. This documentation describes how to install, configure, and administer the Sync Service.

**Important:** This release of the Sync Service module can be applied to Alfresco One, and Alfresco Content Services. See [Desktop Sync prerequisites](desktop-sync-prerequisites.md) for more.

To learn more about the key components that interact with the Sync Service, see [Desktop Sync overview](desktop-sync-overview.md).
