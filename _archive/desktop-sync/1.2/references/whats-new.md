**Multi-language support**

Desktop Sync now supports 16 languages across the user interface, notifications and right click context menu. The language is automatically set based on your computer locale settings. This can be overridden through the applications configuration file.

Supported languages are: US English \(en\), German \(de\), Spanish \(es\), French \(fr\), Italian \(it\), Japanese \(ja\), Dutch \(nl\), Simplified Chinese \(zh\_CN\), Russian \(ru\), Norwegian Bokm√•l \(nb\), Brazilian Portuguese \(pt\_BR\), Polish \(pl\), Swedish \(sv\), Finnish \(fi\), Danish \(da\) and Czech \(cs\).

See [Configuring Desktop Sync](../concepts/ds-config.md) \(Windows\) and [Configuring Desktop Sync](../concepts/ds-config-mac.md) \(Mac\) for more.

In addition to the user interface multilingual support, the application also synchronizes content from repositories that are installed in non-English languages, with `Alfresco` system folders being created according to the locale of the repository.

**Selective sync improvements**

Selective sync allows you to select only the folders you want to be synced to your computer.

By default, all files and sub-folders of your selected sync targets are saved to your computer. Just like your other folders, this takes up space on your hard drive. As an alternative, you can now unselect specific sub-folders to save space. For example, if you choose to sync a site, you can unselect specific folders that might contain very large files you don't need locally, like a video folder.

We recommend using selective sync for folders you don't need to access often.

See [Selecting content to sync](../tasks/ds-select-sync.md) \(Windows\) and [Selecting content to sync](../tasks/ds-select-sync-mac.md) \(Mac\) for more.
