# **Creating data models for folders**

You can map entities to the Alfresco Content Services repository to create data models for Alfresco Content Services folders.

-   **[Configuring the data source](../tasks/ps-config-data-source.md)**  
Before defining a data model for Alfresco Content Services folders entities, you need to establish a repository connection and register the data source in your tenant.
-   **[Defining folder entity data models](../tasks/ps-define-data-model.md)**  
Once you've configured the data source you can define folder entity data models.

**Parent topic:**[Data Models](../topics/data_models.md)
