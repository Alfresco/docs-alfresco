# **Using folder entities in process applications**

When you've created a folder data model, you can use it in several ways.

-   Create a folder entity in the Alfresco Content Services repository with the folder metadata
-   Update an existing folder entity in the Alfresco Content Services repository using the Store Entity Task
-   Retrieve and display the folder entity and its related metadata in a form

-   **[Creating folder entities](../tasks/ps-create-folder-entity.md)**  
You can create an Alfresco Content Services folder entity in Alfresco Content Services repository with the folder metadata.
-   **[Configuring the folder entity parent](../tasks/ps-config-folder-entity-parent.md)**  
To create a folder entity you need to provide a parent for the entity parent folder. This can be configured in three different ways.
-   **[Updating folder entities](../tasks/ps-update-folder-entity.md)**  
Updating a Alfresco Content Services folder entity is similar to creating one using Store Entity tasks, with different key mapped fields.
-   **[Retrieve and use a folder entity](../tasks/ps-retrieve-and-use.md)**  
As with other data models, there are two ways you can retrieve Alfresco Content Services folder entities and use them in a process or decision table.
