# Sub process Step

A sub process step enables you to create a step that itself contains a sequence of steps that constitute a complete process definition. When saved, this definition is added to the list of substeps available to your main process definition. This gives you a method of managing complex processes by refining repeated sequences of steps into a sub step. This can make your process definition easier to comprehend visually.

The sub step dialog contains one tab that lets you fully define the task.

A sub process lets you choose a sub process that you have already defined in this process definition, or you can create a new sub process that is reusable in this process definition.
