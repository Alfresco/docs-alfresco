# Microsoft Office integration

The Microsoft Office integration \(opening an Office document directly from the browser\) doesnâ€™t need any specific configuration. However, the protocol used for the integration mandates the use of **HTTPS** servers by default. This means that Alfresco Process Services must run on a server that has HTTPS and its certificates are correctly configured.

If this is not possible for some reason, change the setting on the machines for **each** user to make this feature work.

For Windows, see:

For OS X, execute following terminal command:

```
defaults -currentHost write com.microsoft.registrationDB hkey_current_user\\hkey_local_machine\\software\\microsoft\\office\\14.0\\common\\internet\\basicauthlevel -int 2
```

Note that this is not a recommended approach from a security point of view.
