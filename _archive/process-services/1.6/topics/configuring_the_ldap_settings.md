# Configuring the LDAP settings

You can find the LDAP settings for Alfresco Process Services in the activiti-ldap.properties file located here:

```
webapps/activiti-app/WEB-INF/classes/META-INF/activiti-app/activiti-ldap.properties
```

The default configuration works with the sample LDAP settings provided with the installation bundle, however you can easily override them by creating a new file called <InstallLocation\>/lib/activiti-ldap.properties, and override the properties that requires changing.

For further details about configuring LDAP for Alfresco Process Services, see [External Identity Management \(LDAP/Active Directory\)](externalIdentityManagement.md#).
