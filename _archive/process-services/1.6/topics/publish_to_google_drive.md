# Publish to Google Drive

This is similar to the Publish to Alfresco task step, but for Google Drive. \([https://www.google.com/drive/](https://www.google.com/drive/)\).

Note that a Google Drive account doesnâ€™t need to be configured. A popup shows up when you have to select a document/folder and no account is found. This popup will allow you to log in with the Google Drive credentials and use this account thereafter.
