# Share Connector features

The Share Connector has the following features:

-   **Integrated UI** - The Process Services user interface for working with processes and tasks is embedded into the Share user interface exposing processes called *Review Processes*. When selecting people and documents, the native Share components are used.

-   **Review Processes** - This is available from within Share, and includes four processes: *Ad hoc Task*, *Group ad hoc task*, *Review and Approve - Group* and *Review and Approve - Single person*.

-   **Site Specific Processes** - You can change the default process for a site to display a specific process app by adding an aspect included in the Share Connector to the site's *documentLibrary* folder. For detailed steps, see [Changing the default process for a site](changing_the_default_process_for_a_site.md).

-   **My Activiti Tasks** dashlet - Lists new tasks created using the Share Connector. You can filter tasks by: *Active Tasks, Completed Tasks, Tasks Due Today, Tasks Assigned to Me, Unassigned \(Pooled Tasks\), Overdue Tasks*.

-   **Starting processes** - *Start workflow* in the *Document Library*, *Document details page*, and *My Activiti Tasks* creates new external processes instead of the old internal workflows in Share.

-   **Activiti Task list view** - *My Tasks* page lists new external tasks using the Process Services user interface.

-   **Activiti Process list view** - *Processes* page lists new external processes using the Process Services user interface.

-   **Customized Share header** - The Share header menu links point to new Process Services pages for processes and tasks instead of the old pages. A link to the Process Services user interface is also available in the same menu.

-   You can still reach your old internal workflows and create new ones:

    -   The original *My Tasks* dashlet is still available, making it possible to list old internal workflows but also receive new site invitations.

    -   The original *My Tasks* page can still be accessed by clicking the *Internal Tasks* link on the new Activiti *My Tasks* page, making it possible to continue working with the internal workflows.

    -   The original *My Workflows* page can still be accessed by clicking the *Internal Workflows* link on the new Activiti *Processes* page, making it possible to continue working with the internal workflows.

    -   The original *Start Workflow* page can still be accessed by clicking the *Start Workflow* link on the new Activiti *Start Process* page, making it possible to continue creating new internal workflows.

    -   The *Workflows* panel on the *Document details* page will list both internal and external workflows.
