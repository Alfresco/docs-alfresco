# Enabling CORS

Solutions that use Alfresco Process Services REST APIs may be in a different domain or port. This is known as Cross Origin Resource Sharing \(CORS\).

By default, CORS is not allowed to provide a high level of security. This can be alleviated by using web proxies which consolidate different domains and ports or by enabling CORS in Alfresco Process Services configuration. For more information, see [Configuring CORS](enabling-cors.md).
