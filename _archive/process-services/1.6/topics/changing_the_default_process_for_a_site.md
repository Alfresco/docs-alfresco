# Changing the default process for a site

You can change the default process name for a site to the exact same name as the Process App name.

The easiest way to do this is to follow these steps:

1.  From the **Repository** view in Alfresco Content Services, navigate to a siteâ€™s **Document Library** folder.
2.  From the **Site Details** page, click **More** \> **Manage Aspects** and add the **Activiti Process App** aspect.
3.  Edit the folder properties and enter the name of the Process App in the **Process App Definition Name** field.

Where:

Aspect Id = `abs:activitiProcessApp`

Property = `abs:appDefinitionName`
