# Upgrading using the Process Services installer

You can use the Alfresco Process Services installation wizard to upgrade to the latest version. The process is similar to installing for the first time. For more details, see the [Installing using an installer](installing_using_an_installer.md) section.

**To upgrade**:

1.  Double-click the Alfresco Process Services installation wizard.
2.  Follow the instructions to install the latest version of Alfresco Process Services.
3.  After the installation is complete, copy the `activiti.lic` file to the Alfresco Process Services installation directory: <Install\>/tomcat/lib folder.

Alternatively, copy the license to your home directory using the terminal \(OSX\) or command prompt \(Windows\):

```
 ~/.activiti/enterprise-license/
or
C:\.activiti\enterprise-license
```

**Tip**: You can also upload a license from the user interface. See the [Uploading a license from the User Interface](uploading_a_license_from_the_user_interface_ui.md) section for more details.
