# OAuth 2 SSO features

Use this information to understand the features of OAuth 2 SSO for Alfresco Process Services.

OAuth 2 introduces the following new features:

-   A built-in OAuth 2 client delivered as a part of the Alfresco Process Services. The client can request and handle OAuth 2 tokens from the OAuth 2.0 Authorization Servers.
-   The Alfresco OAuth 2 Authorization Server - a fully functioning lightweight micro service that simplifies development, testing, and deployment of REST based applications using OAuth 2 for authorization.
-   A special OAuth 2 gateway to Alfresco Content Services that allows use of OAuth 2 authorization to Alfresco Content Services.

**Note:** OAuth 2 SSO does not eliminate the issues of different identity systems and requires user synchronization with the Alfresco Process Services user database.
