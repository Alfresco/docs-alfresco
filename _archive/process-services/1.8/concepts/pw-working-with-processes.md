The **Processes** list shows the details of the currently running processes.

To view your processes, click ![](../images/PW-processes-icon.png).

If you are using the expanded menu, you can see a more complete list of processes and you can filter the list for **Running**, **Completed** and **All** processes.

New processes that you create will appear in this list.
