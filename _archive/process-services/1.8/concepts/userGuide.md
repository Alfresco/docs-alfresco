# Using Alfresco Process Services

Alfresco Process Services 1.8 gives you two ways of accessing your tasks and processes.

-   Process Workspace
-   Alfresco Process Services Landing Page

Alfresco Process Services 1.8 introduces a new end-user app for working with tasks and processes, called Process Workspace.

For developers, this is a new user experience based on ADF 2.0, enabling high customization and faster time-to-value.

The Alfresco Process Services Landing Page continues to provide a user interface for managing your tasks but with the additional features for process design and profile management.

-   **[Alfresco Process Services Workspace](../concepts/pw_using_intro.md)**  
Process Workspace is a new, easy to use app for you to work with your tasks and processes, and it gives you the flexibility to work on either a web interface or on mobile.
-   **[Process Services Landing Page](../concepts/Landing-page.md)**  
The Landing Page is your user interface to Process Services. Each tile gives you tools for distinct sets of tasks.
