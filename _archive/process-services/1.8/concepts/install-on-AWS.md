# Installing Alfresco Process Services on AWS

Alfresco Process Services can be deployed on AWS Cloud using a Quick Start to deploy in a clustered configuration.

Quick Starts help you to deploy solutions on AWS Cloud. Quick Starts are automated reference deployments for key enterprise workloads on the AWS Cloud. Each Quick Start launches, configures, and runs the AWS compute, network, storage, and other services required to deploy a specific workload on AWS, using AWS best practices for security and availability. The key benefit is that it lets you deploy a reference deployment quickly and automatically on the AWS Cloud. In many cases, solutions can be deployed with a single click.

The **AWS Quick Start for Alfresco Process Services** consists of a collection of templates and instruction guide created by our Architects in conjunction with Amazon's Solutions Architects. The Quick Start automatically:

-   Creates and configures all required infrastructural resources in the AWS cloud

-   Deploys Alfresco Process Services in a clustered configuration

The Quick Start defines the architecture for the most common Alfresco Process Services deployment, and enables customers and partners to launch a production-ready Alfresco Process Services environment in their own AWS cloud in less than an hour. It can be launched directly from the [AWS Quick Start for Alfresco Process Services landing page](https://aws.amazon.com/quickstart/architecture/alfresco-process-services/?platform=hootsuite) using your account into your either VPC or a new VPC.

AWS CloudFormation templates describe the related AWS resources that you want for your deployment, and let you provision and update them in an orderly and predictable way.

In conjunction with AWS, Alfresco has published a **Deployment Guide** for IT infrastructure architects, administrators, and DevOps professionals who are planning to implement or extend their Alfresco Process Services workloads on the AWS cloud, and is available at [AWS Quick Start for Alfresco Process Services](https://s3.amazonaws.com/quickstart-reference/alfresco/process/services/latest/doc/alfresco-process-services-on-the-aws-cloud.pdf). It discusses the architectural considerations and configuration steps for deploying an Alfresco Process Services cluster on the Amazon Web Services \(AWS\) Cloud. It also provides links for viewing and launching AWS CloudFormation templates that automate the deployment.
