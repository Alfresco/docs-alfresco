# Enabling Share Connector

By default, the bundled *Review Processes* app is not created. To create one, add the following file into the <InstallLocation\>/lib/activiti-app.properties.

```
# Enable the Share Connector process app
app.review-workflows.enabled=true
```

Restart Process Services for it to take effect.
