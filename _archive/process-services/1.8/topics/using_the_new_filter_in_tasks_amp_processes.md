# Using the new filter in tasks and processes

When you create a new filter in the Tasks tab or Processes tab, you can filter by process definition, the state of the task/process, by task name, and by assignment. You can also change the default sort order.

-   **Process definition**

    Select an active \(running\) process name, and display only those tasks that are associated with that process.

-   **State**

    Choose to display tasks or processes based on its state. For tasks, select Completed or Open. Completed is selected by default. For processes, select Running, complete, or All. Running is selected by default.

-   **Assignment**

    Select tasks in which you are involved, or tasks that have been assigned to you, or tasks where you are one of the several candidates. This is only applicable to the Tasks tab.

-   **Sort**

    Sort the list by Newest first, Oldest first, Due last, or Due first.

-   **Task name / Process Name**

    Type a string to search for matching task names or process name depending on the tab youâ€™re in.

-   **Filter icon and name**

    Select an icon for your new filter by clicking on the funnel icon, and specify a name for the filter.


**Note:**

If you have no tasks or processes running, then James will appear with a shortcut to let you create a new task for yourself or start an existing process and track its progress.
