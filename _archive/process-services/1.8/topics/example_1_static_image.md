# Example 1: Static image

This is a very basic example of a custom form field type that simply displays a static image.

\*Create a new form stencil in the App Designer and click the *Add new item* link.

The *Form run-time template* \(the HTML used when the form is rendered at run-time\) and the *Form editor template* \(the HTML used in the form builder\) is the same here:

```
<img src="http://activiti.org/images/activiti_logo.png"></img>
```
