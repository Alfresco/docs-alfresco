# End process Step

An end process step is available only when defining a substep within a choice step. You use an end process step to stop the process within a choice step in your process definition. Since this is a terminal step, no + \(plus\) icon appears after the step.

In the **End process step** dialog \> **Details** tab, define the task name and description.
