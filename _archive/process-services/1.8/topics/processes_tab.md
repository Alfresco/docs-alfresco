# Processes tab

Use the Processes tab to start a new process from a list of published process definitions. The Processes tab is organized into three columns similar to the [Tasks tab](tasks_tab.md) except that instead of tasks, process details are displayed. You can also create a new filter to filter by process definitions, process state, and by process name.
