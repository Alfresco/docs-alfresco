# Email step

When an email step starts in a running process, it sends an email with a fixed text body and a fixed title to a single or multiple recipients.

The email step dialog contains two tabs that let you fully define the task.

Name and Description are simple text fields that help you and others to identify the task in your task list.

Recipient type lets you choose who receives the email defined in this step:

-   **Process initiator recipient**

    The user who starts the process is the sole recipient of the email. This is the default.

-   **Single user recipient**

    If you choose this option, a Recipient field is displayed to allow you to search for single user or select someone using an email address.

-   **Multiple user recipients**

    If you choose this option a second Recipients field is displayed to allow you add one or more users. You can add Alfresco Process Services users or select someone using an email address.
