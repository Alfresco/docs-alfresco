# Capabilities tab

Use the Capabilities tab for managing the capabilities and groups of users that are available for this tenant.

There are two types of groups:

-   **Capability groups** - Groups that can be granted with variety of capabilities.

-   **Organization groups** - Functional groups that reflect the structure of your organization.


The following capability groups are available by default:

-   **Analytics-users** - Access the Analytics app to view reports.

-   **Superusers** - Administration of tenant of this group gives full administration rights for the current tenant to the selected group.

-   **App Designer** - Access to App Designer app that allows you to design and publish process definitions.


In addition, an Administrator can grant to the following capabilities to any of the capabilities groups:

-   Access Analytics app

-   Access App Designer app

-   Access the REST API

-   Access to all tenants' models

-   Administration of tenant of this group

-   Publish app to user dashboard

-   Upload license


You create and delete capabilities groups, add and remove users to and from a group, and add and remove capabilities to and from all users in a group.
