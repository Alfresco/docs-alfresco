# Structural components

You use structural components to group multiple components in a sub process to reuse in a parent process definition, and to embed and call other process definitions from inside your own process.

-   **[Sub-process](../topics/sub_process.md)**  
A sub process is a single activity that contains activities, gateways, and events which form a process. A sub process is completely embedded inside a parent process.
-   **[Collapsed sub-process](../topics/collapsed_sub_process.md)**  
You use a collapsed sub-process to add an existing process from your available process definitions as a sub-process to the process definition you are currently editing.
-   **[Event sub-process](../topics/event_sub_process.md)**  
An event sub-process is a sub-process that is triggered by an event. You can use an event sub-process in your main process, or in any sub-process.
-   **[Call activity](../topics/call_activity.md)**  
A call activity is used to execute another process definition as part of the current process instance.
