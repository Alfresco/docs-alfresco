# Minimal configuration

At a minimum, the application requires the following settings to run:

-   A database connection that is configured either [Using JDBC Connection Parameters](databaseConfiguration.md#jdbc) or [Using a JNDI Data Source](databaseConfiguration.md#jndi)

-   An accurate Hibernate dialect - see [Hibernate Settings](databaseConfiguration.md#hibernate)


All other properties use the default settings, and this will be allow the application to start up and run.
