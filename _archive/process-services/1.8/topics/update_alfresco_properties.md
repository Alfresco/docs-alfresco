# Update Alfresco Properties

The Update Alfresco Properties option enables you to update content-specific properties in Alfresco Content Services using a form field or variable. For example, you can update properties of a document linked from Alfresco Content Services via a form attachment field, or process variable.

The Properties sheet displays the same fields as Retrieve Alfresco properties, except that is used for updating properties rather than retrieving.
