# Business Calendar settings

Business Calendar is used to calculate relative due dates for tasks. To exclude weekends when calculating a taskâ€™s relative due date, set the `calendar.weekends` property as follows:

```
# Weekend days comma separated (day's first 3 letters in capital)
calendar.weekends=SAT,SUN
```
