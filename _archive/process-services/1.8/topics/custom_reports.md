# Custom reports

There are a number of out-of-the-box reports in the Analytics app, which can be augmented with your own custom reports.

Custom reports have full access to the ElasticSearch indexes generated by Alfresco Process Services when this is enabled.

See [Administering](adminGuide.md) for details on how to configure events to be sent to ElasticSearch\), but must be implemented as a custom Spring bean.

The following section assumes that you have a reasonable understanding of what ElasticSearch is and an understanding of indexes, types and type mappings. The [ElasticSearch Definitive Guide](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/guide/1.x/index.html) is a great learning resource if you are new to the engine and there is also a [Reference Guide](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/1.7/index.html) which you should find helpful to refer to as you start using it directly yourself.

-   **[Setting up ElasticSearch for development](../topics/setting_up_elasticsearch_for_development.md)**  
You can set up an external instance of ElasticSearch 1.7.3 on your machine and configure Process Services to connect to it.
-   **[Implementing custom reports](../topics/implementing_custom_reports.md)**  
Assuming that you have started to see some data show up in the ElasticSearch store and therefore in the out-of-the-box reports, and you have used the Sense tool or cURL to develop some custom search queries of your own, you are ready to start implementing the custom Spring bean required in order to plug the report into the Process Services UI.
