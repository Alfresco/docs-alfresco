**Administration enhancements**

This release introduces new enhancements to the Administration app that provide additional features for Administrators.

As an administrator, you can now download binary process data and uploaded files from the Admin Console to help you to troubleshoot the problem.

See [Downloading binary process data files](../tasks/admin-app-binary-download.md) for more information.

Now you can create read-only admin users so that others can help debug problems without accidentally altering information.
