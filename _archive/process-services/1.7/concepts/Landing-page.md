# Process Services Landing Page

The landing page is your user interface to Process Services. When you first log in, you will see your landing page.

Each tile gives you tools for distinct sets of tasks.

You can get back to your landing page at any time by clicking on the Process Serviceslogo on the header.

Your landing page is dynamic, and new tiles will appear when you create new process apps in the App Designer and deploy them in the Task App.

You'll also see a list of shortcuts for tasks you might want to do next.

**Note:** If you are an administrator, your landing page is slightly different. Instead of the Profile management tile, youâ€™ll find a more powerful set of tools called the Identity management tile.

All pages display the App Navigator icon in the far-right corner of the header. It provides useful 1-click shortcuts to various parts of the app. You can navigate instantly to all your process models, tasks, processes, stencils, forms, decision tables, quickly start any process, view the tasks and processes for a published and deployed app, or view and change your profile. As you deploy process apps, the App Navigator will also show shortcuts for the newly created process apps.

-   **[App Designer](../topics/App_Designer_app.md)**  
Use the App Designer to create process models, forms, app definitions, and share your models and definitions with others. As you create items, they appear as tiles on their respective page. The Last Modified drop-down on the top-right enables you to sort the display order ranging from last modified, oldest first, name order, or reverse name order. Use the filter on the left to filter the list of displayed items. Additionally, if you are unable to find a specific process, use the search box to find more processes. If your processes require human input, then you will need forms to gather it.
-   **[Task App](../topics/task_app.md)**  
Use the Task App to access your task list and work on tasks assigned to you from the Processes tab. This is also where you initiate new processes and tasks.
-   **[Profile management](../topics/profile_management.md)**  
 This tile will appear for you only if you are a user. This is where you manage your personal information.
-   **[Identity Management](../topics/identity_management.md)**  
These are operations to manage tenants, groups and users. This is useful for example to bootstrap environments with the correct identity data.
-   **[Analytics App](../topics/analytics_app.md)**  
Use the Analytics App tile to add standard reports and configure custom reports for performance and throughput statistics of your processes. You can view the Analytics App tile only if your account has the Analytics capability. Before generating process reports, make sure to run your processes at least a few times.
-   **[Step editor](../topics/step_editor.md)**  
The Step Editor guides you through creating a business process through a sequence of simple steps. The processes you create using the step editor do not exploit the full power of BPMN 2.0 like those created by the BPMN editor, but you can use it to design both simple and quite complex process models, without knowledge of BPMN 2.0.
-   **[BPMN editor](../topics/bpmn_editor.md)**  
With the BPMN editor you can create process definitions using the capabilities of BPMN 2.0. You build your process by dragging and dropping from a palette of grouped components to a canvas on which your process diagram is built.
-   **[Form editor](../topics/form_editor.md)**  
The form editor provides a powerful drag and drop interface to let you design forms from a rich set of controls. You can define form outcomes and create forms with multiple tabs. Individual controls and whole tabs can be made visible depending on the value of other form fields and process variables. You can design your form with groups of controls in varying numbers of columns.
-   **[Business rules - decision tables](../topics/business_rules_decision_tables.md)**  
There are many situations in a business process where you wish to evaluate some data you have collected and come to some conclusion or decision. Business rules provide a natural way to express the logic of decision making. Typical decision examples are calculating discounts, credit ratings, who to assign tasks to, what service level \(SLA\) to use, and so on.
-   **[Data Models](../topics/data_models.md)**  
A Data Model enables you to access and manipulate data related to a business process in Alfresco Process Services. For example, you can define a data model that maps to a relational database \(via JDBC\) or a custom API to connect to an external source such as a patient database or a customer database.
-   **[Creating your first process](../topics/creating_your_first_process.md)**  
In Process Services, you create a process models to represent a series of tasks in your business process. This tutorial guides you through creating a simple process model.
-   **[Creating your first app](../topics/creating_your_first_app.md)**  
You create an Alfresco Process Services process app to group together a number of processes to make them available to yourself or other users. An app is the container for handling a group of published processes and deploying them to a Process Engine. This tutorial leads you through the steps required to create and use an app containing a single process.
-   **[Starting your first process](../topics/starting_your_first_process.md)**  
You start a process from the Processes tab of the Task app page. In this section, you are going to start and monitor the process you designed in the previous tutorial. To start the process, first add a process to an app and deploy that app deployed.
-   **[Creating a single task](../topics/creating_a_single_task.md)**  
As you have seen from previous sections, processes are made up of individual tasks. You can also create a single task for yourself or others and assign it for completion. This tutorial guides you through the steps for creating and completing a single task.
