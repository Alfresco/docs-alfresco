**Single Sign-On Authentication Improvements**

Alfresco Process Services 7.0 now supports OAuth 2.0 Single Sign-On for the Process Services application. OAuth 2 support is already available for developers wishing to leverage the REST APIs. Providing application authentication represents a next step towards a single standards-authorization and identity services across the Alfresco Digital Business Platform.

See [Configuring the OAuth 2.0 client for the APS app](../concepts/ps-app-config-OAuth-client.md) for more.
