# Tasks tab

The Tasks tab is organized into three columns.

-   The left column lets you filter the list of displayed tasks. There are four pre-defined filters and a New Filter control which lets you define and name your own filters. Any filters you create are added to the list of displayed filters. See LINKHERE.

-   The middle column provides tools for creating new tasks, and lists the tasks included by the current active filter. Click on the accordion icon above the list of tasks to change the default display order from Newest first to oldest first, Due last order, or Due first order.

-   The right column is displayed when you click on a task in the middle column. It displays the selected task details and also tools for completing open tasks and for viewing the audit log of a completed task.


**Note:** The Audit log button is only available for a completed process instance or a completed task.

-   **[Using the new filter in tasks and processes](../topics/using_the_new_filter_in_tasks_amp_processes.md)**  
When you create a new filter in the Tasks tab or Processes tab, you can filter by process definition, the state of the task/process, by task name, and by assignment. You can also change the default sort order.
