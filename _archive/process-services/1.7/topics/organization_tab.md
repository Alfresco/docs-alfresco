# Organization tab

Use the Organization tab to create functional groups that reflect the structure of your organization. You can also add and remove users to and from a group, and create subgroups within this kind of group.

**Note:** When you remove a group, it will be deactivated, until all its tasks are complete. To remove the group completely, click the remove button a second time. When you remove a group, this will remove all its sub groups too.
