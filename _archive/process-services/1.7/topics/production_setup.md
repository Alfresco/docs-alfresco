# Setting up the Share Connector

This section describes how to install the Share Connector in a production environment.

To set up the Share Connector, you need to configure an LDAP user database for common use between Alfresco Content Services and Process Services. This allows both systems to sync their user database against a single LDAP server. If you do not use the same LDAP user database, the Share Connector will not work.

**Note:** If you want to get the Share Connector up and running as quickly as possible but not in a production environment, then you can use [Setting up the Share Connector Demo](demo_setup.md).

-   **[Alfresco Content Services configuration](../topics/content_services_config.md)**  
Alfresco Content Services can be used to:
-   **[Modifying the default settings](../topics/modifying_the_default_settings.md)**  
 You can modify the default settings by changing either the port or the repository configuration.
-   **[Alfresco Process Services configuration](../topics/process_services_config.md)**  
Log in to the Alfresco Process Services landing page to set up the configuration for the Share Connector.
