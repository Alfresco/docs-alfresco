You can click on the Alfresco Process Services logo at any time to return to your landing page.

The Landing Page is the starting point from which you can use:

-   **App Designer** - Design your process

-   **My Tasks** - View your task inbox or queue

-   **Profile management** / **Identity management** - Manage user and group capabilities
