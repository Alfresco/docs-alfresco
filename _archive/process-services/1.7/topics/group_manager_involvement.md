# Group Manager Involvement

When a task is created that has one or more candidate groups assigned, the group managers for those groups will be automatically involved with the created task. To stop group managers from being involved, set the following property to false.

|Property

|default

|app.runtime.groupTasks.involveGroupManager.enabled

|true

**Note:** Users that do not have a primary group defined may not have a group manager. To define the primary group, go to **Identity Management** \> **Users** \> **Select an action** \> **Change primary group**.
