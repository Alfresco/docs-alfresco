# Artifacts

You use artifacts to provide additional information about the process. The BPMN editor supports the text annotation artifact which associates additional text to an element in your process, or to the process itself. The text does not influence the execution of a process and is provided by the process designer to give information to the user of the process.

**Text annotation**

You can set the following properties in the property sheet:

|Property|Description|
|--------|-----------|
|Id

|A unique identifier for this element instance

|
|Name

|A name for this element instance

|
|Documentation

|A description of this element instance

|
|Text

|The text you want to display in your annotation
