# Creating your first app

You create an Alfresco Process Services process app to group together a number of processes to make them available to yourself or other users. An app is the container for handling a group of published processes and deploying them to a Process Engine. This tutorial leads you through the steps required to create and use an app containing a single process.

This tutorial uses the process model created in the [Creating your first process](creating_your_first_process.md) tutorial.

1.  Go to **App Designer** \> **Apps** tab, and click **Create App**.

    The Create a new app definition dialog appears.

2.  Enter a name for your app and click **Create a new app definition**.

    Use the name **My First App** for this tutorial.

3.  Choose an icon and theme for your new app tile.
4.  Click **Edit included models** and select a process\(s\) of your choice. In this case, select the published model from the [Creating your first process](creating_your_first_process.md) tutorial.
5.  Click **Save**, and select the **Publish** check box in the Save app definition dialog to save and publish your app.

    Publishing an app makes it available to everyone youâ€™ve shared it with.

6.  You can now add the app as a tile on your landing page.
    1.  On the landing page, click on the last tile labeled with a + \(plus\) icon. The Add app to landing page dialog appears.
    2.  Select **My First App** from the list of published apps and click **Deploy**.

        A new app tile is added to your landing page.


Your app is now deployed and ready to be used.
