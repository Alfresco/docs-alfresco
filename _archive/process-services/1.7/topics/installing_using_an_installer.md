# Installing using an installer

The installer for Windows, OSX, or Linux installs an evaluation copy of Alfresco Process Services that may be used for quick trials and experimentation. The installer will install all the prerequisite software that Alfresco Process Services needs on your platform. You will need to add a license file, which will have been provided with the download links.

The installed Alfresco Process Servicesruns in its own [Apache Tomcat](http://tomcat.apache.org/) container, and uses a built-in [h2 database](http://www.h2database.com/). This database is not suitable for production use.
