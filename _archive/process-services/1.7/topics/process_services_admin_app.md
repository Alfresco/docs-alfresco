# Alfresco Process Services Administrator application

You can use the Alfresco Process Services Administrator application with the [Setting up the Share Connector Demo](demo_setup.md), however you must first update the endpoint in the Administrator application.

**To update the Process Services endpoint:**

1.  Sign in to the Alfresco Process Services app with the default admin/admin credentials:

    [http://127.0.0.1:8080/activiti-admin/](http://127.0.0.1:8080/activiti-admin/)

    A message appears indicating that an error occurred while getting data from the server.

2.  Click **Edit Activiti REST endpoint** and set the **Username** to *admin* and **Password** to *password*, then click **Save**.

    A confirmation message appears confirming that the endpoints were successfully updated.
