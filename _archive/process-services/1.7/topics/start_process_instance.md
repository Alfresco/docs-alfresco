# Start Process Instance

To start process instances, use:

```
POST api/enterprise/process-instances
```

With a json body that contains following properties:

-   `processDefinitionId`: The process definition identifier. Do not use it with processDefinitionKey.

-   `processDefinitionKey`: The process definition key. Do not use it with `processDefinitionId`.

-   `name`: The name to give to the created process instance.

-   `values`: A JSON object with the form field Id and form field values. The Id of the form field is retrieved from the start form call \(see above\).

-   `outcome`: If the start form has outcomes, this is one of those values.

-   `variables`: Contains a JSON array of variables. Values and outcomes canâ€™t be used with variables.


The response will contain the process instance details including the ID.

Once started, the completed form \(if defined\) can be fetched using:

```
GET /enterprise/process-instances/{processInstanceId}/start-form
```
