# REST API

Alfresco Process Services comes with a REST API. The REST API is an enterprise equivalent of the Open Source REST API, exposing the generic Process Engine operations. It also includes a dedicated set of REST API endpoints for features specific to Alfresco Process Services.

**Important:** An internal REST API also exists that is used as REST endpoints by the JavaScript user interface. Do NOT use this API as the REST API URLs might modify the product to use unsupported features. In addition, the internal REST API uses a different authentication mechanism tailored towards web browser use.
