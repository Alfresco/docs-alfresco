# Use your first process app

When you’ve created and published a process app, it can be used to request a new expense for approval

1.  Click the Expense Approval app on your dashboard then click **Start**.

2.  Complete the requested information and click **Start Process** to submit the new expense.

    The Processes page now shows the new expense approval request. From here you can add comments or cancel the process.

    If you click **Show diagram** you can see the current status of your expense claim. The active user task is highlighted in green to indicate it's at review stage. Click **Close** to go back to the claim.

3.  Click **Review** under Active Tasks to review the claim.

    **Note:** This would usually be done by a user with the required approval level.

4.  Click **Approve** to complete the task.

    This completes the claim as it is now at the end of the process flow.

    **Note:** To review completed tasks click the **Processes** tab, then click **New Filter** and select **Completed as the Process State**.
