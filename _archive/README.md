title: Legacy documentation

Use this directory to view Alfresco legacy documentation.

At the top level will be a list of products. Select a product and then choose the version to view.

The directory will be similar to:

```plaintext
concepts
ditamaps
images
references
reuse
tasks
topics
```

In the `ditamaps` directory will be an `index.md` containing the table of contents for that version. Use this table of contents to navigate through the documentation.
