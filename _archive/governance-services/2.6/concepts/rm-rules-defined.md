# Working with a set of rules

You can easily view and maintain the individual rules that makes up the rule set. You can add, edit, and delete rules, make a rule inactive, and change the run order. You can also manually run rules.

You can create many rules to form a full set of rules, and then apply multiple rules to categories and folders.

When you select the **Manage Rules** action for a category/folder with defined rules, the Rules page is split into two.

The left side of the page lists the rules that make up the rule set. If the category/folder inherits rules from a parent category/folder, those rules appear here too. The rules run in the order they're listed. Inherited rules are always run first.

A check mark to the left of the rule means it's active.

Selecting an individual rule in this list displays its details on the right side of the page.

-   **[Adding to a set of rules](../tasks/rm-rules-new.md)**  
A set of rules can include any number of individual rules, and you can add new rules to a category or folder as you need.
-   **[Editing a rule](../tasks/rm-rules-edit.md)**  
You might need to revisit your rules from time to time and make some changes to keep them current. If you donâ€™t want to use a specific rule anymore but think you might need it again in the future, you can just disable it.
-   **[Reordering the rules in the rule set](../tasks/rm-rules-reorder.md)**  
As part of managing your rule set you can pick the order in which the rules are run. If your category or folder has inherited rules, those are always run first in the order they're listed. Any rules marked as inactive are simply skipped.
-   **[Turning off inherited rules](../tasks/rm-rules-inherited.md)**  
If a category or folder is inheriting rules from a parent category or folder, you can easily turn them on and off as needed.
-   **[Deleting a rule](../tasks/rm-rules-delete.md)**  
When a category or folder has a rule applied that you don't need anymore, you can delete the individual rule.
