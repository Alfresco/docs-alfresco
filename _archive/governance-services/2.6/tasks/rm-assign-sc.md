# Setting security clearance

Alfresco Administrators can assign different clearance levels to users and groups that give access to files and records within their clearance level.

**Note:** You need to have the Alfresco Administrator role to set security clearance. You can't change the clearance level of the default Alfresco Administrator.

1.  Click **Admin Tools** and then click **Security Controls \> Assign**.

    Users and groups are shown with their current classification clearance \(the predefined security group\).

    -   **Top Secret** - Can see all files and records with any classification level
    -   **Secret** - Can see secret, confidential, and unclassified files and records
    -   **Confidential** - Can see confidential, and unclassified files and records
    -   **No Clearance** - Can see unclassified files and records
    Hover over **Details** to see all security groups and security marks assigned to a user.

    **Note:** You won't see marks assigned to a user if you don't have clearance for them.

2.  Type a user's name or group name into the filter box to find the user / group.

    **Tip:** You can sort users by clicking **Name**, and view a user profile by clicking a user name.

    Click to select to view Groups and Users, or just Users or Groups.

3.  Hover over a user or group and click **Set Security Controls** next to them to change the security groups and marks they're assigned.

4.  Currently assigned security marks are highlighted. Click a security mark to assign it to the user / group, and again to unassign it.

    **Note:** Marks that are inherited from another group aren't shown, only marks that are assigned directly to this user / group.

5.  Click **Apply**, and any changes you've made are applied.

    **Note:** If a user has marks assigned that you don't have access to then these will be unaffected by any changes you make.
