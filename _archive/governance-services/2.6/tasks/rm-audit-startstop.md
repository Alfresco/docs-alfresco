# Stopping and starting the audit log

If you have an audit running then you can stop it and restart it later.

    A dialog box prompts you to confirm the action.

2.  Click **Yes**.

    The auditing tool stops capturing and storing the activity in the Records Management system.

3.  To start the audit log again, click **Start**. When prompted, click **Yes** to confirm the action.
