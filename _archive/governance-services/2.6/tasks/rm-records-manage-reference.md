# Creating relationships between records

You can add relationships to records to create a connection between them. This can be useful, for example, to track records that have been superseded or obsoleted.

1.  Hover over a record in the File Plan and click **More** then **Add Relationship**.

2.  Select a relationship type in the New Relationship screen.

    **Note:** Most relationships don't alter or affect a record in any way, they are just used to create an association between records.

    However, if you select Obsoleted by/Obsoletes or Superseded by/Supersedes, then any outstanding retention schedule obsoleted or superseded events will be automatically completed.

3.  Click **Select Record** and then select a record to create a relationship with by clicking ![Add](../images/ico-add.png).

4.  Click **OK**.

    The selected record is shown in the New Relationship screen.

5.  Click **Create**.

    You can repeat these steps to add relationships to multiple other records. You can see details of any relationships when you click on a record to preview it, and relationships can be added and deleted here if you have the correct permissions.

    When records are created from versions of the same file, a relationship between the records is automatically created.
