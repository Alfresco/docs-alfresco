# Viewing the full log

You can view the full contents of the log file in a separate window. From there you can save an HTML version of the report on your computer or in the Records Management File Plan.

1.  When you've run an audit, click **View Recent Log** in the Audit tool of the RM Admin Tools.

    A separate window opens displaying the audit log.

2.  You can save the log report in one or both of the following ways:

    -   Click **Export** to save the report to your computer.
    -   Click **File as Record** to file the report in the File Plan.
    **Note:** If you select **File as Record** you'll need to add any required metadata before the record can be completed.

3.  Close the window.
