# Exporting the audit log

You can export the audit log which is useful for archiving it regularly so that you can examine or analyze system activity.

When you export the audit log, this doesn't affect the audit log in the system.

1.  When you've run an audit, click **Export** in the Audit tool of the RM Admin Tools.

    Depending on your browser you'll be prompted to open or save the file or it will be saved automatically. The exported audit log is an HTML file.
