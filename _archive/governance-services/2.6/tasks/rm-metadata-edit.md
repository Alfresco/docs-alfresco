# Editing record metadata

You can edit record metadata to add information to a record.

Before you can complete a record, you must enter any required details about the record in the metadata. You can't edit record metadata after you have set the record to complete.

1.  Hover over a record in the File Plan and click **Edit Metadata**.

    The Edit Metadata page displays. The metadata fields you see on this page depend on the file type, and whether or not record types have been associated with the file. The metadata is divided into sections, with additional sections dependant on if a record type has been associated with the item.

2.  Enter the record metadata. Fields marked with an asterisk \(\*\) are required.

    If your Records Management system is DoD 5015.2-STD compliant then every file includes the DOD5015 Record section, which is a default set of basic metadata fields. The default record metadata fields are:

    |Record|Â |
    |------|--|
    |Publication date\*|The date that the record is published. Select the date from the calendar selection box.|
    |Originator\*|The person or department in the originating organization.|
    |Originating Organization\*|The organization that created the record.|
    |Media Type|The general media type such as audio, video, or document.|
    |Format|The format in which the record is stored, such as electronic or physical file.|
    |Date received|The date that the record was received from the originator.|
    |Addressee|The email address of the originating organization to be used for correspondence.|
    |Other Addressee|The secondary recipients of the message \(CC\).|
    |Location|The physical location of the record, generally only applicable to non-electronic records.|
    |Supplemental Marking List|Any additional properties applicable to the record. This list is defined by the Alfresco administrator in the **List of Values** in the RM Admin Tools.This is available in both standard and DoD 5015.2-STD compliant File Plans.

    You can't save this page until you complete any required fields.

3.  Click **Save**.
