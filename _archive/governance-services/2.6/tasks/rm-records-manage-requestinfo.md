2.  Click **Select** and select a user or group to request the information from.

3.  Enter details of what you need in the Requested information box.

4.  Click **Request Information**.

    A task will be assigned to the selected user and will show in their My Tasks dashlet. Once they mark the task as done the information they provide will be shown in a task assigned to the user who requested the information.
