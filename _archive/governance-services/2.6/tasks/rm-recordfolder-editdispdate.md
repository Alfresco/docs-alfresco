# Editing a folder retention date

If a folder is subject to a folder level retention schedule, you can review the retention date for the next step in the retention schedule that applies to the folder. This is done at folder level only and does not affect the retention schedule.

1.  Hover over a folder in the File Plan and click **More** then **Edit Retention Date**.

    The Edit Retention Date dialog box displays. The current retention date is highlighted.

2.  Select a new retention date and click **Update**.

    A message displays confirming that the retention date is updated. This overrules any review dates set in the retention schedule.
