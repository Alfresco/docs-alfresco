-   [Classify folders and categories](whats-new-rm.md#2)
-   [Governance ServicesRecords Management REST API](whats-new-rm.md#3)

**Automatic classification with Classification Guides**

Classification Guides contain instruction templates so that you can quickly and easily classify content. Each classification guide is made up of topics that contain instructions. If these instructions are selected when classifying a piece of content, it is automatically classified according to those instructions. This gives you more control over how your content is classified. See [Creating classification guides](../tasks/rm-create-guide.md).

**Classify folders and categories**

You can now classify not just records and files, but also standard folders in an Alfresco Share site, and record folders record categories. Classification is done in exactly the same way. Contents of a classified folder, record folder, or category can only be navigated to by those with the required security clearance, even if the contents themselves haven't been directly classified. They can still be viewed by people who have a shared URL.

**Governance ServicesRecords Management REST API**

The REST API lets you manage the File Plan and its components from your own applications.

It gives your application access to file plans, records, record containers, transfers, the Records Management site, and more. Response and request bodies are all specified with simple JSON. See [Governance Services Records Management APIs](../concepts/gs-api-overview.md).
