# Defining rules for a category or folder

Use rules to manage your File Plan content automatically. There are two ways to define rules: create your own rules or link to rules already created for a different category or folder.

When you define a rule, it only applies to new content added to the category/folder. Items that were in the category/folder before the rule was defined aren't affected by it. You can manually apply the category/folder rules with the **Run Rules** action.

If you create rules for a category, depending on the rule settings, they can apply to folders and categories created in the category, records placed in folders in the category, or both.

**Note:** Even if a category/folder doesn't have its own rules, it could have inherited category/folder from a parent folder. A message on the Rules page lets you know if this is the case.

-   **[Creating a rule](../tasks/rm-rules-define-create.md)**  
You can create rules for a category or folder, in much the same way that you might apply rules to your emails.
-   **[Linking to an existing rule set](../tasks/rm-rules-define-link.md)**  
The **Link to Rule Set** option lets you reuse an existing rule set that's already defined for another category or folder.
