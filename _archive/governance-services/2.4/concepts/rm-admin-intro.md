# Administering Records Management

The RM Admin Tools is where you configure the Records Management site.

The user who created the Records Management site is automatically made a member of the Records Management Administrator group. Other users can access different areas of the **RM Admin Tools** depending on the capabilities given to the role that they're in.

-   **[Opening the RM Admin Tools](../tasks/rm-console-access.md)**  
You can easily configure Records Management using the RM Admin Tools.
-   **[Audit](../concepts/rm-audit-intro.md)**  
The Audit tool is used for external audits to demonstrate compliance to regulatory requirements, and for internal audits for process improvement.
-   **[Custom metadata](../concepts/rm-custmeta-intro.md)**  
Records Management has default sets of metadata for records, record categories, record folders, and non-electronic documents.
-   **[Define roles](../concepts/rm-roles-intro.md)**  
Records Management roles and capabilities control what functionality is available to users.
-   **[Email Mappings](../concepts/rm-emailmap-intro.md)**  
One of the many ways that you can file data in the Records Management system is by storing inbound emails as records.
-   **[Events](../concepts/rm-events-intro.md)**  
The life cycle of a record is controlled by either time-based or event-based triggers that are set in the disposition schedule. You can edit events and create entirely new ones. When you create an event, you can't delete it.
-   **[List of values](../concepts/rm-lov-intro.md)**  
When users edit metadata for folders and records, one of the field types available is a list of values.
-   **[Relationships](../concepts/rm-relationships-intro.md)**  
In the File Plan you can create relationships between records.
-   **[User Rights Report](../tasks/rm-userrights-view.md)**  
The User Rights Report gives you a summary of the Records Management site users, groups, and roles.
-   **[Users and groups](../concepts/rm-usergroups-intro.md)**  
Alfresco users and groups are created by the Alfresco administrator using the Alfresco Share Admin Tools. You can then assign these users and groups to Records Management roles using the Users and Groups tool in the RM Admin Tools.
