# QuickStart for Records Management Users

As a user of the Alfresco Records Management site you need to file records ad process them as easily as possible.

Your Records Manager will have organized the site and set up retention and disposition schedules, leaving you to get on with managing and processing the site records.

In this QuickStart guide you'll see how to get started with the basics immediately.

-   **[Filing an electronic record](../tasks/rm-electronic-file.md)**  
Electronic records are files that are uploaded to a records folder.
-   **[Declaring a file as a record](../tasks/rm-create-record.md)**  
You can create records from files in non-Records Management sites and add them straight into the File Plan.
-   **[Filing an unfiled record](../tasks/rm-file-unfiled.md)**  
When you've declared a record from a non-Records Management site it's added to the Unfiled Records area. You now need to add it to a records folder.
-   **[Adding record metadata](../tasks/rm-metadata-add.md)**  
All records in the File Plan have metadata, which you can think of as records properties.
-   **[Editing record metadata](../tasks/rm-metadata-edit.md)**  
You can edit record metadata to add information to a record.
-   **[Completing a record](../tasks/rm-record-declare.md)**  
Content added to the File Plan must be set to complete before it is recognized as a record.
-   **[Processing records](../tasks/rm-dispsched-actions.md)**  
Disposition steps are generally completed manually, though retain and cut off steps can be completed automatically by a system process that is run daily. You can also set up a rule to complete steps automatically.
