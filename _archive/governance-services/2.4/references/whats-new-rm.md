# What's new in Alfresco Records Management

Alfresco Records Management just got a whole lot simpler and smarter.

We've focused our efforts on classification, so you can classify files and records so that only users with the required security clearance can view or access them. See [Classification](../concepts/rm-classification.md) for more.

-   [Classification life cycle](whats-new-rm.md#3)
-   [Data cleansing](whats-new-rm.md#4)

**Classified content and records**

Both files and records can be classified using their **Classify** option. There are four classification levels you can assign files and records to, **Top Secret**, **Secret**, **Confidential** and **Unclassified**.

When a file or record is classified it can only be seen by those with the required security clearance, and the classification level is shown on screen. Users without the necessary security clearance won't have access to it or even know that it's there. When a classified file is declared as a record it retains its classification level.

See [Classifying a file](../tasks/rm-classify-file.md) and [Classifying a record](../tasks/rm-classify-record.md) for more.

**Security clearance**

There are four default clearance levels that can be assigned to users:

-   **Top Secret** - Can see all files and records
-   **Secret** - Can see secret, confidential, and unclassified files and records
-   **Confidential** - Can see confidential and unclassified files and records
-   **No Clearance** - Can see unclassified files and records

See [Assigning security clearance](../tasks/rm-assign-sc.md) for more.

**Classification life cycle**

Classified files and records can go through downgrade and declassification schedules so that there classification level can change over time.

See [Classification life cycle](../tasks/rm-records-manage-reference.md) for more.

**Data wipe**

To ensure full security of classified content, when a classified file is deleted then it's permanently deleted and isn't available in the user Trashcan. File data is overwritten and can't be recovered.
