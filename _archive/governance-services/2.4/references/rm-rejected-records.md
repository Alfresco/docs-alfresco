# Rejected records

After you've created a record from a file, the Records Manager has the option to reject the record from the Records Management site.

If they reject the record then the original file will display a warning that it's a **Rejected Record**. At this point the options to declare the file as a record aren't available. You can:

-   Click ![Rejected record reason](../images/ico-rm-rejectreason.png) to view the reason why the record was rejected.
-   Click ![Remove rejected warning](../images/ico-delete.png) to remove the rejection warning. The options to declare the file as a record are now available again.
