# Filing a non-electronic record

Non-electronic records might be paper files that can be stored in a physical location. Filing a non-electronic record in the File Plan means the file can be traced and details of where it is physically stored can be recorded.

1.  In the record folder where you want to file a record click **File**.

2.  Click **Non-electronic**.

3.  Enter details for the file you are making a record of.

    Only the Name and Title are required, but you should enter enough information so that the record will be recognized by other users.

4.  Click **Save**.

    New records display in the File Plan as incomplete records. You need to make sure all required metadata is added before you can set records to complete.
