# Creating a new relationship

The RM Admin Tools has several default relationships. You can add more relationships, but once you create a relationship you can't delete it.

1.  Click **Relationships** in the RM Admin Tools.

2.  Click **New Relationship**.

    The New Relationship page displays.

3.  Select the relationship type:

    -   Bi-directional
    -   Parent/Child
4.  If the relationship type is Bi-directional, complete the Label field, and if the relationship type is Parent/Child, complete the Source and Target fields.

    The values you enter display in the File Plan when a user creates the reference.

    **Tip:** The existing default values give good examples of how to label relationships.

5.  Click **Save**.

    The new relationship appears in the list.
