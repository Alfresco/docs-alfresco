# Managing record folders

There are various options available to help you manage record folders. These are available to users with the appropriate capabilities.

1.  In the File Plan hover over a record folder to display the available actions. The standard actions available are shown. Additional options are available dependant on the stage a folder is at in the disposition schedule. See the relevant topics for further details.

    **Note:** When the folder is closed or on hold, a limited set of actions is available.


-   **[Viewing record folders](../tasks/rm-recordfolder-view.md)**  
The record folder details page gives you access to the actions available to be performed on the folder, the custom metadata, and the folder URL.
-   **[Editing a record folder](../tasks/rm-recordfolder-edit.md)**  
You can edit a record folder if you need to make any changes to its metadata.
-   **[Completing folder events](../tasks/rm-recordfolder-events.md)**  
If a disposition schedule has event-based steps, then you need to complete those events before the schedule can move on to the next step. Some steps are automatically completed but most of them you need to complete manually.
-   **[Editing a folder disposition date](../tasks/rm-recordfolder-editdispdate.md)**  
If a folder is subject to a folder level disposition schedule, you can review the disposition date for the next step in the disposition schedule that applies to the folder. This is done at folder level only and does not affect the disposition schedule.
-   **[Processing records](../tasks/rm-dispsched-actions.md)**  
Disposition steps are generally completed manually, though retain and cut off steps can be completed automatically by a system process that is run daily. You can also set up a rule to complete steps automatically.
-   **[Adding record folders to a hold](../tasks/rm-recordfolder-freeze.md)**  
Users with the appropriate capabilities can add records and folders to a hold.
-   **[Closing a record folder](../tasks/rm-recordfolder-close.md)**  
Users with the appropriate capability \(Folder Control\) can close folders. Closed folders cannot accept any further records.
-   **[Deleting a record folder](../tasks/rm-recordfolder-delete.md)**  
When you don't need a record folder any more you can delete it.
