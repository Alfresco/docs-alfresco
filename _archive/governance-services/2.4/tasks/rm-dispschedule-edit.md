# Editing a disposition schedule

Once a disposition schedule has been created you can go back and edit it at any point.

1.  Hover over a record category in the File Plan and click **View Details**.

    The category details page displays and if the category already has a disposition schedule then you'll see the schedule summary and steps.

2.  In the General section click **Edit** to edit the basic details, or click **Edit** in the Disposition Steps section to edit, add, or delete steps.

3.  When you've finished click **Done**.
