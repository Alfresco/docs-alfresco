# Closing a record folder

Users with the appropriate capability \(Folder Control\) can close folders. Closed folders cannot accept any further records.

1.  Hover over a record folder in the File Plan and click **Close Folder**.

    A message displays confirming that the folder is closed.

    **Note:** The action for this folder changes to **Re-open Folder**, which allows the folder to be reopened.
