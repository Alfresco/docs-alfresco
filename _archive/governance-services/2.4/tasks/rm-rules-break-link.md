# Breaking the link to a rule set

If you don't need your rules anymore, breaking the link is easy. This leaves the category/folder without any rules.

1.  Click **Manage Rules** when you're in the folder or category in the File Plan you want to break a link to rules for.

    **Tip:** You can also hover over a category/folder with rules applied \(indicated by the ![](../images/rules-icon.png) icon\) and click **More** then **Manage Rules**.

2.  Click **Unlink**.

    The link between the current category/folder and the linked rules is now broken.
