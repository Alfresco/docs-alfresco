# Editing a record disposition date

If a record is subject to a record level disposition schedule, you can review the disposition date for the next step in the disposition schedule that applies to the record. This is done at record level only and does not affect the disposition schedule.

1.  Hover over a record in the File Plan and click **More** then **Edit Disposition Date**.

    The Edit Disposition Date dialog box displays. The current disposition date is highlighted.

2.  Select a new disposition date and click **Update**.

    A message displays confirming that the disposition date is updated. This overrules any review dates set in the disposition schedule, even if you update the disposition schedule.
