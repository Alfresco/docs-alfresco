# Exporting a File Plan

Exporting a File Plan bundles the contents and structure of the entire plan into an Alfresco Content Package \(ACP\). You can also choose to export the plan as a zip file.

1.  Anywhere in the File Plan click **Export All**.

2.  Select the file format for the export and click **OK**.

    **Note:** A zip file retains the file structure, making it bigger than an ACP. In an ACP the file structure is stored in an xml file.

    Depending on your browser, you are either prompted to specify a destination or the file is automatically downloaded to a default location.
