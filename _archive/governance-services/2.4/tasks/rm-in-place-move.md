# Moving in-place records

Although in-place records have most of their options removed, you can still move them to a different place in their originating site.

This can be useful if you want to keep files that have been declared as records in a dedicated part of a site.

1.  In the Document Library of an Alfresco site find a file that's been declared as a record.

2.  Hover over the file and select **Move Record**.

3.  Choose the folder where you want to place the content.

    Files that have been declared as records can be moved to anywhere in their current site, but cannot be moved to a different site.

4.  Click **Move**.

    The file is moved to it's new location in the site. The record of the file in the Records Management site is unaffected.
