# Creating holds

Users with the appropriate capabilities can create multiple holds that are then used when records are put on hold.

**Tip:** You can only put records on hold if holds have been created to add them to.

1.  Click on the Holds area of the File Plan in the explorer panel, and click **New Hold**.

2.  Enter a Name, Description and Reason for the hold.

    **Note:** The reason will be used to when deciding which hold a record should be put on.

3.  Click **OK**.

    A new hold is now available for putting records on. You put records on hold by hovering over them in the File Plan and selecting the **Add to hold** option.


You can edit and delete holds by hovering over them in the File Plan and selecting the appropriate option, as well as managing their permissions and viewing an audit log.
