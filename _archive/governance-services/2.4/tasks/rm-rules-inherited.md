# Switching off inherited rules

If a category or folder is inheriting rules from a parent category or folder, you can easily switch them on and off as needed.

Switching inherited rules on and off works at an individual category/folder level, and will not affect any other categories/folders.

1.  Click **Manage Rules** when you're in the folder or category in the File Plan you want to switch off inherited rules for.

    **Tip:** You can also hover over a category/folder with rules applied \(indicated by the ![](../images/rules-icon.png) icon\) and click **More** then **Manage Rules**.

    If a category/folder has inherited rules these are displayed on the left side of the page.

2.  Click **Inherit Rules**.

    Any inherited rules are switched off for the category/folder and **Don't Inherit Rules** is shown. You can click **Don't Inherit Rules** to switch inherited rules back on for the category/folder.
