# Creating a new event

Records Management provides an extensive list of events, but it's easy to add to these.

1.  Click **Events** in the RM Admin Tools.

2.  Click **New Event**.

    The New Event page displays.

3.  In the **Label** field, enter a name for the event.

4.  In the **Type** field, select the event type from the following:

    -   Simple - a standard Records Management event that must be manually completed by a user
    -   Obsoleted - an event that is automatically completed when a record is obsoleted by another record based on their relationship
    -   Superseded - an event that is automatically completed when a record is superseded by another record based on their relationship
    -   Cross Referenced Record Transferred - an event that is automatically completed when a cross referenced record \(based on their relationship\) is transferred
5.  Click **Save**.


The new event displays on the Events page.
