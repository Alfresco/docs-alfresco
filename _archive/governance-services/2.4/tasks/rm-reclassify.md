# Reclassifying files and records

You can edit classification details as well as reclassifying files and records to downgrade, upgrade, and declassify them.

When a file or record is originally classified, a downgrade or declassification schedule can be set up. It's recommended that you follow this schedule when reclassifying.

You also can't reclassify a file or record higher than your own security level. So if your security clearance is Confidential, you can't reclassify a file or record as Top Secret.

**Note:** Files and records can be reclassified multiple times.

1.  Hover over a file or record and select **More**, then **Edit Classification**.

2.  Select a classification from:

    -   **Top Secret**
    -   **Secret**
    -   **Confidential**
    -   **Unclassified**
    **Tip:** If you select unclassified then the file will be available to all users. The classification reason can be seen in its properties when you preview the file or record.

3.  You can edit most fields without choosing a new classification. If you select a new classification then you need to state who is doing the reclassification and the reason for doing it.

    **Note:** If the file or record has previously been reclassified then the person who classified it and their reason are displayed. You can edit these if required.

4.  Update any further fields as required and click **Save**.

    The file now displays its classification level, and can only be seen by those with the required security clearance. The Share option for the file is no longer available for Top Secret, Secret, or Confidential files. When a file is declared as a record it retains its classification level.
