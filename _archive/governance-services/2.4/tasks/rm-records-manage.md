    |**Download**|Download the file to your computer.|
    |**Edit Metadata**|Edit the metadata for the record.|

    |**Reviewed**|Marks a vital record as reviewed.|
    |**Reopen Record**|Revert the item back to an incomplete record.|

    When a record has been completed not all of these actions will be available.

    When the record is on hold \(identified by the ![Frozen](../images/ico-rm-frozen.png) icon\), a limited set of actions is available.

    Vital records display the ![Vital record](../images/ico-rm-vitalrecord.png) icon.


-   **[Viewing records](../tasks/rm-records-manage-view.md)**  
The record details page gives you access to the actions available to be performed on a record, the custom metadata, references to and from other records, and the record URL.
-   **[Linking records](../tasks/rm-records-manage-link.md)**  
You can link records to a folder other than the one they're filed in to file them in multiple locations in the File Plan.
-   **[Creating relationships between records](../tasks/rm-records-manage-reference.md)**  
You can add relationships to records to create a connection between them. This can be useful, for example, to track records that have been superseded or obsoleted.
-   **[Reviewing vital records](../tasks/rm-records-manage-review.md)**  
If you've set up a review period for vital records in the record category or folder, you can review this for individual records.
-   **[Managing unfiled records](../concepts/rm-records-manage-unfiled.md)**  
All records filed from a non-Records Management site are added to the Unfiled Records area by default.
-   **[Completing record events](../tasks/rm-records-manage-events.md)**  
If a disposition schedule has event-based steps, then you need to complete those events before the schedule can move on to the next step. Some steps are automatically completed but most of them you need to complete manually.
-   **[Editing a review date](../tasks/rm-records-manage-editdate.md)**  
If you've set up a review period for vital records in the record category or folder, you can edit the review date for individual records.
-   **[Editing a record disposition date](../tasks/rm-records-manage-dispdate.md)**  
If a record is subject to a record level disposition schedule, you can review the disposition date for the next step in the disposition schedule that applies to the record. This is done at record level only and does not affect the disposition schedule.
-   **[Processing records](../tasks/rm-dispsched-actions.md)**  
Disposition steps are generally completed manually, though retain and cut off steps can be completed automatically by a system process that is run daily. You can also set up a rule to complete steps automatically.
-   **[Adding records to a hold](../tasks/rm-records-manage-freeze.md)**  
Users with the appropriate capabilities can add records and folders to a hold.
-   **[Reverting a record to be an incomplete record](../tasks/rm-records-manage-reopen.md)**  
If you need to stop a record from being subject to disposition schedules, you can reopen it so that it reverts to being an incomplete record.
-   **[Deleting records](../tasks/rm-records-manage-delete.md)**  
When you don't need a record any more you can delete it.
