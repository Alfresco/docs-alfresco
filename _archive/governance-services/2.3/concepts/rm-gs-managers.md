# QuickStart for Records Managers

As a Records Manager you're responsible for ensuring the Alfresco Records Management site is properly organized and managed.

The background configuration of the site should be managed by your Records Management administrator in the RM Admin Tools.

This leaves you to get on with managing the site organization, devising and ensuring the implementation of retention and disposal schedules, and enabling appropriate access to information.

In this QuickStart guide you'll see how to get started with the basics immediately.

-   **[Adding a record category](../tasks/rm-recordcategory-add.md)**  
You can create a record category at the top level in the File Plan or within another record category.
-   **[Creating a disposition schedule](../tasks/rm-dispschedule-create.md)**  
A disposition schedule is created against and associated with a record category. First you create a summary of the schedule, then the steps in the schedule.
-   **[Creating disposition schedule steps](../tasks/rm-dispschedule-createsteps.md)**  
When you've set up a disposition schedule, you need to add disposition steps. The steps give the disposition schedule it's control over records and folders.
-   **[Adding a record folder](../tasks/rm-recordfolder-add.md)**  
You can add record folders within a record category.
-   **[Setting user permissions](../tasks/rm-set-permissions.md)**  
Setting user permissions on folders and categories lets you control who can see and work in different areas of the File Plan.
