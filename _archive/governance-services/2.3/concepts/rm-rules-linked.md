# Working with linked rules

When a category or folder has linked rules there are less editing options than when it has its own set of rules. You can either link to a different rule set or you can break the link completely.

When you select the **Manage Rules** action for a category or folder with linked rules, the Rules page shows the name and path of the category/folder whose rule set is being referenced.

**Note:** The category/folder might also inherit rules from a parent category/folder. A message lets you know if this is the case.

Changes to the rule set have to be done in the category/folder where the rules were originally defined. It's easy to get to the Rules page for the source category/folder: just click **View Rule Set**.

-   **[Linking to a different rule set](../tasks/rm-rules-change-link.md)**  
If you want to change the rules you're linked to, you can easily link to a different rule set.
-   **[Breaking the link to a rule set](../tasks/rm-rules-break-link.md)**  
If you don't need your rules anymore, breaking the link is easy. This leaves the category/folder without any rules.
