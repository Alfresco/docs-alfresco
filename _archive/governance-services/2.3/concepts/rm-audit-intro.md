# Audit

The Audit tool is used for external audits to demonstrate compliance to regulatory requirements, and for internal audits for process improvement.

It displays auditing information collected from the system to show whether business rules are being followed, and to ensure that any unauthorized activity can be identified and traced. This tool is especially important for systems that deal with classified information.

The Audit tool maintains a complete trace of all the actions on every record and cannot be altered. The information that is captured and stored includes:

-   Any action on any record, folder, category, or the File Plan
-   The user who carried out the action
-   The date and time of the action

The Audit tool displays by default when you access the RM Admin Tools.

-   **[Running an audit](../tasks/rm-audit-access.md)**  
The Audit tool displays by default when you open the Records Management Console.
-   **[What's in an audit](../concepts/rm-audit-actions.md)**  
When you run an audit, you are provided with details of all the actions that have taken place in your Records Management site.
-   **[Stopping and starting the audit log](../tasks/rm-audit-startstop.md)**  
If you have an audit running then you can stop it and restart it later.
-   **[Filing the audit log as a record](../tasks/rm-audit-filerecord.md)**

-   **[Exporting the audit log](../tasks/rm-audit-export.md)**

You can view the full contents of the log file in a separate window. From there you can save an HTML version of the report on your computer or in the Records Management File Plan.
-   **[Clearing the audit log](../tasks/rm-audit-clear.md)**  
If you've run an audit you can quickly clear it to delete all captured actions.
