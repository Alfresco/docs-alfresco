# Searching for text

To search for a simple text string in any record content, enter the text string.

For example, to find the text “healthcare” in any completed record:

1.  Type `healthcare` in the **Query Text** box.

2.  In the **Results options** section, select the components you want to search.

    To find a simple text string in any record name, title, description, or content, enter the following in the Query Text box:

    `keywords:healthcare`

    The keywords field is a special field name that allows you to match against the name, title, description, and content of a record.

    The basic syntax for matching against a field in search queries is the syntax format of the keywords field, then the colon \(:\), followed by the value to match against.
