# Filing a report

Whenever a record or folder is transferred, added to a hold, accessioned, or destroyed, you can file a report to keep a record of the process.

When you file a report it's filed as a record which you can then complete and process as with any other record.

1.  In the File Plan hover over a destroyed folder or record, or a folder or record awaiting transfer or accession completion, and click **File Report**.

    **Note:** Records and folders waiting for transfer and accession completion are stored by default in the **Transfers** area in the explorer panel. Records on a hold are stored by default in the **Holds** area in the explorer panel.

2.  Reports are filed by default to the **Unfiled Records** area of the File Plan. To select an alternate location deselect the **File report to 'Unfiled Records'** option and choose a different destination folder.

    **Note:** As with all records you must select a folder, not a category, to file the report to.

3.  Click **File Report**.


The report is filed as an incomplete record in your selected destination.
