# Filing an unfiled record

When you've declared a record from a non-Records Management site it's added to the Unfiled Records area. You now need to add it to a records folder.

1.  Click the **Unfiled Records** area on the explorer panel on the left of the page.

    All unfiled records are displayed.

    **Note:** You can add additional folders to the **Unfiled Records** area to create a folder hierarchy to help manage unfiled records. You can also declare items as records directly from within the **Unfiled Records** area structure.

2.  Hover over an unfiled record and click **More** then **File to...**.

3.  Select a records folder to file the record in then click **File**.

    **Note:** There are multiple other actions available including **Reject** so you can reject the record from the File Plan, and **Move to** so you can move the record to another location in the Unfiled Records hierarchy.


The record's added to the File Plan, and if you haven't already you can now go and edit metadata.
