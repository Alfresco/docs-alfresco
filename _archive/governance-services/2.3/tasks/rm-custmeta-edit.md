# Editing custom metadata

You can easily edit any custom metadata that you've set up.

1.  Click **Custom Metadata** in the RM Admin Tools.

2.  Select an option in the Object column: **Non-Electronic Document**, **Record**, **Record Category**, or **Record Folder**.

    The right column lists any custom metadata that's already been defined for the selected object.

3.  Click **Edit** to the right of the metadata you want to work with.

    The Edit Metadata Property page displays.

4.  Make the required changes then click **Save**.

    **Note:** You can't edit the type \(text, boolean or date\) or the Mandatory option for existing custom metadata.
