# Searching for exact term

To search for exact terms, prefix the term with an equals symbol \(`=`\). An example of exact term matching is to match the word “part”.

1.  In the **Query Text** box, enter:

    `=part`

2.  In the **Results options** section, select the components you want to search.


This search will match "part" but will not match other terms that contain "part", such as "partners".
