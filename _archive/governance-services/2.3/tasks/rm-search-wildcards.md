# Search using wildcards

An example of a simple wildcard query is to match any word starting with 'health' in any record name, title, description, or content.

1.  In the **Query Text** box, enter:

    `keywords:health*`

2.  In the **Results options** section, select the components you want to search..


The single and multiple wildcard characters can be combined as needed. For example, "\*care" and "\*car?" both match "healthcare".
