# Searching for empty strings

An example of searching for empty strings is to match all the empty Location fields.

1.  In the **Query Text** box, enter:

    `location:””`

2.  In the **Results options** section, select the check box for **Show Records \(Completed only\)** and deselect the other component options.

3.  Click **Search**.


The Results tab shows the completed records that have empty Location fields.
