# Alfresco Records Management

Alfresco Records Management controls important information that needs to be retained over time. It's used in highly regulated environments, for managing governmental information or personnel records, or where information might be audited.

Fully integrated into Alfresco, Records Management makes it easy to work with files and have them declared as records at the right time, without changing the way you work.
