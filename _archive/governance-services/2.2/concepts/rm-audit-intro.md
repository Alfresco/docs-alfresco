# Audit

The Audit tool is used for external audits to demonstrate compliance to regulatory requirements, and for internal audits for process improvement.

It displays auditing information collected from the system to show whether business rules are being followed, and to ensure that any unauthorized activity can be identified and traced. This tool is especially important for systems that deal with classified information.

The Audit tool maintains a complete trace of all the actions on every record and cannot be altered. The information that is captured and stored includes:

-   Any action on any record, folder, category, or the File Plan
-   The user who carried out the action
-   The date and time of the action

The Audit tool displays by default when you access the Records Management Console.
