# Searching records

You can use the Records Search to quickly search the File Plan to find records, and save your search query to use again.

You can either do a basic search, just searching for a term as you would in a search engine, or you can use the advanced search functionality. There's lots of options available for you to set really specific searches that you can use again and again. See [Advanced search options](rm-search-syntax.md) for more details on getting the most out of the search tool.

As well as basic searches where you search for a specific word, you can also create more complex full text searches with multiple matches, tokens, phrases, wildcards, ranges, and grouping.
