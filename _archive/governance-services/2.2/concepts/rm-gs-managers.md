# QuickStart for Records Managers

As a Records Manager you're responsible for ensuring the Alfresco Records Management site is properly organized and managed.

The background configuration of the site should be managed by your Records Management administrator in the Records Management Console.

This leaves you to get on with managing the site organization, devising and ensuring the implementation of retention and disposal schedules, and enabling appropriate access to information.

In this QuickStart guide you'll see how to get started with the basics immediately.
