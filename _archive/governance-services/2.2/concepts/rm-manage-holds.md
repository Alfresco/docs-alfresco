# Managing records holds

You can add records and folders to a hold to freeze them and suspend their retention schedules.

You can create as many different holds as you want, which are represented as folders in the Holds area.

**Tip:** Access the Holds area using the explorer panel to the left of the File Plan.

In the Holds area there's a **New Hold** option which you use to set up your different hold types. Once you have a list of different holds you can put [records](../tasks/rm-records-manage-freeze.md) and [record folders](../tasks/rm-recordfolder-freeze.md) on as many of the different holds as required.

You can also add records to a hold direct from the [Records Search](../tasks/rm-search-addhold.md).

When you add a folder to a hold, all records within the folder are also added to the hold. They'll stay on hold until removed from the hold or the hold is deleted.

In the Holds area you can look through your Holds and when you go into a hold you can see the records that are on it. The records aren't removed from the File Plan though. They retain their place in the File Plan with limited actions available, and are identified as being on hold by the ![Frozen](../images/ico-rm-frozen.png) icon.

**Note:** Only users with permissions to view a hold will see the ![Frozen](../images/ico-rm-frozen.png) icon next to records in the File Plan that are on that hold. Users without permission to view the hold will see the record but have no indication that it is on a hold. This provides confidentially on record holds.

You can use the **Manage Permissions** option to control which users can view, create, edit, and delete holds. Users who don't have read permission for a specific hold will not receive any indication that records it contains are in that hold.

**Tip:** You can hover over a hold and click **Generate Hold Report** to create a report on the hold. The report is filed as an incomplete record in your selected destination.
