# Exporting and importing File Plan content

You can quickly and easily import and export Records Management content, from individual record folders through to an entire File Plan.

This can be useful if you want to quickly build your File Plan, or parts of it, based on a File Plan that already exists on an Alfresco system.

You can move entire blocks of content – record categories, record folders, records, metadata, and disposition schedules – within a File Plan or to another File Plan.

Files are imported and exported using the Alfresco Content Package \(ACP\) format. You can also choose to import and export the content as a zip file. Exported files contain all structural information including record categories, folders, and disposition schedules, so they make for seamless building of a File Plan in another Alfresco system.
