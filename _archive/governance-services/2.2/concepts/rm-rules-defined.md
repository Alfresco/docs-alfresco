# Working with a set of rules

You can easily view and maintain the individual rules that makes up the rule set. You can add, edit, and delete rules, make a rule inactive, and change the run order. You can also manually run rules.

You can create many rules to form a full set of rules, and then apply multiple rules to categories and folders.

When you select the **Manage Rules** action for a category/folder with defined rules, the Rules page is split into two.

The left side of the page lists the rules that make up the rule set. If the category/folder inherits rules from a parent category/folder, those rules appear here too. The rules run in the order they're listed. Inherited rules are always run first.

A check mark to the left of the rule means it's active.

Selecting an individual rule in this list displays its details on the right side of the page.
