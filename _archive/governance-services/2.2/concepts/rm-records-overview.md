# Filing Records

Filing records is the process of classifying records and putting them into the correct location in the File Plan.

There are three ways that you can create records:

-   Create a record by uploading files
-   Create a non-electronic record that references a physical record such as a paper record or microfilm
-   Select an item in another Alfresco site \(non-Records Management\) and declare it as a record

**Note:** You can also import folders, categories, and even entire File Plans, and any records that they contain, see [Exporting and importing File Plan content](rm-export-import.md).

Your Alfresco administrator can also set up your system so that emails to specified addresses are captured and stored as records

A record is not considered to be complete until all the required metadata has been added to it. You select **Edit Metadata** to complete required metadata.

In DoD 5015.2-STD compliant Records Management sites you can also select to **Add Record Metadata** and associate the file with a record type, so that when you edit metadata there is type-specific metadata to add.

Once that's done you can select to **Complete Record** and it will be subject to the disposition rules that apply to the folder you've placed it in.

**Note:** When you set up a record category or folder you can specify that it will be used to hold **Vital Records**. A vital record must be reviewed on a periodic basis, as defined on the record category or folder.
