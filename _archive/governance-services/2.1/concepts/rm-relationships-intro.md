# Relationships

On a record details page you can create references to other records. Each reference is defined by a relationship.

There are two types of relationships that can be established between records:

-   Bi-directional - a two-way relationship such as a cross-reference
-   Parent/Child - a relationship where the child is dependant upon its parent, such as when the parent is superseded by the the child

The names given to individual relationships are based on the different types of referencing, and are what makes each one unique.

In the Relationships tool you can see the default relationship types that are included in Records Management and you can create new and manage existing relationships.

-   **[Creating a new relationship](../tasks/rm-relationships-create.md)**  
The Records Management Console has several default relationships. You can add more relationships, but once you create a relationship you can't delete it.
-   **[Editing a relationship](../tasks/rm-relationships-edit.md)**  
You can't delete relationships once they're created, but you can edit them.
