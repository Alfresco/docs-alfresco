# Filing Records

Filing records is the process of classifying records and putting them into the correct location in the File Plan.

There are three ways that you can create records:

-   Create a record by uploading files
-   Create a non-electronic record that references a physical record such as a paper record or microfilm
-   Select an item in another Alfresco site \(non-Records Management\) and declare it as a record

**Note:** You can also import folders, categories, and even entire File Plans, and any records that they contain, see [Exporting and importing File Plan content](rm-export-import.md).

Your Alfresco administrator can also set up your system so that emails to specified addresses are captured and stored as records

A record is not considered to be complete until all the required metadata has been added to it. You select **Edit Metadata** to complete required metadata. You can also select to **Add Record Metadata** and associate the file with a record type, so that when you edit metadata there is type-specific metadata to add. Once that's done you can select to **Complete Record** and it will be subject to the disposition rules that apply to the folder you've placed it in.

**Note:** When you set up a record category or folder you can specify that it will be used to hold **Vital Records**. A vital record must be reviewed on a periodic basis, as defined on the record category or folder.

-   **[Filing an electronic record](../tasks/rm-electronic-file.md)**  
Electronic records are files that are uploaded to a records folder.
-   **[Filing a non-electronic record](../tasks/rm-nonelect-file.md)**  
Non-electronic records might be paper files that can be stored in a physical location. Filing a non-electronic record in the File Plan means the file can be traced and details of where it is physically stored can be recorded.
-   **[Declaring a record from an external location](../tasks/rm-create-record.md)**  
You can create records from non-Records Management sites and add them straight into the File Plan.
-   **[Filing an unfiled record](../tasks/rm-file-unfiled.md)**  
When you've declared a record from a non-Records Management site it's added to the Unfiled Records folder. You now need to add it to a records folder.
-   **[Adding record metadata](../tasks/rm-metadata-add.md)**  
All records in the File Plan have metadata, which you can think of as a records properties.
-   **[Editing record metadata](../tasks/rm-metadata-edit.md)**  
Before you can complete a record, you must enter the required details about the record in the metadata. Completed metadata is mandatory for filing records in the File Plan.
-   **[Requesting record information](../tasks/rm-records-manage-requestinfo.md)**  
If you need additional information to complete a record, you can request this from other users.
-   **[Completing a record](../tasks/rm-record-declare.md)**  
Content added to the File Plan must be set to complete before it is recognized as a record.
