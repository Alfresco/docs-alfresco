# Custom metadata

Records Management has default sets of metadata for records, record categories, record folders, and non-electronic documents.

You can also add custom metadata that you can associate with each of these different types of records management objects.

You can choose from text fields, date pickers, check boxes, and if you've set up a [list of values](rm-lov-intro.md), drop-down selection menus.

If required you can choose to make specific custom data mandatory, so that users have to include it when they are completing a record.

**Note:** If you add mandatory metadata to a records management object type that already has existing instances, the newly mandatory metadata won't be applied to existing instances, as this could cause inconsistencies with the File Plan.

-   **[Creating custom metadata](../tasks/rm-custmeta-create.md)**  
You can create custom metadata for record categories, record folders, records, and non-electronic documents. Once you create custom metadata, you can't delete it.
-   **[Editing custom metadata](../tasks/rm-custmeta-edit.md)**  
You can easily edit any custom metadata that you've set up.
