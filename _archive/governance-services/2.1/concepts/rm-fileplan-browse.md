# Browsing the File Plan

The File Plan consists of an explorer panel and a content list.

The explorer panel has the following sections:

-   **Navigation**

    A tree view of the records management hierarchy. The ![](../images/Subfolders.png) icon indicates a category contains subfolders. Click the icon to view its contents.

-   **File Plan**

    A list of transition types that records can be in. You can click these to view all matching records.

-   **Saved Searches**

    A list of the saved searches. You can click these to view all matching records.


The location path above the content list shows your current position in the File Plan hierarchy. Each location path item is a link so you can easily return to any part of the current navigation path. Click ![Navigate Up](../images/navigate-up-icon.png) to display the contents of the folder one level higher.

Use the sort menu to change the criteria used to sort the File Plan contents. You can toggle between ascending and descending sort order.
