# Searching records

You can quickly search the File Plan to find records that you need and save your search query to use again.

You can either do a basic search, just searching for a term as you would in a search engine, or you can use the advanced search functionality. There's lots of options available for you to set really specific searches that you can use again and again. See [Advanced search options](rm-search-syntax.md) for more details on getting the most out of the search tool.

-   **[Accessing the Records Search](../tasks/rm-search-access.md)**  
You can search records to find those that you're looking for, and save searches for future use.
-   **[Creating a search](../tasks/rm-search-create.md)**  
You can search all the contents of your Records Management site. You can narrow the results of your search by specifying relevant metadata fields and container types \(category, folder, record\). Once you create a search, you can save it to use again.
-   **[Using a saved search](../tasks/rm-search-saved.md)**  
The Records Management site includes a number of default searches that you can use instead of creating your own. You also have access to searches you've created and saved yourself, as well as those created by other users.
-   **[Saving a search](../tasks/rm-search-save.md)**  
When you've run a search and are looking at the search results, you can select to save it.
-   **[Printing search results](../tasks/rm-search-print.md)**  
You can print the search results.
-   **[Exporting search results](../tasks/rm-search-export.md)**  
You can export search results as an Alfresco Content Package \(ACP\).
-   **[Deleting a saved search](../tasks/rm-search-saved-delete.md)**  
You can delete any of your own saved searches, and if you have the required user permissions you can also delete the default searches included with the Records Management site.
-   **[Advanced search options](../concepts/rm-search-syntax.md)**  
As well as basic searches where you search for a specific word, you can also create more complex full text searches with multiple matches, tokens, phrases, wildcards, ranges, and grouping.
