# Events

The life cycle of a record is controlled by either time-based or event-based triggers that are set in the disposition schedule. You can edit events and create entirely new ones.

Events are triggered when actions occur on a record or folder, such as it being versioned, cut off, closed, superseded, or obsoleted. All events belong to one of the following event types:

-   Simple - a standard Records Management event
-   Obsoleted - an item is invalid or out of date and is generally not replaced
-   Superseded - an item is invalid or out of date and is to be replaced with a current record
-   Cross Referenced Record Transferred - a record that is cross referenced is transferred

The following default events are available in Records Management:

-   Abolished - Simple
-   All Allowances Granted Are Terminated - Simple
-   Case Closed - Simple
-   Case Complete - Simple
-   No longer needed - Simple
-   Obsolete - Obsoleted
-   Redesignated - Simple
-   Related Record Transferred to Inactive Storage - Cross Referenced Record Transferred
-   Separation - Simple
-   Study Complete - Simple
-   Superseded - Superseded
-   Training Complete - Simple
-   WGI action complete - Simple
