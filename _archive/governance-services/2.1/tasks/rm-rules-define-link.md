# Linking to an existing rule set

The **Link to Rule Set** option lets you reuse an existing rule set that's already defined for another category or folder.

**Note:** If a category or folder already has linked rules applied \(indicated by the ![](../images/rules-icon.png) icon\) you can link to new rules by [linking to a different rule set](rm-rules-change-link.md).

1.  Hover over a category/folder with no rules applied and click **More** then **Manage Rules**.

2.  Click **Link to Rule Set**.

3.  Find the category/folder you want to use.

    Select the site then select a folder. Check the rules listed to make sure you're linking to the correct folder.

    **Note:** Locations that you don't have permission to access are disabled.

4.  Click **Link**.

    **Note:** You can click **View Rule Set** to view the rule details, or **Change** to select a different rule to link to.

5.  Click **Done**.
