You can delete any of your own saved searches, and if you have the required user permissions you can also delete the default searches included with the Records Management site.

1.  Click the **Saved Searches** menu on the **Search** page to view the available search queries.

2.  Select the query you want to delete.

    The **Critera** tab is displayed so you can check that this is the search you want to delete.

3.  Click **Delete Search**.

4.  Click **Remove** to confirm the deletion.
