# Managing records

There are various options available to help you manage record. These are available to users with the appropriate capabilities.

1.  In the File Plan hover over a record to display the available actions. The standard actions available are shown below. Additional options are available dependant on the stage a record is at in the disposition schedule. See the relevant topics for further details.

    |Action|Select this to...|
    |------|-----------------|
    |Download|Download the file to your computer.|
    |Edit Metadata|Edit the metadata for the record.|
    |Complete Record|Declare the file as a record. All required metadata fields must be complete. When you declare the file as a record, this action toggles to the **Reopen Record** action.|
    |Reviewed|Marks a vital record as reviewed.|
    |Reopen Record|Revert the item back to an incomplete record.|
    |Add Record Metadata|Associate an undeclared record with one or more record types.|
    |Freeze|Freeze the record. You can view frozen records in the **Holds** area on the explorer panel. When you freeze the record, this action toggles to the **Unfreeze** action.|
    |Copy to|Create a copy of the record in another location in the File Plan.|
    |Move to|Move the record to another location in the File Plan.|
    |Link to|File a record in multiple locations in the File Plan and create a link. This gives the appearance of duplicating the record in another location, though actually there is just one record stored in multiple folders. Changes made to the record in one location will be reflected in the other locations.|
    |Delete|Delete the record from the File Plan.|
    |View Audit Log|View the auditing information for this record. The Audit Log displays the activity information in a new window and has options to export or file this information as a record.|
    |Request Information|Request further information about a record from other users. This is only available for incomplete records.|

    When a record has been completed not all of these actions will be available.

    When the record is frozen \(identified by the ![Frozen](../images/ico-rm-frozen.png) icon\), a limited set of actions is available.

    Vital records display the ![Vital record](../images/ico-rm-vitalrecord.png) icon.


-   **[Viewing records](../tasks/rm-records-manage-view.md)**  
The record details page gives you access to the actions available to be performed on a record, the custom metadata, references to and from other records, and the record URL.
-   **[Linking records](../tasks/rm-records-manage-link.md)**  
You can link records to file them in multiple locations in the File Plan.
-   **[Referencing records](../tasks/rm-records-manage-reference.md)**  
You can reference records to create a connection between them. This can be useful, for example, to track records that have been superseded or obsoleted.
-   **[Reviewing vital records](../tasks/rm-records-manage-review.md)**  
If you've set up a review period for vital records in the record category or folder, you can review this for individual records.
-   **[Completing record events](../tasks/rm-records-manage-events.md)**  
If a disposition schedule has event-based steps, then you need to complete those events before the schedule can move on to the next step. Some steps are automatically completed but most of them you need to complete manually.
-   **[Editing a review date](../tasks/rm-records-manage-editdate.md)**  
If you've set up a review period for vital records in the record category or folder, you can edit the review date for individual records.
-   **[Editing a record disposition date](../tasks/rm-records-manage-dispdate.md)**  
If a record is subject to a record level disposition schedule, you can review the disposition date for the next step in the disposition schedule that applies to the record. This is done at record level only and does not affect the disposition schedule.
-   **[Processing records](../tasks/rm-dispsched-actions.md)**  
Disposition steps are generally completed manually, though retain and cut off steps can be completed automatically by a system process that is run daily. You can also set up a rule to complete steps automatically.
-   **[Freezing records](../tasks/rm-records-manage-freeze.md)**  
Users with the appropriate capabilities can freeze records and folders. This places a hold on the record or folder. A hold allows objects frozen for a particular reason to be tracked as a set. Holds prevent changes to frozen objects, which have their retention schedules suspended until the hold is removed. When you freeze a folder, all records within the folder are also frozen.
-   **[Reverting a record to be an incomplete record](../tasks/rm-records-manage-reopen.md)**  
If you need to stop a record from being subject to disposition schedules, you can reopen it so that it reverts to being an incomplete record.
-   **[Deleting records](../tasks/rm-records-manage-delete.md)**  
When you don't need a record any more you can delete it.
