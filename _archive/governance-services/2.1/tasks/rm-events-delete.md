# Deleting an event

You can delete all events, whether they are system defaults or ones that you've created.

**Note:** It's recommended that you don't delete events that are actively in use on your system.

1.  Click **Events** in the Records Management Console.

2.  Browse the list to find the event you want to delete.

3.  Click **Delete**.

    A message prompts you to confirm the deletion.

4.  Click **Yes**.

    The event is deleted from the Events page.
