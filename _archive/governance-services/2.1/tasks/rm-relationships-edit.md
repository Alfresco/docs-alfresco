# Editing a relationship

You can't delete relationships once they're created, but you can edit them.

1.  Click **Relationships** in the Records Management Console.

2.  Locate the relationship you want to modify, and then click **Edit**.

    The Edit Relationship page displays. You can't change the relationship type; only the field values can be modified.

3.  Make the necessary changes:

    -   If the relationship type is Bi-directional, edit the Label field.
    -   If the relationship type is Parent/Child, edit the Source and Target fields.
4.  Click **Save**.
