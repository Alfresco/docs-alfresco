# Opening the Records Management Console

You can easily configure Records Management using the Records Management Console.

**Note:** The user who created the Records Management site is automatically made a member of the Records Management Administrator group. Other users can access different areas of the **Records Management Console** depending on the capabilities given to the role that they're in.

1.  In a Records Management site click the **More** menu.

2.  Click **Records Management Console**.

    The **Records Management Console** opens on the **Audit** page, with various tools available on the left side of the page. Click a tool to manage that part of your site.
