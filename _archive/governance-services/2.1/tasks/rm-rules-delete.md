# Deleting a rule

When a category or folder has a rule applied that you don't need anymore, you can delete the individual rule.

1.  Click **Manage Rules** when you're in the folder or category in the File Plan you want to delete rules for.

    **Tip:** You can also hover over a category/folder with rules applied \(indicated by the ![](../images/rules-icon.png) icon\) and click **More** then **Manage Rules**.

2.  On the left side of the page, click the rule you want to delete.

    If you might want to use the rule again, consider disabling it instead. Edit the rule to do that.

    **Note:** You can't delete linked or inherited rules here; that has to be done in the folder where they were created.

3.  Click **Delete**.

4.  When you're asked to confirm the deletion, click **Delete**.
