# Importing content

Importing an Alfresco Content Package \(ACP\) or ZIP file into a Records Management system expands the package to its original structure. Existing content will not be overwritten.

1.  Go to the level in the File Plan structure where you want to import the ACP/ZIP file.

2.  Click **Import**.

3.  Click **Select import file** and find the file that you want to upload.

    **Important:** You should only import an ACP/ZIP file that was exported from another Records Management File Plan.

    The Records Management content is extracted from the uploaded file with it's original structure maintained.
