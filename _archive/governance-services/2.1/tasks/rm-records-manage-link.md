# Linking records

You can link records to file them in multiple locations in the File Plan.

This gives the effect of "duplicating" the record in another location, though there is still only one record, but it's now contained in more than one folder. Changes made to the record in one location will be reflected in all the other locations, and this includes deleting the record.

1.  Hover over a record in the File Plan and click **More** then **Link to**.

2.  Select a location in the File Plan to link a record to.

3.  Click **Link**.

    A link is created in the destination folder. All versions of the document display the ![Linked](../images/ico-rm-linkedrecord.png) icon.

    **Note:** The rules of all disposition schedules that a record is governed by are combined, with the longest retention period being the one that is adhered to.
