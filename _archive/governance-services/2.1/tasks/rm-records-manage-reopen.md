# Reverting a record to be an incomplete record

If you need to stop a record from being subject to disposition schedules, you can reopen it so that it reverts to being an incomplete record.

1.  Hover over a record in the File Plan and click **More** then **Reopen**.

    The record is now marked as an incomplete record in the file plan and is not subject to the rules of the disposition schedule. You can set it to complete again whenever needed.
