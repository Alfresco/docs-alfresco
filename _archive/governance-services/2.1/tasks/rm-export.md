# Exporting content

Exporting a records category or folder bundles the contents and structure into an Alfresco Content Package \(ACP\). You can also choose to export the content as a ZIP file.

1.  In the File Plan click the check boxes for the record category and/or folders you want to export.

2.  Click **Selected Items** then **Export**.

3.  Select the file format for the export and click **OK**.

    **Note:** A zip file retains the file structure, making it bigger than an ACP. In an ACP the file structure is stored in an xml file.

    Depending on your browser, you are either prompted to specify a destination or the file is automatically downloaded to a default location.
