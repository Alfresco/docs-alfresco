# Freezing records

Users with the appropriate capabilities can freeze records and folders. This places a hold on the record or folder. A hold allows objects frozen for a particular reason to be tracked as a set. Holds prevent changes to frozen objects, which have their retention schedules suspended until the hold is removed. When you freeze a folder, all records within the folder are also frozen.

1.  Hover over a record in the File Plan and click **More** then **Freeze**.

    The Reason for Freeze dialog box displays.

2.  Enter the reason you are freezing the record folder and click **Freeze Record\(s\)**.

    A message displays confirming that the record is frozen, and the record now displays the ![Frozen](../images/ico-rm-frozen.png) icon.


The record remains in its place in the File Plan. It is also shown in the **Holds** area of the explorer panel.
