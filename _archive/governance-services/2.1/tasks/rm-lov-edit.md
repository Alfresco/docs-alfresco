    1.  In the empty field at the top of the page, type the new value.

    2.  Click **Add**.

        The value name displays in the Values table.

    **Note:** You can click **Delete** next to a value to remove it from the list.

4.  To control the user and group access to the individual values in the list:

    1.  In the Values table, click the value you want to set access for.

        The selected value is highlighted.

    2.  On the right side of the page, click **Add**.

        The Add Access dialog box displays.

    3.  In the search field, type the full or partial name of a user or group.

        You must enter at least three \(3\) characters.

    4.  Click **Search**.

        A list of users and groups matching the search criteria displays.

    5.  Click **Add** to the right of the user or group you want to have access to the selected value.

        The user or group displays in the right column. You can add as many users and groups as required.

    **Note:** Only users that you give access to here will be able to see the value when they edit metadata.

5.  When you have finished editing the values and access, click **Done** to save all changes.
