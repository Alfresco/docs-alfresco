# Filing an electronic record

Electronic records are files that are uploaded to a records folder.

1.  In the record folder where you want to file a record click **File**.

2.  Click **Electronic**.

3.  Click **Select records to file** and find the file that you want to upload.

    **Tip:** You can drag and drop files directly from your computer onto the **Select records to file** box. You can also select multiple items in the standard multi-select way.

    New records display in the File Plan as incomplete records. You need to make sure all required metadata is added before you can set records to complete.
