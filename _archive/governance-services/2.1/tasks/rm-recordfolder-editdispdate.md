# Editing a folder disposition date

If a folder is subject to a folder level disposition schedule, you can review the disposition date for the next step in the disposition schedule that applies to the folder. This is done at folder level only and does not affect the disposition schedule.

1.  Hover over a folder in the File Plan and click **More** then **Edit Disposition Date**.

    The Edit Disposition Date dialog box displays. The current disposition date is highlighted.

2.  Select a new disposition date and click **Update**.

    A message displays confirming that the disposition date is updated. This overrules any review dates set in the disposition schedule.
