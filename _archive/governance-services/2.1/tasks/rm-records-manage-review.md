# Reviewing vital records

If you've set up a review period for vital records in the record category or folder, you can review this for individual records.

Users with Records Manager permissions receive a notification email when vital records are due for review.

1.  When a record is due for review hover over it in the File Plan.

    **Tip:** You can search for vital records using the **Records Search** on the **More** menu. Records that are due for review will display a warning symbol in the search results.

2.  Click **Reviewed**.

    A message displays saying that the record has been successfully reviewed. The review date is displayed in the record audit log.
