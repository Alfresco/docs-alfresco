# Referencing records

You can reference records to create a connection between them. This can be useful, for example, to track records that have been superseded or obsoleted.

1.  Click the title of a record in the File Plan.

    The record details page is displayed.

2.  Scroll down the page and click the ![Manage](../images/ico-configure.png) icon in the References section.

3.  Click **New Reference**.

4.  Enter a Reference name.

5.  Click **Select** and then navigate the File Plan to find a record to reference and click ![Add](../images/ico-add.png).

6.  Click **OK**.

7.  Select a relationship with the referenced record.

    **Note:** Most references do not alter or affect a record in any way, they are just used to create an association between records.

    However, if you select Obsoleted by/Obsoletes or Superseded by/Supersedes, then any outstanding disposition schedule obsoleted or superseded events will be automatically completed.

8.  Click **Create**.
