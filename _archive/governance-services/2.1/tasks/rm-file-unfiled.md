# Filing an unfiled record

When you've declared a record from a non-Records Management site it's added to the Unfiled Records folder. You now need to add it to a records folder.

1.  Click the **Unfiled Records** folder on the explorer panel on the left of the page.

    All unfiled records are displayed.

2.  Hover over an unfiled record and click **More** then **File to...**.

3.  Select a records folder to file the record in then click **File**.


The record's added to the File Plan, and if you haven't already you can now go and add the required metadata.
