# What's new in Alfresco Records Management

Alfresco Records Management has several new features for this release.

-   [Security controlled files and records](whats-new-rm.md#1)
-   [New feature naming](whats-new-rm.md#2)
-   [Configuration help](whats-new-rm.md#3)

**Security controlled files and records**

In this release we've added full security controls with a classification lifecyle. You can classify files and records and apply security controls, so that only users with the required security clearance can view or access them. As well as the predefined Classification control, you can set up security marks and security groups, so that content can be controlled as your organization needs. See [Security controls](../concepts/rm-security.md) for more.
