# Completing folder events

If a retention schedule has event-based steps, then you need to complete those events before the schedule can move on to the next step. Some steps are automatically completed but most of them you need to complete manually.

1.  Click the title of a folder in the File Plan.

    The record details page is displayed. All incomplete events for the current schedule step are displayed.

2.  Click **Complete Event**.

3.  In the complete Event box select a date and time for the completion of the event..

4.  Click **OK**.


When all incomplete events are complete the folder can move onto the next step in the schedule.
