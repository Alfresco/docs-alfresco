# Filing the audit log as a record

When you've run an audit log you then have the option to file it as a record.

1.  When you've run an audit, click **File as Record** in the Audit tool of the RM Admin Tools.

2.  Choose the destination folder for the audit record.

3.  Click **OK**.

    A message confirms that the audit log has been filed as a record in the selected folder in the File Plan.

    **Note:** You'll need to add any required metadata before the record can be completed.

4.  Click **OK** to dismiss the message. You can also click **View Record** to display the audit report in the Records Management site.
