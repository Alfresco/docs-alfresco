# Editing a record retention date

If a record is subject to a record level retention schedule, you can review the retention date for the next step in the retention schedule that applies to the record. This is done at record level only and does not affect the retention schedule.

1.  Hover over a record in the File Plan and click **More** then **Edit Retention Date**.

    The Edit Retention Date dialog box displays. The current retention date is highlighted.

2.  Select a new retention date and click **Update**.

    A message displays confirming that the retention date is updated. This overrules any review dates set in the retention schedule, even if you update the retention schedule.
