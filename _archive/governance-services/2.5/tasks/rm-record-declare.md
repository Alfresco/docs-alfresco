# Completing a record

Content added to the File Plan must be set to complete before it is recognized as a record.

1.  Hover over an incomplete record in the File Plan and click **Complete Record**.

    **Tip:** Incomplete records are marked.

    If a record has mandatory metadata that hasn't been completed then a message lets you know that required metadata is missing.


Once a record is completed, it comes under the control of the record category it is filed under, and security restrictions apply.

**Note:** A record can be filed in multiple categories, see [Linking records](rm-records-manage-link.md) for more details.
