# Deleting records

When you don't need a record any more you can delete it.

1.  Hover over a record in the File Plan and click **Delete**.

    A confirmation dialog box displays.

2.  Click **Delete**.

    The record is removed from the Records Management system. If the record was declared from a file in an Alfresco site then the file is also removed.
