# Adding a record category

You can create a record category at the top level in the File Plan or within another record category.

1.  In the File Plan go to the location for the new record category.

2.  Click **New Category**.

    The New Record Category dialog box displays.

3.  Enter details for the new category. Fields marked with an asterisk \(\*\) are required.

    |**Metadata field**|**Description**|
    |------------------|---------------|
    |**Name\***|The name for the record category.|
    |**Title\***|The title for the record category.|
    |**Description**|A description of the record category.|
    |**Record Category ID\***|A unique identifier for the record category is generated automatically. You can change this now, but you can't edit it once the category has been created.|
    |**Vital Record Indicator**|Defines whether records in this category have a review process. The Vital Record Indicator is applied to all record folders within that category. You can change this at folder level.Users with Records Manager permissions receive a notification email when vital records are due for review.

|
    |**Period**|The time period for the review cycle. Reviews are recurring based on the period you select. The review period is required when the **Vital Record Indicator** option is selected.**Note:** The "Quarter" option splits the year into 4 sets of 3 months, beginning with Jan/Feb/March. "Financial Quarter" is the same but based on the start date of your system-configured financial year.

The review period is displayed on the details page for folders and records in the category.

|
    |**Expression**|Enter a number as the **Expression** to accompany the **Period** type. If you enter “Week” and “3”, this would mean a review cycle of 3 weeks.If you select a Period that doesn't require an Expression then this field isn't available.

|

4.  Click **Save**.

    The new category displays in the File Plan.
