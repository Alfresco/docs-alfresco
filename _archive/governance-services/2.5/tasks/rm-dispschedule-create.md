# Creating a retention schedule

A retention schedule is created against and associated with a record category. First you create a summary of the schedule, then the steps in the schedule.

1.  Hover over a record category in the File Plan and click **View Details**.

    The category details page displays and if the category already has a retention schedule then you'll see the schedule summary and steps.

2.  Click **Create Retention Schedule**.

3.  In the **General** section, click **Edit**.

4.  Complete all fields:

    |Field|Description|
    |-----|-----------|
    |Retention Authority|The authority that states how the record should be retained and disposed, for example *Sarbanes-Oxley Act \(SOX\)* or *Corporate procedures*.|
    |Retention Instructions|A summary of the retention schedule.This information is not actively used but this text is displayed in the record category summary in the File Plan, and is important from a legal perspective.

|
    |Applied to|**Record Folder**: the retention schedule is applied to folders and all operations occur at the folder level. With this setting, you cannot manage records as individual units. If you cut off the folder, all records will be cut off. **Record**: the retention schedule is applied to records and all operations occur at the record level.

|

    **Note:** If you add folders to a category before setting up the retention schedule, then you can only select **Record Folder**.

5.  Click **Save**.

    The category details page now displays a summary of the new or updated retention schedule.


Next you need to add steps to the retention schedule.
