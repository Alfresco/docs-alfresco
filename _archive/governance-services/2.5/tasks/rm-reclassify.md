# Reclassifying files and records

You can edit classification details and change the assigned security marks, as well as reclassifying files and records to downgrade, upgrade, and declassify them.

When a file or record is originally classified, a downgrade or declassification schedule can be set up. It's recommended that you follow this schedule when reclassifying.

You also can't reclassify a file or record higher than your own security level. So if your security clearance is Confidential, you can't reclassify a file or record as Top Secret.

**Note:** Files and records can be reclassified multiple times.

1.  Hover over a file or record and select **More**, then **Edit Classification**.

2.  Select a classification from:

    -   **Top Secret**
    -   **Secret**
    -   **Confidential**
    -   **Unclassified**
    **Tip:** If you select unclassified then the file will be available to all users. The classification reason can be seen in its properties when you preview the file or record.

3.  You can edit most fields without choosing a new classification. If you select a new classification then you need to state who is doing the reclassification and the reason for doing it.

    **Note:** If the file or record has previously been reclassified then the person who classified it and their reason are displayed. You can edit these if required.

4.  Update other **Security Classification** details as required.

5.  Click security marks to apply them to the file or record, and again to remove them.

    See [How security controls work](../concepts/rm-sc-overview.md) for more details.

6.  Click **Save**.

    The file or record now displays its classification level, and can only be seen by those with the required security clearance.

    **Tip:** Files and records set to Unclassified with no applied security marks can be seen by all users.

    **Note:** The option to **Share** a file \(not applicable for records\) is no longer available for Top Secret, Secret, or Confidential files. When a file is declared as a record it retains its classification level and any security marks.

    The classification reason and classification-related properties can be seen in the **Properties** when you preview the file or record.
