# Security controls

With Records Management you can add security controls to files and records so that only users with the required security level can view or access them.

Security controls is the collective term for security classifications and security groups, which in turn are made up of one or more security marks.

There is one predefined **Classification** security group, and you have the option to add as many additional security groups as you need.

Both files and records can be classified using their **Classify** option to apply a security classification and security marks. When a file or record is classified it can only be seen by those with the required security clearance, and the security classification level is shown on screen. Users without the necessary security clearance won't have access to it or even know that it's there. When a classified file is declared as a record it retains its classification level and security marks.

User security clearance is set for a user \(or user group\) by assigning security marks to them.

**Tip:** Security controls are configured and assigned through the standard Alfresco Admin Tools, and can be used completely independently of a records management site if required.

-   **[Classification life cycle](../concepts/rm-classification-lifecycle.md)**  
Users with the required security clearance and file permissions can classify and reclassify both files and records.
-   **[How security controls work](../concepts/rm-sc-overview.md)**  
Both the predefined Classification security group and any custom security groups function in largely the same way, with a few important differences.
-   **[How security clearance works](../concepts/rm-clearance-overview.md)**  
Security clearance is the assignment of security marks to users.
-   **[Creating a security group](../tasks/rm-create-security-group.md)**  
Each security group is made up of one or more security marks.
-   **[Adding security marks to a security group](../tasks/rm-add-marks.md)**  
You can add multiple security marks to a security group.
-   **[Setting security clearance](../tasks/rm-assign-sc.md)**  
Alfresco Administrators can assign different clearance levels to users and groups to give access files and records within their clearance level.
-   **[Classifying a record](../tasks/rm-classify-record.md)**  
You can classify records and apply security marks so that they can only be viewed or accessed by users who have the required security clearance.
-   **[Reclassifying files and records](../tasks/rm-reclassify.md)**  
You can edit classification details and change the assigned security marks, as well as reclassifying files and records to downgrade, upgrade, and declassify them.
