# Using Records Management

With Alfresco Records Management you store and control all your records in a dedicated site. A Records Management site is like other Alfresco sites, but with additional controls placed on its content.

Access a Records Management site just as you would any other Alfresco site, from the My Sites dashlet or the Sites menu.

Instead of storing your files in a document library as you do in a "regular" Alfresco site, in a Records Management site you file your records in the **File Plan**. And you can't edit the content of records; once they're in the File Plan record content is considered to be final.

You file records by adding them from your computer to the File Plan, or if you're in another Alfresco site you can declare a file as a record and it will be added to the Records Management site. Once files are added to the File Plan you can edit their metadata \(properties\) but you can't edit their actual content.

If you're new to Alfresco then take a look at [Using Alfresco](http://docs.alfresco.com/5.2/topics/sh-uh-welcome.html) to help you get started.

For more details on setting up and administering Records Management see [Administering Records Management](rm-admin-intro.md).

**Note:** It's recommended that you use the File Plan for Records Management actions rather than going through the repository.

-   **[Life cycle of a record](../concepts/rm-record-lifecycle.md)**  
You can create a record either by uploading it to the Records Management File Plan, or by declaring a file in another Alfresco site as a record.
-   **[The File Plan](../concepts/rm-fileplan.md)**  
The File Plan is a container for records, folders, categories and retention schedules. It's effectively a virtual filing cabinet for storing records, and is the basic structure of Records Management. This structure lets you classify and group records with similar characteristics.
-   **[Retention schedules](../concepts/rm-dispschedule.md)**  
Retention schedules define how records are managed in the Records Management system until their eventual destruction or transfer to another location. The period between a record being completed and becoming part of the File Plan, and being destroyed/transferred is known as its retention period.
-   **[Managing permissions](../concepts/rm-manage-permissions.md)**  
To ensure the security of your Records Management system you can easily manage user permissions to control which users and groups can see and work in different sections of the File Plan.
-   **[Filing records](../concepts/rm-records-overview.md)**  
Filing records is the process of classifying records and putting them into the correct location in the File Plan.
-   **[Easy access records](../concepts/rm-easy-access.md)**  
In many cases you might want to create records from files that already exist in Alfresco, rather than creating a record from scratch.
-   **[Managing the File Plan](../concepts/rm-fileplan-manage.md)**  
The record categories, record folders, and records in the File Plan structure each have an appropriate set of actions. You can access the actions by hovering over an item in the File Plan or by clicking on an item name. Use these actions to manage the File Plan.
-   **[Automating the File Plan](../concepts/rm-rules.md)**  
In the File Plan you can define category and folder rules to manage your content automatically. You can come up with many creative solutions to make sure specific content processes are automated so you don't have to do the work yourself.
-   **[Searching records](../concepts/rm-search.md)**  
You can use the Records Search to quickly search the File Plan to find records, and save your search query to use again.
-   **[Auditing and reporting](../concepts/rm-auditing.md)**  
You can view audit logs for record categories, record folders, and records, and whenever a record or folder is transferred, added to a hold, accessioned, or destroyed, you can file a report to keep a record of the process.
-   **[Security controls](../concepts/rm-security.md)**  
With Records Management you can add security controls to files and records so that only users with the required security level can view or access them.
