# Records Management QuickStart

Although Alfresco Records Management has a huge amount of functionality available, it's actually pretty easy to learn the essentials and get up and running.

What you do in Records Management will vary hugely depending on your role, and how your company is organized. The QuickStart guide is split into two sections, one for Records Managers, and one for Records Management users. You might find that these guides don't exactly match what you do in your day-to-day job, but even if they don't you should find them useful in getting started, and in understanding the basic concepts of Records Management and how the processes fit together.

-   **[Life cycle of a record](../concepts/rm-record-lifecycle.md)**
