# Managing permissions

To ensure the security of your Records Management system you can easily manage user permissions to control which users and groups can see and work in different sections of the File Plan.

In Alfresco Records Management there are 2 different methods for managing what users can and can't do:

-   Roles and capabilities are managed by the Alfresco administrator, and control the actions users have within the File Plan, such as the ability to create record categories or record folders.
-   User permissions are managed at folder and category level, and control whether users can read and file or just read.

User permissions aren't granted by default. If a user hasn't been given permission to read a folder or category, then they won't see it in the File Plan. Only Records Management Administrators are granted access to all areas of the File Plan by default.

By managing your user permissions you can create restricted areas of the File Plan that are only available to selected users. For an area that all users should have access to, you need to make sure that all users have been given permission to see it.

-   **[Setting user permissions](../tasks/rm-set-permissions.md)**  
Setting user permissions on folders and categories lets you control who can see and work in different areas of the File Plan.
