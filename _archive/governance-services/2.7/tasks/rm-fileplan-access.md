# Opening the File Plan

You can use the File Plan to manage, view, and work with records.

1.  Click **File Plan** in the Records Management site.

    The records list takes up most of the File Plan main page. You can filter the records list and navigate the File Plan using the explorer panel down the left side of the page.

2.  Use the **Options** menu to select how you want to view the library content, and the sorting options to sort records.


**Note:** It's recommended that you use the File Plan for Records Management actions rather than going through the repository.
