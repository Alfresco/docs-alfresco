# Filing an electronic record

Electronic records are files that are uploaded to a records folder. Non-electronic records might be paper files that can be stored in a physical location.

1.  In the record folder where you want to file a record click **File**.

2.  Click **Electronic**.

3.  Click **Select Records to File** and find the file that you want to upload.

    **Tip:** You can also select multiple items in the standard multi-select way.

    The files are uploaded as record and display in the File Plan as incomplete records. You need to make sure any required metadata is added before you can set records to complete.
