# Saving a search

When you've run a search and are looking at the search results, you can select to save it.

1.  Click **Save Search**.

2.  Enter a **Name** and **Description** for the search.

3.  Click **Save**.

    The search you save will be available for all site members.


The saved search displays in the **Saved Searches** menu on the Search page. The same list is available in the explorer panel of the File Plan.

**Note:** The saved search feature saves only the search query and not the results. This means that when you next use the saved search, you might get different results, depending on the activity in the Records Management system.
