# Linking records

You can link records to a folder other than the one they're filed in to file them in multiple locations in the File Plan.

This gives the effect of "duplicating" the record in another location, though there is still only one record, but it's now contained in more than one folder. Changes made to the record in one location will be reflected in all the other locations, and this includes deleting the record.

**Important:** It's recommended that you don't link a record to a location where it will be subject to a retention schedule with different steps or a different sequence of steps.

**Note:** The link option is only available to users who have the Link Records capability assigned to them by the Records Management Administrator.

1.  Hover over a record in the File Plan and click **More** then **Link to**.

2.  Select a folder in the File Plan to link a record to.

3.  Click **Link**.

    A link is created in the destination folder. All copies of the record display the ![Linked](../images/ico-rm-linkedrecord.png) icon.

    **Note:** Linked records won't move to the next retention step until the period for the current step has been completed in all retention schedules it falls under. So in effect they follow the retention schedule that has the longest period for a step.


You can click **More** then **Unlink Record** against the record in the destination folder. This will remove the linked record from the destination folder.

**Note:** The unlink option is only available to users who have the Unlink Records capability assigned to them by the Records Management Administrator.
