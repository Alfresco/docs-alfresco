# Change Declassification Time Frame

The Declassification Time Frame screen is where you set the declassification period your system will use when declassifying items in Governance Services.

1.  Go to **Admin Tools** \> **Security Controls** \> **Configure** \> **Declassification Time Frame tab**.

    The **Calendar Icon** displays the current **Declassification Time Frame**.

2.  Select a new Declassification Time Frame from the drop down list and click **Save**.

3.  Click **Apply to Existing Items** if you want to change the Declassification Time Frame of items already in Governance Services.

    This process may take some to complete.
