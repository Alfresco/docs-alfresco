# Creating classification guides

Classification guides can be used to quickly classify content with a preset collection of security controls.

You can create an unlimited number of guides, and each one can contain one or more topics. Topics can then contain either subtopics or instructions.

Instructions are a collection of security marks and classification details. When you classify content with a topic \(or topics\) it's classification details are populated with those in the topic.

You can build up guides and they won't be available for use until you set them to **On**. Find out more in [How classification guides work](../concepts/rm-cg-overview.md).

1.  Click **Admin Tools** and then click **Security Controls \> Classification Guides**.

2.  Click **New Guide**.

3.  Enter a name for the guide.

4.  Enter an Originating Organization, for example, government or other body.

5.  Enter a guide publication date. This is the date when the guide should be made available.

6.  Select whether to make the guide available for classifying content.

    If it's not yet ready then you can leave it Off and switch in On at a later stage.

7.  Click **Save**.

    The guide is now listed and you can now add topics to it.

8.  Click on the guide name then click **New Topic**.

    **Tip:** You can click on a guide \(not the guide name\) then click ![Edit group](../images/ico-configure.png) to edit the guide, or ![Delete group](../images/ico-trashcan.png) to delete it.

9.  Enter a name and optional description for the topic.

    You can now click **Save** and add sub-topics, or select instructions to add to a topic.

10. To add instructions click on **Security Classifications** and/or **Security Groups**:

    -   **Security Classifications** - Select a classification level, a classification reason, and any other required classification details
    -   **Security Groups** - Select all the required security marks
11. Click **Save**.

    If the guide is switched **On** then users can select from the topics it contains to automatically classify content.

    **Note:** If you delete a guide containing instructions that are currently being used to classify content, then the content will retain its classification.

    If you edit a guide's instructions then that won't modify the classification level or marks applied to content previously classified using that instruction.
