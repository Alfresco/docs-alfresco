# Using a saved search

The Records Management site includes a number of default searches that you can use instead of creating your own. You also have access to searches you've created and saved yourself, as well as those created by other users.

1.  On the Records Search page click **Saved Searches** and select a search option.

    The **Critera** tab is auto-filled with the saved search options. You can change these if you want.

2.  Click **Search**.

    The search results display in a table on the Results tab.
