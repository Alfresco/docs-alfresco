# Editing a review date

If you've set up a review period for vital records in the record category or folder, you can edit the review date for individual records.

1.  Hover over a record in the File Plan and click **More** then **Edit Review Date**.

    The Edit Review Date dialog box displays. The current review date is highlighted.

2.  Select a new review date and click **Update**.

    A message displays confirming that the review date is updated. This overrules any review dates set at folder or category level.
