# Alfresco Governance Services

Alfresco Governance Services combines Alfresco Records Management with Security Controls and Classification.

Fully compliant with a baseline of DoD 5015.02. With Governance Services you can fully automate the record lifecycle from capture through retention to final destruction. Users can create records direct from any Alfresco Share site. On top of this security controls and classification give you complete control over who can see which records and when.
