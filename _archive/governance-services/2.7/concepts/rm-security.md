# Security Marks and Classification

You can add security controls to files, records, folders, and categories so that only users with the required security level can view or access them.

**Note:** When you install **Enterprise** the Security Controls features are installed at the same time.

Security controls is the collective term for security classifications and security groups, which in turn are made up of one or more security marks.

There is one predefined **Classification** security group, but you can add as many additional security groups as you need.

Files, records, folders, and categories can be classified using the **Classify** option to apply a security classification and security marks.

You can set up classification guides so that users can auto-classify content.

When an item is classified it can only be seen by those with the required security clearance, and the security classification level is shown on screen. Users without the necessary security clearance won't have access to it or even know that it's there. When a classified file is declared as a record it retains its classification level and security marks.

User security clearance is set for a user \(or user group\) by assigning security marks to them.

You can create **Classification Reasons** to help identify and align the reasons why content is classified. Governance Services comes pre-configured with some common classification reasons but you can edit, delete, and make your own.

**Tip:** Security controls are configured and assigned through the standard Alfresco Admin Tools, and can be used completely independently of a records management site if required.

Watch these videos for tips on using security controls and classification.
-   **[Classification life cycle](../concepts/rm-classification-lifecycle.md)**  
If you have the required security clearance and file permissions can classify and reclassify files, records, folders, and categories.
-   **[How security controls work](../concepts/rm-sc-overview.md)**  
Both the predefined Classification security group and any custom security groups function in largely the same way, with a few important differences.
-   **[How security clearance works](../concepts/rm-clearance-overview.md)**  
Security clearance is the assignment of security marks to users.
-   **[How classification guides work](../concepts/rm-cg-overview.md)**  
You'll usually have a number of common classification requirements for different types of content. For example, all staff records may require the same security levels to access them.
-   **[Creating a security group](../tasks/rm-create-security-group.md)**  
Each security group is made up of one or more security marks.
-   **[Adding security marks to a security group](../tasks/rm-add-marks.md)**  
You can add multiple security marks to a security group.
-   **[Setting security clearance](../tasks/rm-assign-sc.md)**  
Alfresco Administrators can assign different clearance levels to users and groups that give access to files and records within their clearance level.
-   **[Creating classification guides](../tasks/rm-create-guide.md)**  
Classification guides can be used to quickly classify content with a preset collection of security controls.
-   **[Classifying records, record folders, and record categories](../tasks/rm-classify-record.md)**  
You can classify records, record folders, and record categories and apply security marks so that they can only be viewed or accessed by users who have the required security clearance.
-   **[Declassification](../concepts/rm-declassification.md)**  
An item can be declassified when it is no longer considered to be classified. Declassification occurs after a period of time has elapsed or an event occurs.
-   **[Reclassifying content](../tasks/rm-reclassify.md)**  
You can edit classification details and change the assigned security marks, as well as reclassifying content to downgrade, upgrade, and declassify it.
