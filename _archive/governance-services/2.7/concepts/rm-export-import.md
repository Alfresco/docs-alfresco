# Exporting and importing File Plan content

You can quickly and easily import and export Records Management content, from individual record folders through to an entire File Plan.

This can be useful if you want to quickly build your File Plan, or parts of it, based on a File Plan that already exists on an Alfresco system.

You can move entire blocks of content – record categories, record folders, records, metadata, and retention schedules – within a File Plan or to another File Plan.

Files are imported and exported using the Alfresco Content Package \(ACP\) format. You can also choose to import and export the content as a zip file. Exported files contain all structural information including record categories, folders, and retention schedules, so they make for seamless building of a File Plan in another Alfresco system.

Exporting a File Plan bundles the contents and structure of the entire plan into an Alfresco Content Package \(ACP\). You can also choose to export the plan as a zip file.

Importing an Alfresco Content Package \(ACP\) or zip file into a Records Management system expands the package to its original structure. Existing content will not be overwritten.
