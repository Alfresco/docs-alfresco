# Administering Explorer from the Administration Console

The Administration Console enables Alfresco administrators to create and manage users and groups, manage categories, import and export spaces and content, and perform other administrative tasks from within Alfresco Explorer.

-   **[Managing users](../concepts/cuh-manage-users.md)**  
In Alfresco a home space is a place for users to store their items.
-   **[Managing user groups](../concepts/cuh-usergroups-manage.md)**  
User groups enable you to organize your Alfresco users.
-   **[Managing categories](../concepts/cuh-manage-categories.md)**  
Categories allow users to quickly and easily organize their content by classifying content items.
-   **[Importing the ACP file into a space](../tasks/tuh-admin-import.md)**  
The Import function in the Administration Console enables you to import an exported space to any space within Alfresco or into another Alfresco repository altogether.
-   **[Exporting a space and its contents](../tasks/tuh-admin-export.md)**  
The Export function in the Administration Console enables you to copy an Alfresco space and its contents.
-   **[Viewing System Information](../tasks/tuh-admin-systeminformation.md)**  
The System Information feature in the Administration Console displays settings and configuration values used by the environment on which Alfresco runs. The information available is read-only and is useful to Support for checking and diagnosing issues.
-   **[Using the Node Browser](../tasks/tuh-admin-nodebrowser.md)**  
The Node Browser is a debugging aid that allows you to browse the raw Alfresco repository structure. This feature is intended for developers responsible for customizing the application.
