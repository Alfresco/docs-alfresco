# Working with folders

Once the document library structure has been set up, site members can access and work with the folders that organize the library content. In the content item list, clicking a folder name or thumbnail displays the contents of that folder. From this list, site members can also choose to view the folder details and edit the properties defined for a folder.

-   **[Viewing folder details](../tasks/library-folder-viewdetails.md)**  
The details page for a folder gives you access to the actions you can perform on the folder; the comments feature; custom properties; and other details, including the folder URL, tags, and permission settings.
-   **[Viewing a folder in Alfresco Explorer](../tasks/library-folder-view-explorer.md)**  
The **View in Alfresco Explorer**action lets you display the selected folder in the Alfresco Explorer web client. This gives you access to all relevant Explorer actions.
-   **[Automating repetitive tasks](../concepts/library-folder-rules.md)**  
In the library you can define folder rules to manage your content automatically. You can come up with many creative solutions to make sure specific content is moved or transformed \(or both!\) all without you having to do the work yourself.
