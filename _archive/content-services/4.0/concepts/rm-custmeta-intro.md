# Creating custom metadata

The Records Management installation defines a default set of metadata. The metadata is logged against each level in the File Plan and at the record level itself.

-   **[Accessing the Custom Metadata tool](../tasks/rm-custmata-access.md)**  

-   **[Creating custom metadata](../tasks/rm-custmeta-create.md)**  
You can create custom metadata for record categories, record folders, records, and non-electronic documents. Once you create custom metadata, you cannot delete it.
-   **[Editing custom metadata](../tasks/rm-custmeta-edit.md)**
