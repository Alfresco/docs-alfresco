# Collaborate with colleagues on a document

A Document Workspace enables you to collaborate on documents with one or more colleagues. In the first scenario you created a Document Workspace, or Share site, called SPP. That workspace should now contain two documents: local.docx and another document that you uploaded, which is located in the Research folder.

With this site now set up and populated, the second scenario will familiarize you with some of the collaboration features available for working on workspace content with colleagues.

-   **[Save a document to the Document Workspace](../tasks/gs-spp-doc-save.md)**  
Now that you have created the Document Workspace, you can save Word documents directly to it.
-   **[Customize the Document Workspace](../concepts/gs-spp-workspace-customize.md)**  
Once the Document Workspace exists, you can manage the site directly from Word.
-   **[Manage the Document Workspace membership](../concepts/gs-spp-members-manage.md)**  
Only users who are members of the Document Workspace can work with the documents stored there. You perform the tasks relating to site members on the Members tab of the Document Management task pane.
-   **[Work with a Document Workspace document locally](../concepts/gs-spp-work-locally.md)**  
When you add or save a document to the Document Workspace, the original version of the document remains on your computer. This local copy of the document is linked to the copy in the siteâ€™s document library.
-   **[Delete the Document Workspace](../tasks/gs-spp-workspace-delete.md)**  
Once you complete the collaboration on the document you typically delete the Document Workspace as it is no longer required. This action permanently deletes the site and all of its contents.
