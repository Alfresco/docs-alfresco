# Managing content item users

Once users have been invited to a content item with defined roles, also referred to as permissions, you can manage the content users.

When a user or group is invited to a content item and given a role, they have permissions to that item in the specified capacity. The owner of the content item can remove users and groups from the item. The owner can also change the roles assigned to the invited users and groups.

If permissions are not specifically set for a content item, the permissions set for the space in which the content resides will be in effect.
