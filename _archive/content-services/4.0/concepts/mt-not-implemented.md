# Features not currently supported in a multi-tenant environment

This topic describes the features and components that are not supported in a multi-tenant production environment.

Using multi-tenancy, you can configure multiple, independent tenants on a single Alfresco instance. However, multi-tenancy is not supported in the following functionalities:

-   Record Management module
-   CIFS
-   WCM
-   Portlets
-   LDAP, NTLM and authentication methods other than `alfresco`
-   Inbound email
-   Content replication
-   IMAP
-   Alfresco Share \(for versions prior to Alfresco 3.2\)
