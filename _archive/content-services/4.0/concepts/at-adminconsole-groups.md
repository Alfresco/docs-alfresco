# Managing groups

The Groups tool in the Admin Console lets you create and manage user groups.

-   **[Browsing the user groups](../tasks/at-adminconsole-group-browse.md)**  
The Groups page contains a multi-paned panel that lets you navigate the hierarchy of user groups.
-   **[Searching for a group](../tasks/at-adminconsole-group-search.md)**  
The Search feature enables you to locate any user group, regardless of where it exists in the group hierarchy. Once located, you can edit or delete the group.
-   **[Creating a new group](../tasks/at-adminconsole-group-new.md)**  
The Admin Console enables you to create both top level user groups and subgroups within existing groups.
-   **[Editing an existing group](../tasks/at-adminconsole-group-edit.md)**  
Edit a user group to change the group’s display name. Once created, you cannot edit the group’s Identifier.
-   **[Deleting an existing group](../tasks/at-adminconsole-group-delete.md)**  
Delete a user group to remove it from the system.
-   **[Managing group membership](../tasks/at-adminconsole-group-membership.md)**  
To populate a user group, you can add both individual users and existing user groups.
