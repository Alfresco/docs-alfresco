# Prepare your site for collaboration

To make the new site as collaborative as possible, you should prepare it before inviting users.

In this step, you will:

-   Create an introduction and explanation for the site \(Wiki\)
-   Add a set of marketing material documents \(Document Library\)
-   Schedule a webinar introducing everyone to the site \(Calendar\)

-   **[Create an introduction](../tasks/gs-intro-create.md)**  
You use the Wiki page component within your site to write your introduction. Once it is written, you add it to the Wiki dashlet on your site dashboard.
-   **[Add marketing material](../tasks/gs-content-add.md)**  
You have been preparing for this site for a month now and have three pieces of marketing content that you would like to upload. For this step of the scenario, choose three pieces of content on your personal computer to add to the library.
-   **[Schedule a webinar](../tasks/gs-webinar-schedule.md)**  
As part of promoting this collaboration site, you want to schedule a webinar to welcome the new users and discuss the purpose of the site.
