# Managing events

In the Records Management system, events can control the life cycle of a record. There are several events that are defined internally to the system.

A system event is generated whenever an action occurs on a record or folder, such as versioned, cutoff, closed, superseded, and so on. These events can then be used in disposition instructions.

The following events are available in Records Management:

-   Abolished
-   All Allowances Granted Are Terminated
-   Case Closed
-   Case Complete
-   No longer needed
-   Obsolete
-   Redesignated
-   Related Record Transferred to Inactive Storage
-   Separation
-   Study Complete
-   Superseded
-   Training Complete
-   WGI action complete
