# Disposition schedules

Disposition schedules are a key function of the records management system. The disposition schedule defines the procedures required for maintaining records in the records management system until their eventual destruction or transfer to another location.

A disposition schedule contains one or more steps that define a particular action to be carried out at a date or after an event has occurred. An example disposition schedule is:

*Cutoff 30 days after filing, transfer to offline storage two years after cutoff, and destroy seven years after transfer.*

The disposition actions are:

-   Accession
-   Retain
-   Cutoff
-   Transfer
-   Destroy

-   **[Defining the disposition schedule](../tasks/rm-dispschedule-create.md)**  
The disposition schedule must be defined on a record category. The creation of a disposition schedule is a two part process: first create a summary of the schedule, then create the steps in the schedule. You follow the same steps to both create and edit the disposition schedule.

This section describes the restrictions on how you can use disposition schedules.
