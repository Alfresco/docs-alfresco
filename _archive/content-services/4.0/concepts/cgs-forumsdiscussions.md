# Forums and discussions

This application provides an easy way for people to collaborate using forums and discussions. Forums contain topics of discussion and topics contain posts from different users.

-   **[Creating a forum](../tasks/tgs-create-forum.md)**  
A forum space allows people to collaborate using forums and discussions. A forum space can contain any number of forums, or even other forum spaces if wanted.
-   **[Discussions](../tasks/tgs-discussions.md)**  
Discussions are like a forum attached to a piece of content. Wherever the document is moved, the discussion goes with it. They provide an ideal way to record decisions or annotations about a document without changing the content.
