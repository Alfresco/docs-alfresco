# Use SharePoint Protocol \(SPP\) Support with your MS Office documents

If you are familiar with editing your Microsoftâ„¢ Office documents using SharePoint, Alfresco enables you to work with the same interface, using Alfresco Share as your repository instead of SharePoint.

Refer to the Alfresco tutorial *Managing Alfresco Content from within Microsoft Office* for more details on how to use this functionality.
