# Enabling SlideShare with WebSphere

This section descibes how to enable Slideshare for an instance of Alfresco running on WebSphere. Using SlideShare, you can upload and share PowerPoint presentations, Word documents, and Adobe PDF Portfolios.

The steps required to complete this task vary depending upon the embedded search engine: Solr or Lucene.

**Note:** If you initially enable Solr on Alfresco and then switch to Lucene, you will already have **AlfrescoTrustStore** in the certificates. To enable SlideShare in this scenario, use the instructions for SlideShare with Alfresco \(Solr enabled\).
