# Adding simple workflow rules

This topic explains the simple workflow rules you will add to the space.

The workflow rules move the content item through the spaces, based on specific criteria. You will create the following rules:

-   Request Approval: move from Draft space to Request Approval space

-   Publish: move from Request Approval space to Publish space


-   **[Requesting draft approval](../tasks/tgs-request-approval.md)**  
In this task you will create a simple workflow rule to apply to content in the Drafts space.
-   **[Publishing the approved content](../tasks/tgs-publish-content.md)**  
Continue with the workflow rule that will apply to content in this space.
