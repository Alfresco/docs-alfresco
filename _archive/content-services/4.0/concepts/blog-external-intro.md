# Managing externally published blog posts

Once a blog post in your project site has been published to an external blog, additional features become available that enable you to manage that external post from within your project site.

To easily view the post, a link is added to the post summary. Click this to open the external blog post in a new window.

After updating an internal post the **Update Externally** action enables you to synchronize the external post with the edited version in your project site.

When the external post is longer required the **Remove Externally** action enables you to delete it from the external blog.

-   **[Updating an external blog post](../tasks/blog-post-external-update.md)**  
You update an external blog post to synchronize it with the version in the site blog.
-   **[Removing an external blog post](../tasks/blog-post-external-remove.md)**  
You can remove an externally published post at any time while still leaving it available in the internal site blog.
