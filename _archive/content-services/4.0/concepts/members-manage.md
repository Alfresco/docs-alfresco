# Managing members

In the Members component the member management tasks are divided across three pages.

The links to these pages appear beneath the site banner. They are:

-   **People**

    This is the default selection and displays the Search for Site Members page. On this page you can search for a particular site member and view a list of all site members. A site manager has access to additional functionality to remove a site member, change a member's role, and invite users to join the site.

-   **Groups**

    The **Groups** link displays the Search for Site Groups page. On this page you can search for a site group and view a list of all groups. A site manager has access to additional functionality to remove a site group, change a group's role, and add groups to the site.

-   **Pending Invites**

    The **Pending Invites** link displays the Manage Pending Invites page. On this page you can view the users that have been invited to join the current site and you can cancel a pending invitation. This page is available only to site managers.


The link of the currently displayed page appears highlighted so you can easily see which page you are viewing.

-   **[Accessing the Members component](../tasks/members-page-access.md)**  
Access the Members component to view the users and groups that are members of the current site. In this component you can also manage the site membership for any site in which you are a site manager.
-   **[Viewing site members](../tasks/members-view.md)**  
Use the Search for Site Members page to search for a particular site member. You can also choose to display a list of all site members.
-   **[Viewing site groups](../tasks/members-view-groups.md)**

At any time a site manager can change the role assigned to an individual site member or site group.
-   **[Removing a site member or site group](../tasks/members-remove.md)**  
At any time a site manager can remove an individual member or a group from a site.

The Manage Pending Invites page lets the site manager view the site invitations that users haven't responded to yet. An invitation can be revoked at any time until the recipient accepts it and becomes a site member.
