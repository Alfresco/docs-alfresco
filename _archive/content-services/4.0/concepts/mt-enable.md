# Enabling multi-tenancy

In Alfresco, the multi-tenancy feature is pre-configured out-of-the-box, although it is not enabled by default.

When you install Alfresco, multi-tenancy is disabled. The multi-tenancy feature is automatically enabled when the first tenant is created.

**Note:** Please note that only an Administrator user can create tenants.

However, if you wish to disable multi-tenancy, you need to delete all the tenants. See the [Managing tenants](../tasks/mt-config.md).
