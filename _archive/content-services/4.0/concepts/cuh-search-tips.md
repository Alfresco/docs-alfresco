# General search tips

Refer to these general tips to help you improve your search results in Alfresco.

-   **Single word**

    By default, Alfresco will search the filename and content of content items, and the filename of spaces, for the text entered in the search box. For example, if you are looking for all content items containing the word *William*, simply enter William in the search box.

-   **Multiple words**

    You can narrow your results further by using two or more search terms. For example, to find *William* and *Shakespeare*, type +William +Shakespeare in the search box.

-   **Quoted phrase**

    To find an exact phrase, surround your search term with quotation marks. For example, to find the phrase *to be or not to be*, type "to be or not to be" in the search box.

-   **Partial word match \(wildcard\)**

    If you want to match part of a word, you can insert an asterisk to represent the missing character\(s\). For example, a search for \*able will return results for *capable*, *readable*, and *scalable*. A search term can contain multiple wildcards.
