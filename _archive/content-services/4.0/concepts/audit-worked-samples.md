# Sample files

Audit sample files are distributed in the <TOMCAT\_HOME\>/classes/alfresco/extension/audit directory.

Samples can also be downloaded directly from the following location in svn:

http://svn.alfresco.com/repos/alfresco-open-mirror/alfresco/HEAD/root/projects/repository/config/alfresco/extension/audit/

When using a sample file, remove the .sample extension.
