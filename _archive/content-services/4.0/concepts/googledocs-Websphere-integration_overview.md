# Enabling Google Docs with WebSphere

This section describes how to enable Google Docs for an instance of Alfresco running on WebSphere.

The steps required to complete this task vary depending upon the embedded search engine: Solr or Lucene.

**Note:** If you initially enable Solr on Alfresco and then switch to Lucene, you will already have **AlfrescoTrustStore** in the certificates. To enable Google Docs in this scenario, use the instructions for Google Docs with Alfresco \(Solr enabled\).
