# Standalone Transformation Server prerequisites

The Alfresco Transformation Server requires the installation of the following software components:

-   Microsoft Windows 2008 Server R2 SP1 x64 with the latest hot fixes \(English\)
-   Microsoft Office 2010 SP1 x86 \(English\)
-   Java Development Kit 1.6 update 30 x86 \(or later updates of the JDK 1.6\)

The following points are important to note before you install the Transformation Server:

-   Install only the English versions of MS Windows Server 2008 and Office 2010 because other languages result in unpredictable behavior.

    **Note:** Although the server must be configured in English, this has no impact on the transformation language used for documents.

-   Make sure that the Windows print spooler service is running
-   Java 7 is not supported
-   Java 6 x64 is not supported
