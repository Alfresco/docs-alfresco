# Workspace dashlets in Share

In Share, the My Document Workspaces personal dashlet displays a list of all Document Workspace sites of which you are a member. Similarly, the My Meeting Workspaces personal dashlet displays a list of all Meeting Workspace sites of which you are a member. The My Sites personal dashlet displays all sites of which you are a member: Document Workspaces, Meeting Workspaces, and standard Share sites.

From these dashlets, you can do the following:

-   Click the name of the workspace to enter the related site.
-   Click the Delete icon to the right of the workspace name to delete the site.

Refer to the Share user help for details on customizing your personal dashboard to display one or both of these dashlets.
