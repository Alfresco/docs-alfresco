# Exporting and importing records

The Export and Import features let you move records between Records Management systems.

-   **[Exporting content](../tasks/rm-export.md)**  
Exporting a container bundles the contents and structure into an Alfresco Content Package \(ACP\). You can also choose to export the content as a ZIP file. This allows you to move entire blocks of content – record categories, record folders, records, metadata, and disposition schedules – within a File Plan or to another File Plan.
-   **[Importing content](../tasks/rm-import.md)**  
Importing an Alfresco Content Package \(ACP\) into a Records Management system expands the package to its original structure. Existing content will not be overwritten.
