# Managing relationships

The References feature in the File Plan lets you create associations between records. Each reference is defined by a Relationship. Several default relationship types are included in the Records Management Console. You create new and manage existing relationships with the Relationships tool.

-   **[Creating a new relationship](../tasks/rm-relationships-create.md)**  
The Records Management Console has several default relationships. Add to these as necessary to meet your needs. Once you create a relationship, you cannot delete it.
