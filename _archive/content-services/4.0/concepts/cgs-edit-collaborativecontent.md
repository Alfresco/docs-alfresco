# Editing content in a collaborative space

You can now explore how to edit content in a collaborative space while protecting the content.

With multiple authors collaborating on the content, you want to ensure that only one person modifies it at a time by checking it out. This creates a working copy and locks the original. When you check it in, the updated item overwrites the original item with the working copy and unlocks it.

-   **[Checking out a content item](../tasks/tgs-checkout.md)**  
In this task, you will check out content from a space so that others cannot modify the file with which you are working.
-   **[Checking in a content item](../tasks/tgs-checkin.md)**  
The **Lock** icon displayed beside the original content item lets you know that it cannot be modified. The only way you can modify it is to check in or undo the check out on the working copy. If you are not the person who checked out the document, hover the mouse over the lock icon on the original item to display the author who is currently editing the item.
-   **[Version history](../tasks/tgs-versionhistory.md)**  
You can view the version history for content in a space. As the content is versioned, previous iterations are available in the version history.
