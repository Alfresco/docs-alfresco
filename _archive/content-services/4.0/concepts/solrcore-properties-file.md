# Solr core configuration properties

The solrcore.properties configuration file is the property configuration file for a Solr core. There is one solrcore.properties file in each core's configuration directory. This section lists the properties of this file, their description, and the default value.

|Property Name|Description|Default Value|
|-------------|-----------|-------------|
|data.dir.root|This property specifies the top level directory path for the indexes managed by Solr.|C:/Alfresco/alf\_data/solr|
|data.dir.store|This property specifies the directory relative to data.dir.root where the data for this core is stored.|workspace/SpacesStore|

|alfresco.host|This property specifies the host name for the Alfresco instance that Solr should track and index. In a default installation, both Alfresco and Solr runs in the same Tomcat instance and on the same host, so host would be set to local host.|`localhost`|

|alfresco.hole.retention|Each track will revisit all transactions from the timestamp of the last in the index, less this value, to fill in any transactions that may have been missed.|`3600000`|
|alfresco.batch.count|This property indicates the number of updates that should be made to this core before a commit is executed.|`1000`|

|alfresco.encryption.ssl.keystore.location|This property specifies the CLIENT keystore location reference. If the keystore is file-based, the location can reference any path in the file system of the node where the keystore is located.|`ssl.repo.client.keystore`|
|alfresco.encryption.ssl.keystore.passwordFileLocation|This property specifies the location of the file containing the password that is used to access the CLIENT keystore, also the default that is used to store keys within the keystore.|`ssl-keystore-passwords.properties`|
|alfresco.encryption.ssl.truststore.type|This property specifies the CLIENT truststore type.|`JCEKS`|
|alfresco.encryption.ssl.truststore.provider|This property specifies the Java provider that implements the `type` attribute \(for example, JCEKS type\). The provider can be left unspecified and the first provider that implements the truststore type specified is used.|`&nbsp;`|

|alfresco.encryption.ssl.truststore.passwordFileLocation|This property specifies the location of the file containing the password that is used to access the CLIENT truststore, also the default that is used to store keys within the truststore.|`ssl-truststore-passwords.properties`|
|alfresco.enableMultiThreadedTracking|This property enables/disables multi-threaded tracking.|`true`|
|alfresco.corePoolSize|This property specifies the pool size for multi-threaded tracking. It is used for indexing nodes.|`3`|
|alfresco.maximumPoolSize|This property specifies the maximum pool size for multi-threaded tracking.|`-1`|
|alfresco.keepAliveTime|This property specifies the time \(in seconds\) to keep non-core idle threads in the pool.|`120`|

|alfresco.threadDaemon|This property sets whether the threads run as daemon threads or not. If set to `false`, shut down is blocked else it is left unblocked.|`true`|
|alfresco.workQueueSize|This property specifies the maximum number of queued work instances to keep before blocking against further adds.|`-1`|

|solr.queryResultCache.size|This property configures the Solr result cache.|`1024`|
|solr.queryResultCache.initialSize|This property configures the Solr result cache.|`1024`|
|solr.documentCache.size|This property configures the Solr document cache.|`512`|
|solr.documentCache.initialSize|This property configures the Solr document cache.|`512`|
|solr.queryResultMaxDocsCached|This property configures the Solr result cache.|`200`|

|alfresco.transactionDocsBatchSize|This property is used for batch fetching updates during tracking.|`100`|
|alfresco.changeSetAclsBatchSize|This property is used for batch fetching updates during tracking.|`100`|
|alfresco.aclBatchSize|This property is used for batch fetching updates during tracking.|`10`|
|solr.query.maximumResultsFromUnlimitedQuery|This property is used to set the maximum number of results returned by Solr queries, therefore, limiting otherwise unconstrained Solr queries to return a finite number of results. This prevents such unconstrained queries from consuming excessive resources. By default, the value is set to the same value as the `system.acl.maxPermissionChecks` property.**Note:**

-   This property is set in the alfresco-global.properties file, and not in the solrcore.properties file.
-   The Alfresco Share searches use the `<max-search-results>` property to control the number of search results. For more information, see [Controlling search results in Share](../tasks/controlling_search_results.md).

-   This property is used for queries without an explicit limit.

|`1000`|
|alfresco.index.transformContent|If this property is set to false, the index tracker will not transform any content and only the metadata will be indexed.|`false`|
