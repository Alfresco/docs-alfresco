# Web Projects service

Web content management applications use web projects to store content related to a web site, web application, and other types of managed web property. The key use case is where multiple artifacts must be managed together through the concept of change sets â€“ collections of related assets that must be managed as a whole.

There are various methods relating to the Web Projects service to support web applications, including the ability to:

-   Create web projects
-   Manage web projects

These services are accessible from both the JavaScript and RESTful layers.
