# The discussion forum

The discussion forum lets you post user-generated content related to a site. These topics often take the form of questions or comments with threaded discussions.

Members of a site can create new topics and can also reply to a posting to take part in a discussion on a specific topic.

**Note:** See [Customizing a site](../tasks/site-customize.md) for how to switch the discussion forum on and off for a site.
