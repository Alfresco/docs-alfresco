# The File Plan component

The File Plan is a container for the records management hierarchy. It is like a virtual filing cabinet for storing records. The navigation panel contains a navigation hierarchy showing this structure.

You can create a structure from scratch or load the Records Management test data from the Records Management dashlet to use as a starting point. This gives you an empty sample hierarchy that you can rework to meet your needs.
