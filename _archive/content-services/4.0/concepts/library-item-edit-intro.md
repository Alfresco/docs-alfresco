# Editing library content

There are multiple ways to edit document library content. Not every method is available for each content item.

The **Edit Offline** action is available for every content item. Use this to download a working copy of the item to your computer. This locks the item in the library to prevent others from editing the item simultaneously.

The **Inline Edit** action is available only for content items created with the **Create Content** feature in the library. Use this to edit these plain text, HTML, or XML documents directly in the document library.

The **Edit Online** action is available only for Microsoft Office 2003 or greater files. Use this to edit the content item without first saving it offline.

The **Check Out to Google Docs** action is available only for items with the aspect *Google Docs Editable*. Use this to work with items in Google Docs. Like the Edit Offline action, this locks the item in the library while it is being edited.

-   **[Editing an item offline](../tasks/library-item-edit-offline.md)**  
Use the offline editing feature to download an item to your computer. This locks the version in the library so that other users can't overwrite it while you make changes offline.
-   **[Editing an item inline](../tasks/library-item-edit-inline.md)**  
The **Inline Edit** action lets you edit plain text, HTML, and XML content items that were created using the **Create Content** feature in a siteâ€™s document library.
-   **[Editing your Microsoft Office documents online](../tasks/library-item-edit-online.md)**  
The **Edit Online** feature lets you edit your document without first saving it offline \(checking it out\). An invisible check-out action ensures your document remains protected, or locked, in the library during the editing session. When you finish editing the document is invisibly checked in with the updated version available to other users.
-   **[Editing content in Google Docs](../concepts/library-item-google-intro.md)**  
Library items that have the aspect *Google Docs Editable* can be edited offline in Google Docs.
