# Managing Alfresco Content from within Microsoft Office

This tutorial introduces using Microsoft Office to manage your Alfresco content.

Microsoft SharePoint Protocol technology enables Content Management \(CM\) to be used within Microsoft Office applications. The Content Management functionality mirrors that of SharePoint.

There are several ways to work with the SharePoint features of Microsoft Office. This tutorial highlights these features, including what Alfresco Share does and does not support. Differences between the Alfresco support and the standard SharePoint integration are identified for users already familiar with SharePoint.

The audience for this tutorial is users of Microsoft Office 2003 and 2007 on Windows. The procedures are documented using Microsoft Office 2007 only.

-   **[System requirements and prerequisites](../tasks/gs-spp-sysreq.md)**  
The support introduced is based on Office 2007 and is restricted to the Word, Excel, and PowerPoint applications.
-   **[Scenarios](../concepts/gs-spp-scenario.md)**  
The *Managing Alfresco Content from within Microsoft Office* tutorial walks you through the document management features built into Microsoft Office to illustrate how they can be used with documents stored in a Share collaboration site.
-   **[Manage a document](../concepts/gs-spp-doc-manage.md)**  
Many users will work with documents in the Share repository without ever entering the Share user interface. It is the SharePoint Protocol support built into Alfresco that enables you to do this.
-   **[Collaborate with colleagues on a document](../concepts/gs-spp-collaborate.md)**  
A Document Workspace enables you to collaborate on documents with one or more colleagues. In the first scenario you created a Document Workspace, or Share site, called SPP. That workspace should now contain two documents: local.docx and another document that you uploaded, which is located in the Research folder.
-   **[Collaborate with colleagues around a meeting](../concepts/gs-spp-mtgworkspace-intro.md)**  
To easily manage content related to a specific meeting, create a Meeting Workspace in Share when you create a meeting request in Microsoft Outlook.
-   **[Workspace dashlets in Share](../concepts/gs-spp-workspace-dashlet.md)**  
In Share, the My Document Workspaces personal dashlet displays a list of all Document Workspace sites of which you are a member. Similarly, the My Meeting Workspaces personal dashlet displays a list of all Meeting Workspace sites of which you are a member. The My Sites personal dashlet displays all sites of which you are a member: Document Workspaces, Meeting Workspaces, and standard Share sites.
-   **[Features not supported in this release](../concepts/gs-spp-unsupported-features.md)**  
This version of Alfresco does not currently support all SharePoint features.
