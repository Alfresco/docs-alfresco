# Space header

The space header contains the Breadcrumb Path, details on the current space, and the functions available within the space.

The Breadcrumb Path is located at the top of the header. It is a navigation breadcrumb that allows easy access to any part of the current navigation path. These breadcrumbs allow you to return to a previously visited space without having to repeat all the steps. Each breadcrumb item is a link. Clicking a link returns you to its corresponding space.

**Note:** For information on the origin of breadcrumbs, refer to the Wikipedia article: [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadcrumb\_\(navigation\)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadcrumb_(navigation)).

The name of the current space and details about that space are displayed beneath the breadcrumb path.

An icon, ![Content Rules](../images/im-rules.png), to the right of the space name indicates the number of rules currently applied to this space. The available functions and menus display on the right side of the header. These can include links for creating content and spaces, as well as an option for changing the way Alfresco displays content in the space.
