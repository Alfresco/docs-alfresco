# Scenarios

The *Managing Alfresco Content from within Microsoft Office* tutorial walks you through the document management features built into Microsoft Office to illustrate how they can be used with documents stored in a Share collaboration site.

A *Collaboration Site* in Alfresco Share is the equivalent of a *Team Site* in SharePoint.

While all Microsoft Office applications \(Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and Outlook\) can interact with Share, for the purpose of this tutorial, you will perform the tasks in Microsoft Word 2007 and Microsoft Outlook 2007 for Windows.

**Note:** Microsoft Office 2010 onwards doesn't include a Document Management panel for working with the Alfresco repository from Microsoft Office, but you can still use the online editing feature in Alfresco. You can reopen documents stored in Alfresco by clicking **File** then **Recent** in a Microsoft Office program and selecting the document.

For this tutorial, you will be walking through the following scenarios.

Managing a document within Microsoft Word, which includes:

-   Creating a Document Workspace
-   Editing a document \(checking out and in\)
-   Viewing a previous document version and then restoring the document to that version
-   Adding content to a Document Workspace

Collaborating with colleagues for a document review, which includes:

-   Saving a document to the Document Workspace
-   Customizing the Document Workspace
-   Managing the site membership by adding users; viewing and editing user profiles; and changing member roles
-   Working with linked documents \(local and site copies\)
-   Deleting the Document Workspace

Collaborating with colleagues around a meeting, which includes:

-   Creating a Meeting Workspace
-   Viewing the workspace from Outlook
-   Adding and removing users from the Meeting Workspace
-   Cancelling a meeting
