# The wiki

The site wiki lets members create pages for a collaborative website. You can contribute and modify content using a simplified markup language.

When you enter the wiki the page view displays the wiki main page. Click **Wiki Page List** to display the wiki list.

The wiki page list displays a summary of all pages created for the current site's wiki. Select a page in this list to view it in the page view.

In both views \(wiki list and page view\) you can create, delete, view details for, and edit a wiki page. However, you must be in the page view to rename a wiki page.

**Note:** See [Customizing a site](../tasks/site-customize.md) for how to switch the wiki on and off for a site.

-   **[Accessing the wiki](../tasks/wiki-page-access.md)**  
Access the wiki to view the wiki content related to the current site. Within the wiki you can create, delete, rename, and edit the wiki pages. You can perform most actions from both the wiki list and the page view.
-   **[Browsing the wiki pages](../tasks/wiki-browse-pages.md)**  
The browsing feature in the wiki lets you filter the wiki pages so you can easily locate specific content.
-   **[Creating the wiki main page](../tasks/wiki-page-main-create.md)**  
When you create a new site, the site's wiki contains a main page, which is empty. You will likely choose to make this the introductory page for the site wiki.
-   **[Creating a new wiki page](../tasks/wiki-page-create.md)**  
You can create a new wiki page from both the wiki list and the page view.
-   **[Editing a wiki page](../tasks/wiki-page-edit.md)**  
Edit a wiki page to create new content, edit existing content, and add tags.
-   **[Renaming a wiki page](../tasks/wiki-page-rename.md)**  
You rename a wiki page in the page view.
-   **[Deleting a wiki page](../tasks/wiki-page-delete.md)**  
Delete a wiki page when you no longer want it to appear in the wiki for the current site. You can perform this task from both the wiki list and the page view.
-   **[Viewing the wiki page details](../tasks/wiki-page-view-details.md)**  
View wiki page details to see the version history, view the tags associated with the page, and list the wiki pages that link to the selected page. You can view the page details from both the wiki list and the page view. On this page, you can view previous versions of the page and even revert to a specific version.
