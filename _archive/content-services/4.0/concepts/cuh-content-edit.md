# Editing content

There are two options available for editing documents: **Edit Online** and **Edit Offline**.

The **Edit Online** action is available for HTML and plain text documents but only when the **Edit Inline** option is enabled for the content item. This option is enabled by default when you add an HTML or plain text document to the repository. You can change this setting at any time by editing the content item details.

-   **[Editing content online](../tasks/tuh-content-edit-online.md)**  
When online editing is enabled for an HTML or plain text content item, you can edit the item online. This shortcut enables you to bypass the tasks of downloading the item to your computer and then updating the repository version with the changes.
-   **[Editing content offline](../tasks/tuh-content-edit-offline.md)**  
The Edit Offline feature enables you to download an item from the repository to your computer to edit it with the appropriate desktop application. This process automatically locks the repository version of the content item to prevent editing conflicts.
