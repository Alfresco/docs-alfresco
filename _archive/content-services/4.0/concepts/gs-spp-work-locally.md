# Work with a Document Workspace document locally

When you add or save a document to the Document Workspace, the original version of the document remains on your computer. This local copy of the document is linked to the copy in the siteâ€™s document library.

It is important to understand the relationship between these files. Once linked, you can work on one version and then update the other to keep the two files synchronized.

You can do the following with linked documents:

-   Download updates from the Document Workspace copy into the local copy
-   Update the Document Workspace copy with changes made locally
-   Save an updatable copy on another computer
-   Manage the document updates by merging, comparing, or replacing copies

-   **[Download document updates from the site](../tasks/gs-spp-getupdates.md)**  
Use the file local.docx, which you used to create the SharePoint Protocol Support Document Workspace. It should still reside on your desktop; a copy also exists in the workspace \(Share site library\).
-   **[Update the Document Workspace copy](../tasks/gs-spp-sitecopy-update.md)**  
When a local copy of a document is linked to a Document Workspace, Word detects changes made to the document and prompts you to resolve the discrepancy. While in the previous task you updated the local copy with the version from the workspace, in this task you will update the workspace copy with the local version.
-   **[Save an updatable copy locally](../tasks/gs-spp-sitecopy-savelocally.md)**  
You \(User A\) have the original copy of the document local.docx on your desktop. The **Save Updatable Copy** feature in Word enables other site members to obtain a copy of this document to reside on their own machines.
-   **[Manage document updates](../tasks/gs-spp-updates-manage.md)**  
When multiple users hold local copies of a Document Workspace document, the Document Updates pane provides you with options for managing the edits. When changes to your local copy are found to conflict with the version stored in the site, this feature enables you to compare the two versions, overwrite either copy, or merge the two copies.
