# Creating a space from a template

You can use a template to create a space in Alfresco.

Space templates allow you to create a hierarchy of spaces with only a few steps. The spaces can have default rules.

The out-of-the box application contains the template Software Engineering Project. The spaces in this template are a typical set of spaces that you might create for a software project, so the same template could be used for all of your projects. If the template does not exactly match your needs, you can add and delete spaces to customize it as necessary.

The Software Engineering Project can be found at: **Company Home** \> **Data Dictionary** \> **Space Templates** \> **Software Engineering Project**

1.  Navigate to the space where you want to create the new space.

    The space header displays the name and details of the space in which the new space will be created.

2.  In the **Create** menu, click **Advanced Space Wizard**.

3.  In Step One, Starting Space, select the option **Using a template** and click **Next**.

4.  In Step Two, Space Options, select the template you want to apply to the space being created and click **Next**.

    This step should display a list of default space templates that were supplied with the application. For more information, contact your system administrator.

5.  In Step Three, Space Details, type the relevant information in the **Name**, **Title**, and **Description** boxes. Optionally, select an icon to represent the type of content that you intend to put in the space. Click **Next**.

6.  In Step Four, Summary, check that all information entered is correct and click **Finish**.
