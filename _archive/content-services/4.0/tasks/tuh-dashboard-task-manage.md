# Managing a task

The **My Tasks To Do** pane displays all tasks assigned to the currently logged in user. The **Type** column indicates the reason the task has been assigned.

The actions available to perform on the selected task vary depending on the type of task being managed. For example:

-   When content is assigned to a user as part of the editorial review process, a Review task is created. The actions available for a Review task are **Approve** and **Reject**.
-   When content submitted for review is approved, an Approved task is created and assigned to the user who initiated the review workflow. The action available on an Approved task is **Task Done**.
-   When content submitted for review is rejected, a Rejected task is created and assigned to the user who initiated the review workflow. The actions available on a Rejected task are **Abort Review** and **Resubmit for Review**.
-   When content is successfully submitted to the staging environment and is awaiting a specified launch date, a Submission Pending task is assigned to the user who initiated the submission. The actions available for a Submission Pending task are **Abort Submission** and **Submit Now**.

When you process a task in the **My Tasks To Do** list, the task is added to the My Completed Tasks list, regardless of the type of task being managed.

    The task is added to your **My Completed Tasks** list and is also reassigned to another user, if the workflow is not yet complete.
