# Creating a new relationship

The Records Management Console has several default relationships. Add to these as necessary to meet your needs. Once you create a relationship, you cannot delete it.

This task assumes that you are on the Link Relationships page of the Records Management Console.

1.  Click **New Relationship**.

    The New Relationship page displays.

2.  Select the relationship type:

    -   Bi-directional
    -   Parent/Child
3.  Complete the appropriate field\(s\) appropriate for the relationship type.

    The values you enter display in the File Plan when a user creates the reference.

4.  Click **Save**.

    The new relationship appears in the list, which is sorted alphabetically.
