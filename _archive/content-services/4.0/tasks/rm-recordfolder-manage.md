# Managing record folders

Record folders can be managed by users with the appropriate capability permissions.

1.  Navigate to the File Plan and select a record folder.

2.  In the items list, position the cursor over the record folder of interest to display the available actions.

    The following actions are available:

    |Action|Select this to...|
    |------|-----------------|
    |View Details|View the record folder details page, where you can see the metadata and full list of actions.|
    |Edit Metadata|Edit the record folder metadata.|
    |Close Folder|Close the folder. A closed record folder cannot accept records for filing. When you close the folder, this action toggles to the **Re-open Folder** action.|
    |Edit Disposition Date|Change disposition date. This is the date of the last disposition step.|
    |Freeze|Freeze the folder. A folder must be eligible for freezing, according to its disposition schedule. Folders that are eligible for freezing appear in the temporary space Holds. When you freeze the folder, this action toggles to the **Unfreeze** action.|
    |Copy to|Create a copy of the folder in another location in the File Plan.|
    |Move to|Move the folder to another location in the File Plan.|
    |Manage Permissions|Set the user and group access for the folder.|
    |Delete|Delete the folder from the File Plan.|
    |View Audit Log|View the auditing information for the folder. The Audit Log displays the activity information in a new window and provides the facility to export or file this information as a record.|

    When the folder is closed or frozen, a limited set of actions is available.


-   **[Viewing record folders](../tasks/rm-recordfolder-view.md)**  
The record folder details page gives you access to the actions available to be performed on the folder; the custom metadata; and the folder URL.
-   **[Editing a record folder](../tasks/rm-recordfolder-edit.md)**  

-   **[Deleting a record folder](../tasks/rm-recordfolder-delete.md)**  

-   **[Closing a record folder](../tasks/rm-recordfolder-close.md)**  
Users with the appropriate capability \(Folder Control\) permissions can close folders. Closed folders cannot accept any further records.
-   **[Freezing record folders](../tasks/rm-recordfolder-freeze.md)**  
Users with the appropriate capability \(Extend Retention Period Or Freeze\) permissions can freeze records and folders. This places a hold on the object. A hold allows objects frozen for a particular reason to be tracked as a set. Holds prevent changes to frozen objects, which have their retention schedules suspended until the hold is removed. When you freeze a folder, all records within that container are also frozen.
