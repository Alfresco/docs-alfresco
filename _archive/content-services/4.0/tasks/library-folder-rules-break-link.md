# Breaking the link to a rule set

If you don't need your rules anymore, breaking the link is just a single click away. This leaves the folder without any rules.

1.  Hover over a folder with rules applied \(indicated by the ![](../images/rules-icon.png) icon\) and click ![Add Event icon](../images/AddEvent_icon.png) **More** then ![](../images/rules-icon.png) **Manage Rules**.

2.  Click **Unlink**.

    The link between the current folder and the rule set is now broken.
