# Defining rules for a folder

Use folder rules to manage your library content automatically. There are two ways to define rules: create your own rules or link to rules already created for a different folder.

When you define a rule, it only applies to new content added to the folder. Items that were in the folder before the rule was defined aren't affected by it. You can manually apply the folder rules with the **Run Rules** action.

**Note:** Even though the folder doesn't have its own rules, it could have inherited rules from a parent folder. A message on the Rules page lets you know if this is the case.

-   **[Creating a new rule from scratch](../tasks/library-folder-rules-define-create.md)**  
Use the **Create Rules** option to set up rules for a folder, in much the same way that you might apply rules to your emails.
-   **[Linking to an existing rule set](../tasks/library-folder-rules-define-link.md)**  
The **Link to Rule Set** option lets you reuse an existing rule set that's already defined for another folder.
