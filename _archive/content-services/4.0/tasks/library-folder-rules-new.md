# Adding a new rule

A rule set can include any number of individual rules, and you can add new rules to a folder as you need.

1.  Hover over a folder with rules applied \(indicated by the ![](../images/rules-icon.png) icon\) and click ![Add Event icon](../images/AddEvent_icon.png) **More** then ![](../images/rules-icon.png) **Manage Rules**.

2.  Click **New Rule**.

    The New Rule page appears where you can add a new rule to the folder in exactly the same way as the first time you created a rule - see [Create a rule from scratch](library-folder-rules-define-create.md) for more details.


After creating the last rule you return to the Rules page. Any new rules created are added at the end of the rule set.
