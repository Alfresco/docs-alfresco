# Adding a record folder

You can create a record folder only within a record category.

1.  Navigate to the File Plan and select a category.

2.  Click **New Folder**.

    The New Record Folder dialog box displays.

3.  Enter details for the new folder. Fields marked with an asterisk \(\*\) are required.

    In the **Location** field you can specify the physical location of the records contained within this folder.

4.  Click **Save**.

    The new folder displays in the File Plan.


The new record folder is marked as Open, which means that records may be filed in it. The date of opening is recorded as the same time as the creation date.
