# Manually running a replication job

The **Run Job** feature enables you to manually run a replication job. You can do this at any time. If a schedule is set for the job, it remains in place and will be run at the appropriate time.

1.  On the toolbar, expand the **More** menu and click **Replication Jobs** in the Tools list.

2.  In the Jobs section, click the job you want to run.

    The job appears highlighted in the list and its details appear on the right side of the page.

    **Note:** For a job to be run, it must be enabled.

3.  Click **Run Job**.

    The Status section on the right side of the page indicates that the job is running. The date and time the job started is displayed.
