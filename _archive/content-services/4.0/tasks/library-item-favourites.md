# Specifying favorites

If there are folders and items in the library that you access often, mark them as favorites so that you can easily find them in the My Favorites view. Your favorite items will also be easy to locate on your personal dashboard: they display when you select the My Favorites filter on the My Documents dashlet.

This task assumes you are in the library of the desired site. To perform this task on a folder the **Show Folders** feature must be enabled.

You can mark any folder or item as a favorite. You can favorite an item in the item list \(detailed view onlyâ€”this feature does not appear in the simple view\) or on the details page. You can favorite a folder only in the detailed view of the item list.

All new folders and items display a star outline to the left of the action: ![](../images/at-favorite_no.png). A solid star indicates the content has been marked as a favorite: ![](../images/at-favorite_yes.png).

Though you can browse the library to find an item to mark as a favorite, it's more likely that you'll simply choose to favorite content as you come across or work with it. In this case the first two steps will not apply.

1.  Ensure the item list is displayed in the detailed view.

2.  Browse the library to locate the folder or item you want to mark as a favorite.

3.  Click the star outline or the **Favorite** action of the folder or item you want to mark as a favorite.

    **Note:** If you are marking a content item, consider previewing it first to ensure it is the correct one. You can favorite the item on the details page.

4.  Click the **My Favorites** view in the browsing pane to display a list of all folders and content items that you have designated as favorites.

    **Tip:** Simply click the solid star to revoke its status as a favorite.
