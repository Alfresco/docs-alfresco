# Viewing content rules

You can view rules in a space based on where they have been created.

The default view on the Content Rules page is **Local**, which displays all rules that have been created for this specific space.

The view option **Inherited**displays the rules that have been inherited from the space in which the current space is contained. For example, if your name space is in the User Homes space, you can view the rules your name space has inherited from the User Homes space.

1.  Navigate to the space whose content rules you want to view.

    The space header displays the name and details of the space.

2.  In the **More Actions** menu, click **Manage Content Rules**.

3.  To change the view, click the current view \(**Inherited** or **Local**\) and select the alternate view.
