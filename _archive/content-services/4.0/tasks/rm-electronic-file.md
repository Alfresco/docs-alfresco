# Filing an electronic record

Electronic records are files that are uploaded into the Alfresco Records Management repository.

This task assumes that you are in a record folder and you have chosen to upload an electronic record. The Upload File\(s\) dialog box displays.

1.  In the Choose Record Type section, you can select the record type.

    |**Record type**|**Description**|
    |---------------|---------------|
    |****Web Record****|A web page|
    |****Scanned Record****|A file that is scanned into the Records Management system|
    |****PDF Record****|A PDF file|
    |****Digital Photograph Record****|A photographic image file|

    **Note:** The record type associates specific metadata with the records being uploaded. When you upload multiple items at once, all items will be identified with the selected record type.

2.  In the Choose File\(s\) section, click the **Select file\(s\) to upload** button.

3.  Locate the file\(s\) on your computer that you want to upload and click **Open**.

    Select multiple items using the method appropriate for your operating system.

    The selected items appear in the list. Click **Remove** to delete an item from this list, if necessary.

4.  Click **Upload File\(s\)** when this list contains all the items you want to upload.

    An indicator informs you of the upload progress. When 100% displays for all files, you can proceed.

5.  Click **OK**.

    The new records display in the File Plan as undeclared records.
