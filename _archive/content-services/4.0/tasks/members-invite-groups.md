# Adding groups to a site

Inviting users one at a time to join your site can be time consuming. To save time you can add existing user groups to the current site.

This task assumes you are in the Members component of the desired site.

The process of adding a group involves searching for the group, assigning a role to the group as a whole, and then adding the group. Unlike adding users, no invitation is extended to the users in the selected group; the group is added immediately. The available user roles are Manager, Collaborator, Contributor, and Consumer.

1.  Click **Groups** beneath the banner if this page is not already selected.

2.  Click **Add Groups**.

3.  Search for and add groups.

    1.  In the **Find Groups to add to this site** box, type the full or partial name of the group you want to add.

        You must enter a minimum of one \(1\) character. The search is not case sensitive.

    2.  Click **Search**.

        The list displays all groups matching the specified search criteria.

    3.  Click **Add** to the right of the group you want to add.

        The group appears in the **Add these Groups** box.

4.  In the **Add these Groups** box specify a role for the users of each group.

    -   To set the role for a group, click **Select Role** to the right of the group and click the desired role.
    -   To set the same role for all groups in the list, click **Set All Roles to** at the top of the list and click the desired role.
    **Note:** Click **back to Site Groups** to return to the Search for Site Groups page without adding any groups.

5.  Click **Add Groups** to add all groups displayed in the list.
