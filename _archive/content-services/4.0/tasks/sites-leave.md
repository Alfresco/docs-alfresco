# Leaving a site

It's quick and easy to leave a site when you no longer want to be a member.

Leaving a site varies slightly depending on your role in the site.

1.  On the dashboard of the site you want to leave, click either **Actions** or **More**.

2.  Click **Leave Site**.

3.  Click **OK** to confirm that you want to leave the site.

    **Restriction:** All sites require a site manager so if you're the only manager of a site you can't leave it.

    **Tip:** You can also leave a site by clicking **Leave** in the Site Finder.
