# Open Alfresco Share in a browser window

You can use the Share.url to open the Alfresco Share interface in a browser window.

The Share.url is a shortcut to Alfresco Share. It is available in a Windows environment if the Alfresco repository has been mapped by your administrator so that you can access it from Windows Explorer.

1.  In Windows Explorer go to the location in the Alfresco repository that you want to open.

2.  Double-click the Share.url.

    **Note:** There is a copy of the Share.url at each level of the repository.

    The Alfresco Share interface will open in a browser window, showing the location where you clicked on Share.url.
