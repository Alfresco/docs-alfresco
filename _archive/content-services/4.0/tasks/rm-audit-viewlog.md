# Viewing the full log

You can view the full contents of the log file in a separate window. From there you can save an HTML version of the report on your computer or in the Records Management File Plan.

This task assumes that you are on the Audit page of the Records Management Console.

1.  Click **View Full Log**.

    A separate window opens displaying the audit log.

2.  Optionally, save the log report in one or both of the following ways:

    -   Click **Export** to save the report to your computer.
    -   Click **File as Record** to file the report as an undeclared record in the File Plan.
3.  Close the window.
