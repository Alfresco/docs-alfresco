# Browsing the library content

The browsing feature in the library lets you filter the content items so you can more easily locate the items you want to work with.

This task assumes you are in the library of the desired site.

You can select a specific view, a folder, or a tag in the browsing pane on the left side of the page to display a subset of the library items.

The **Documents** list in the browsing pane provides the following views:

-   **All Documents**

    Displays all items in the library

-   **I'm Editing**

    Displays the items checked out by the current user

-   **Others are Editing**

    Displays the items checked out by other site members

-   **Recently Modified**

    Displays items modified in the past seven days

-   **Recently Added**

    Displays items added to the library in the past seven days

-   **My Favorites**

    Displays the items the current user has marked as favorites


The **Library** section displays the folder structure in a tree view. The symbol ![](../images/Subfolders.png) indicates a library folder contains subfolders.

The **Tags** list displays the tags currently associated with one or more items. The number following the tag tells you how many library items have that tag.

1.  Select an option in the browsing pane:

    1.  In the **Documents** list click a content set to display all items in the current site that correspond to that selection.

    2.  In the **Library** section navigate the tree and click a folder to display its contents.

        The Breadcrumb Path above the content item list displays your current position within the folder structure. Each breadcrumb item is a link so you can easily return to any part of the current navigation path. You can:

        -   Click a link to return to the corresponding folder.
        -   Click the **Up** icon to display the contents of the folder one level higher.
        -   Click the **Hide Breadcrumb** icon to remove the breadcrumb path.
        -   Click the **Show Breadcrumb** icon to display it again.
    3.  In the **Tags** list click the tag you're interested in to display all items in this library that are associated with that tag.

2.  Click the **Simple View** icon to display only basic item details: name, name of creator or modifier, and approximate time since the item was created or edited.

    Click the **Detailed View** icon to display the summary view.

3.  Position the cursor over an item in this list to display its available actions.
