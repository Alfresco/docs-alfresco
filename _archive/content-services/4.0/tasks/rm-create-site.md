# Creating the Records Management site

These steps assume that you have added the Records Management dashlet into your Share dashboard.

1.  On the Records Management dashlet, click **Create Records Management Site**.

    A message displays to confirm that the site had been created.

2.  Refresh the Share dashboard, either:

    -   Refresh the browser, or
    -   Logout of Share, and then logon again using the same user name and password.

The Records Management site now displays in the My Sites dashlet. You can also see the following additional actions in the Records Management dashlet:

-   **Records Management Site** to give you another way to access the Records Management site you have created
-   **Load Test Data** for an example of how to structure a File Plan
-   **Management Console** to access the administration features
