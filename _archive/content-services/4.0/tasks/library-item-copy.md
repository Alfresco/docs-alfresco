# Copying content

You can copy library content from its current location to another site or to any space in the Alfresco Explorer repository. The selected content, which can be an individual item or an entire folder, remains in its original location and a copy is placed at the location specified.

This task assumes you are in the library of the desired site. To copy a folder and its contents the **Show Folders** feature must be enabled.

This feature is also available for multiple selections being copied to a common destination.

1.  Navigate the libraryâ€™s folder structure to locate the content you want to copy.

2.  Position the cursor over the folder or item of interest in the item list to display the available actions.

    **Note:** When copying a content item this action copies only the current version. The version history for the item is not included in the copy. Existing comments are not carried over to the new document.

3.  Click **More** and then **Copy to**.

    The Copy \[name\] to dialog box appears.

4.  Select the Destination:

    -   Click **Sites** to copy the selected content to another site.
    -   Click **Repository** to copy the selected content to a space in Alfresco Explorer.
    -   Click **My User Home** to copy the selected content to your User Home space in Explorer.
5.  Specify the path, as follows, depending on whether you are copying to a site or to the Explorer repository:

    -   When copying to a site, click the desired site in the **Site** list. For the **Path**, navigate the folder structure and click the destination folder.
    -   When copying to a repository or your User Home space, navigate the repository structure and click the destination space.
6.  Click **Copy**.


A copy of the content is created. This is considered a new item so appears as version 1.0, with you as the creator.
