# Customize the site dashboard

You can add and reorder the site dashlets on the site dashboard the same as you do with personal dashlets on your personal dashboard.

1.  Ensure you are in your new site and click **Customize Dashboard** on the banner.

    The Customize Site Dashboard page where you add and remove site dashlets appears.

2.  Click **Add Dashlets** and add **Site Wiki** to your site dashboard.

3.  Click **OK**.


The configuration is saved and you return to the updated site dashboard.
