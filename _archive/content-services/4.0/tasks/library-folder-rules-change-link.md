# Linking to a different rule set

If you want to change the rules you're linked to, you can easily link to a different rule set.

1.  Hover over a folder with rules applied \(indicated by the ![](../images/rules-icon.png) icon\) and click ![Add Event icon](../images/AddEvent_icon.png) **More** then ![](../images/rules-icon.png) **Manage Rules**.

2.  Click **Change**.

    **Note:** This option only shows if the folder has linked rules.

3.  Find the folder you want to use.

4.  Select the site then select a folder.

    You can only select locations you have permission to access.

5.  Click **Link**.

    This breaks the link to the original rule set and links you to the new one.

6.  Click **Done**.
