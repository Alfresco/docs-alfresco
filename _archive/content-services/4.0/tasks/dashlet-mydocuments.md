# My Documents dashlet

The My Documents dashlet lets you easily track your own content, no matter which site it is in.

On this dashlet you can:

-   Use the filter to view the library content you have recently modified, that you currently have checked out for editing, or that you have marked as a favorite.

-   Select a view option: **Simple** or **Detailed**.

-   Mark an item as a favorite or remove it from the Favorites list. \(detailed view only\)

-   Like an item or “unlike” it. \(detailed view only\)

-   Click the **Comment** link to jump to the library where you can add a comment on this item. \(detailed view only\)
