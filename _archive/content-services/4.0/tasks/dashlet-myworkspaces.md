# My Meeting Workspaces and My Document Workspaces dashlets

Meeting and document workspaces are types of sites that are created outside of Alfresco.

A meeting workspace is a site where you can manage meeting materials such as an agenda or presentations. If you are [Managing Alfresco Content from within Microsoft Office](../concepts/gs-spp-intro.md) you can create a meeting space from within Outlook. A document workspace is an Alfresco site created from within Word.

The My Meeting Workspaces and My Document Workspaces dashlets display all of your meeting and document workspaces.

On these dashlets you can:

-   Navigate to a workspace.

-   Delete a workspace if you have the correct permissions.
