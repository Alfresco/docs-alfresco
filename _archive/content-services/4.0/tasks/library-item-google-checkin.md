# Checking in an item from Google Docs

Once you finish editing content in Google Docs you must check it back into the library to upload the changes. This releases the lock on the library item making it available to other users for editing.

This task assumes you are in the library of the desired site and that the item you want to work with has been checked out by you to Google Docs.

1.  Navigate the library’s folder structure to locate the item you want to check in.

    Click **I’m Editing** in the Documents section of the browsing pane to view the content items you currently have checked out.

2.  Position the cursor over the item in the item list that you want to check in to display the available actions.

3.  Click **Check In from Google Docs**.


The item is updated with the content from Google Docs. The lock is removed and the item no longer appears in the **I’m Editing** view.
