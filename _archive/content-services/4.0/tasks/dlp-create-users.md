# Creating Liferay users

This task describes how to create the Liferay users.

Ensure that the Alfresco server is started first, and then start up Liferay. Check that no errors are recorded in the application logs.

1.  Log in to Liferay as an administrator user.

2.  Create a new user account for each of the Alfresco users that you wish to give access to the portal.

    The users must have already been set up in Alfresco with the correct permissions. The screen name of the user in Liferay must match their Alfresco user name.
