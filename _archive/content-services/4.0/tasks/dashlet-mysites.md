# My Sites dashlet

The My Sites dashlet lists the sites you currently belong to.

On this dashlet you can:

-   Click **Create Site** to create a new site.

-   Click a site name to navigate to that site; the site dashboard displays.

-   Use the filter to display all of your sites or just those in the **My Favorites** list.

-   Click the star outline or **Favorite** to add the related site to the My Favorites list. Clicking a solid star removes a favorite site from this list.

-   Click the Delete icon to the right of the site name to delete the site and all of its contents. Position your cursor over the site name to reveal this action. This is available only if you are a manager of that site.

    **Note:** If you want to navigate to a site that's not in this dashlet you can search for it on the Site Finder page.
