# Reassigning a task

You can reassign any task in your task list to another user. This simply moves the selected task from your task list to the task list of the selected user.

1.  In the **My Tasks To Do** list, click ![Reassign Task](../images/im-dshbd_reassign.png) **\(Reassign\)** for the task you want to reassign.

    The Reassign Task page opens.

2.  In the search box, type the full or partial name of the user you want to add and click **Search**.

    You must enter a minimum of two \(2\) characters.

3.  In the results list, click to select the user you want to assign the selected task to.

4.  Click **OK**.
