# Accessing a library item in Google Docs

When a library item is checked out to Google Docs you can access it for viewing and editing. You can do this from within the library.

This task assumes you are in the library of the desired site and that the item you want to work with has been checked out by you to Google Docs.

When an item is checked out any user with the appropriate read/write privileges can view and edit it in Google Docs. However, only the user who owns the lock on the item is able to check it back into the library to upload the changes.

1.  Navigate the libraryâ€™s folder structure to locate the item you want to work with.

2.  Position the cursor over the item of interest in the item list to display the available actions.

3.  Click **View in Google Docs**.

    **Note:** You can also click the Google Docs link in the note that appears above the item indicating that it has been uploaded to Google Docs for editing.

    This action is also available on the details page.


Google Docs opens displaying the selected item. From here you can edit the content as desired.

**Note:** Although you may be the user who created this item in the site library, you will not be listed as the owner in Google Docs. The Google account provided in the Admin Console is always listed as the owner; the site members with appropriate read/write privileges have editing rights.
