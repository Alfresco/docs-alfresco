# Adding items to the library

Adding content items from your computer to the site library is a simple process. You can upload individual files or several files at a time.

This task assumes you are in the library of the desired site.

When performing this task you have two options: you can use the **Upload** action or—if your browser supports it—you can drag files from your computer and drop them directly into the library.

The first step in adding an item to your site library is to decide where you want it to reside. The **Library** section of the browsing pane displays the available folders. You can create new folders as necessary.

1.  Navigate the library tree structure and click the destination folder.

    When you select a folder the item list displays the current contents of that folder. When using the **Upload** action the item\(s\) you select will be added here.

    **Fastpath:** Use the drag and drop functionality to quickly and easily add content to the library. Simply locate and select the files on your computer that you want to upload, then drag them to your browser window where the application is running and drop them into the library. A blue outline appears when you hover your selection over the item list. This indicates where the files will be uploaded to. Drag the files over top of a folder to upload them to that particular folder \(ensure the **Show Folders** feature is enabled\).

    The **Upload File\(s\)** dialog box indicates the upload progress. Click **OK** when it is complete.

2.  Click **Upload**.

    The Upload File\(s\) dialog box opens.

3.  Click the browse button.

4.  Locate the file\(s\) on your computer that you want to upload and click **Open**.

    Select multiple items using the method appropriate for your operating system.

    The selected items appear in the list. Click **Remove** to delete an item from this list, if necessary.

5.  Repeat steps 3 and 4 to select additional items to upload.

6.  Once this list contains all of the items that you want to upload, click **Upload File\(s\)**.

    An indicator monitors the upload progress. You can proceed once all files display 100%.

7.  Click **OK**.


The dialog box closes and the item list displays the uploaded content item\(s\).
