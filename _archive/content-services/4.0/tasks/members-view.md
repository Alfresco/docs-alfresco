# Viewing site members

Use the Search for Site Members page to search for a particular site member. You can also choose to display a list of all site members.

This task assumes you are in the Members component of the desired site.

1.  Click **People** beneath the banner if this page is not already displayed.

2.  In the search box, type the full or partial name of the site member you want to view.

    **Tip:** Leave the search box empty to display a list of all members of the current site.

3.  Click **Search**.


The page displays a list of the site members that match the criteria provided. Within this list a site manager can change a member's role and remove a member from the site.
