# Manually running rules

When you create or edit a rule set, the rules aren't automatically applied to the existing folder items. You can manually run the rules at any time to apply them to all content. Only the items that meet the conditions will be affected.

1.  Hover over a folder with rules applied \(indicated by the ![](../images/rules-icon.png) icon\) and click ![Add Event icon](../images/AddEvent_icon.png) **More** then ![](../images/rules-icon.png) **Manage Rules**.

2.  Click **Run Rules**.

3.  Choose how you want to run the rules:

    -   **Run rules for this folder**
    -   **Run rules for this folder and its subfolders**
    A message lets you know when the rules have run.
