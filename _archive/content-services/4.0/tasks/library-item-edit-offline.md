# Editing an item offline

Use the offline editing feature to download an item to your computer. This locks the version in the library so that other users can't overwrite it while you make changes offline.

1.  In a site library find the item you want to edit offline.

2.  Hover over the item and click ![Add Event icon](../images/AddEvent_icon.png) **More** then **Edit Offline**.

    The prompts that follow vary between browsers.

3.  Follow the prompts. When asked to open or save the file, save it to your computer.

    **Note:** Depending on your browser settings, the file might be saved automatically to a default location on your computer.

    The item is added to the **Iâ€™m Editing** view. The original item is still in its original location in the library. An icon indicates to users that the item is locked by you for editing.

4.  Now you can open and edit the version you've downloaded.

    When you're done, click **Upload New Version** to upload the edited version to Alfresco.

    You can click **Cancel Editing** to unlock the item without making changes.
