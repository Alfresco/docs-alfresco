# Viewing an item in a browser

While the preview feature enables you to view and navigate a content item directly in the application, you also have the option of viewing the item in your default browser.

This task assumes you are in the library of the desired site.

1.  Navigate the libraryâ€™s folder structure to locate the content item you want to view.

2.  Position the cursor over the item of interest in the item list to display the available actions.

3.  Click **View in Browser**.

    This action is also available on the details page.

    A new browser window opens displaying the selected content item. For some file types, such as Microsoft Office documents, the application will launch the item in its associated program.
