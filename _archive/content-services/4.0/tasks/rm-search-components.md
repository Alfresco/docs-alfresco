# Searching for components

In the **Results options** section, the Components area allows you to select the type of components to search. You can search for Records, Record Folders, and Record Categories, as well as Frozen and Cut off records. For record searches, you can also search for undeclared records and vital records.

For example, to search for vital records:

1.  In the **Results options** section, select the check box for **Records**.

2.  Select the check box for **Vital**.

3.  In the **Metadata** section, select the check box for **Vital Record**.

4.  Click **Search**.


The Results tab shows the vital records \(the Vital Record field has a value of Yes\).

**Note:** The vital records that are due for review will have the ![](../images/rm-vr-dueforreview.png) icon next to Yes.
