# Deleting a comment

Delete a comment to permanently remove it from a folder or individual content item.

This task assumes you are in the library of the desired site. To perform this task on a folder the **Show Folders** feature must be enabled.

Only a Site Manager and the user who created the comment can delete it.

1.  Locate and view the content containing the comment you want to delete.

2.  Click the **Delete Comment** action to the right of the comment you want to remove.

    This action is available only when the currently logged in user has permission to delete the comment.

    A message prompts you to confirm the deletion of the selected comment.

3.  Click **Delete**.

    A message indicates the selected comment has been deleted. The comment is removed from the page.
