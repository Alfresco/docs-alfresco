Remove a user or group from a content item when you no longer want them to have access to that item.

1.  Navigate to the space containing the content item whose users you want to manage.

    The space header displays the name and details of the selected space.

2.  In the Content Itemspane, click ![View Details](../images/im-viewdetails.png) **\(View Details\)** for the content item of interest.

    The Detailspage appears.

3.  In the **Actions** list, click **Manage Content Users**.

4.  On the Manage Content Users page, click ![Change Roles](../images/im-user-modify.png) **\(Change Roles\)** for the user or group whose role you want to change.

    In this list, the icon ![User](../images/im-user.png) to the left of the name indicates a user; the icon ![Group](../images/im-group.png) indicates a group.

5.  On the Change User Rolespage, modify the roles for the selected user or group as follows:

    1.  To assign a new role for the selected user or group, click a role in the **Select role**list and click **Add to List**.

    2.  To delete an assigned role for the selected user or group, click ![Remove](../images/im-delete.png) **\(Remove\)** for that role in the **Selected roles** list.
