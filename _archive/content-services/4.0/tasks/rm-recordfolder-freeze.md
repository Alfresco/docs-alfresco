# Freezing record folders

Users with the appropriate capability \(Extend Retention Period Or Freeze\) permissions can freeze records and folders. This places a hold on the object. A hold allows objects frozen for a particular reason to be tracked as a set. Holds prevent changes to frozen objects, which have their retention schedules suspended until the hold is removed. When you freeze a folder, all records within that container are also frozen.

1.  In the File Plan, locate the record folder you want to freeze.

2.  In the item list, position the cursor over the folder of interest to display the available actions.

3.  Click **Freeze**.

    The Reason for Freeze dialog box displays.

4.  Enter the reason you are freezing the record folder and click **Freeze Record**.

    A message displays confirming that the folder is frozen.


The folder remains in its place in the File Plan. However, it also now appears in the **Holds** space.
