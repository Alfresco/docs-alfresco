# Viewing site groups

Use the Search for Site Groups page to search for a particular group that has been added to the current site. You can also choose to display a list of all groups.

This task assumes you are in the Members component of the desired site.

1.  Click **Groups** beneath the banner if this page is not already selected.

2.  In the search box, type the full or partial name of the site group you want to view.

    **Tip:** Leaving the search box empty returns a list of all groups for the current site.

3.  Click **Search**.


The page displays a list of the current site groups that match the criteria provided. Within this list a site manager can change a group's role and remove a group from the site.

Inviting users one at a time to join your site can be time consuming. To save time you can add existing user groups to the current site.
