# Selecting multiple items

Select multiple items in the current view using the item check boxes to the left of each item thumbnail or the **Select** feature at the top of the item list. You can select items, folders, or a combination of the two.

This task assumes you are in the library of the desired site. To select folders the **Show Folders** feature must be enabled.

1.  In the browsing pane select a view \(**Documents** section\), folder \(**Library** section\), or tag \(**Tags** section\) to display the desired library items.

2.  Select the desired content items in the item list:

    -   Click a check box to select the associated item.
    -   Click **Select** at the top of the item list and click the type of content you want to select: **Documents**, **Folders**, or **All**.
    Click **None** to clear the list selections. Click **Invert Selection** to toggle the check boxes to their opposite state.


The check boxes of the specified items appear selected in the item list.
