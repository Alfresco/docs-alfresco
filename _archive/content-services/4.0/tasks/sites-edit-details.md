# Editing the site details

Once you create a site you can edit the name and description from anywhere in the site. You can also change the access \(public or private\) for the site.

Only a site manager can edit the site details.

1.  Navigate to the site whose details you want to edit.

2.  On the dashboard banner, click **More** and then **Edit Site Details**.

    The Edit Site Details dialog box displays the current details for this site.

3.  Change the site **Name** and **Description** as necessary.

4.  Change the site visibility if desired.

5.  Click **OK**.


The site dashboard displays the updated details on the banner and the Site Profile dashlet.
