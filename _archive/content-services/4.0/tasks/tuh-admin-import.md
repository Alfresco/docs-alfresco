# Importing the ACP file into a space

The Import function in the Administration Console enables you to import an exported space to any space within Alfresco or into another Alfresco repository altogether.

An exported space is bundled into an Alfresco Content Package \(ACP\). Importing the ACP into a new location expands the package to the original structure of the space.

1.  Navigate to the space into which you want to import content.

    The space header displays the name and details of the space.

2.  In the toolbar, click ![Administration Console](../images/im-adminconsole.png) **\(Administration Console\)**.

3.  Click **Import**.

    The space header indicates the space into which you will import your file.

4.  Click **Browse** then locate and select the ACP file you want to import.

5.  Check **Run import in background** if you want the import to occur while you are still working.

6.  Click **OK**.

    The ACP file expands, putting the space, sub spaces, and content in the space.

7.  Click **Close** to return to the current space.
