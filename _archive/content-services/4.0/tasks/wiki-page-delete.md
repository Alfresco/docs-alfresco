# Deleting a wiki page

Delete a wiki page when you no longer want it to appear in the wiki for the current site. You can perform this task from both the wiki list and the page view.

This task assumes you are in the wiki of the desired site.

1.  In the wiki list locate the wiki page you want to delete.

2.  Click **Delete** for that page.

    **Note:** Consider viewing the page first to ensure it is the one you want to delete. You can then select **Delete** in the page view.

    If the wiki page you want to delete is already open in the page view, simply click **Delete** on that page.

    A message prompts you to confirm the deletion.

3.  Click **Delete** to delete the current wiki page.
