# Enabling Google Docs integration

The Google Docs page handles the properties for the integration of content between Google Docs and Alfresco. Use this page to enable the Google Docs integration feature.

Before you enable Google Docs integration, set up a Google Docs account that will be used for administrative purposes for the integration between Alfresco and Google Docs. This administration Google Docs account will be viewed by all Alfresco users and is intended only to be used for the documents that you want to share between Alfresco and Google Docs.

1.  Open the Admin Console, and then click **Google Docs**.

2.  On the Google Docs page, click **Edit**.

    You see the Edit: Google Docs page.

3.  Set the Google Docs properties.
