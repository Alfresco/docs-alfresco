# Deleting a site

    The Site Finder page displays.

2.  Search for a specific site or display all sites you have permission to access.

    The results list appears beneath the search box. If you have permission to delete a site, the **Delete** action displays for that site.

3.  Click **Delete** for the site you want to delete.

    A message prompts you to confirm the deletion.

4.  Click **Delete** to delete the selected site.

    A message informs you that the selected action deletes all site content.
