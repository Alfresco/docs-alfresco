# Viewing a workflow

From the Workflows I’ve Started page, you can view the full details of a workflow, including a workflow summary, details on the most recently completed task, and a summary of all tasks generated by the workflow.

Viewing a workflow lets you confirm you have selected the correct one before you cancel it.
