# Navigating to a site

You can navigate to a site from your personal dashboard and from the Site Finder page.

Most often you will be visiting sites that you belong to. Therefore, the most convenient way to navigate to a site is from the My Sites dashlet on your dashboard. If the site you want to access doesn't appear in your site list, you can search for it on the Site Finder page.

1.  Click **My Dashboard** on the toolbar if your personal dashboard isn't already displayed.

2.  On the My Sites dashlet click the name of the site you want to navigate to.

    **Note:** If the site doesn't exist, click **Create Site** on this dashlet or in the **Sites** menu to create it yourself.


The dashboard for the selected site appears. This is called the site dashboard.
