# Creating a list of values

Creating a list is a two step process. First you create the empty list and then you edit it to add the values. Once you create a list, you cannot delete it.

This task assumes that you are on the Lists page of the Records Management Console.

1.  Click **New List**.

    The New List dialog box displays.

2.  In the **Name** field, enter a name for the list.

    **Note:** The list name must be unique.

3.  Click **OK**.


The name of the new list displays on the Lists page.
