# Reapplying rules

When you add rules to a space that already contains content, the rules are not applied to the existing content by default. You must reapply the rules to that space to ensure the existing content is included.

1.  Navigate to the space whose content rules you want to manage.

    The space header displays the name and details of the space.

2.  In the **More Actions** menu, click **Manage Content Rules**.

3.  In the **More Actions** menu of the Content Rules page, click **Reapply Rules In Space** or **Reapply Rules in Space and Children**.

    You are notified when the rules have been reapplied.

4.  Click **Close** to return to the current space.
