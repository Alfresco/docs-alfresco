2.  Position your cursor over the link to display the available actions and then click **Edit**.

    **Note:** Consider viewing the link first to ensure it is the one you want to edit. You can then select **Edit** on the link view page.

    The Edit Link page appears displaying the selected link.

3.  Make the desired changes to the link details.

4.  Edit the tags for this link as necessary.

    You can add and remove existing tags, or create new tags.
