# Checking out content

When editing content, you can check out a content item to prevent other users from overwriting your work.

Checking out content locks the original file and creates a working copy that you work with.

1.  Navigate to the space containing the content item you want to check out.

2.  Click ![Menu](../images/im-menu.png) for that content item and click **Check Out**.

3.  On the Check Out page, choose where you want to keep the working copy and click **Check Out**.

    You can keep the working copy in the current space, where the original content item resides, or in another space within the repository. The working copy has the same name as the original content item but is appended with **\(Working Copy\)**.

4.  The Check Out page provides several options. Perform the desired option:

    -   To download the working copy to your computer immediately, click the working copy of the file and save it to your computer. Once the download is complete, click **Open** to open the file for editing.
    -   To edit the content at another time, click **OK** to copy the working copy of the file to the specified space. When you are ready to edit the content, you will need to download the file to your computer.
    -   To cancel the checkout, click **Undo Check Out**. No working copy of the file is created.
    The icon ![Locked by You](../images/im-lockedbyuser.png) beside a content item indicates it is locked by you; the icon ![Locked by Other](../images/im-lockedbyother.png) indicates it is locked by another user. Position your mouse over the icon to display the name of the user who checked out the item.
