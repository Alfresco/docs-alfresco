# Editing folder or item properties

From the details page you can edit the properties of the currently displayed folder or content item. The fields displayed on this page vary depending on how the properties have been customized.

This task assumes you are in the library of the desired site. To perform this task on a folder the **Show Folders** feature must be enabled.

1.  Locate and view the folder or content item whose properties you want to edit.

2.  On the details page click **Edit Properties**.

    The Edit Properties page displays the current properties configured.

3.  Edit the properties on this page as desired.

    The **Name** does not support the following special characters: \* " < \> \\ / . ? : and \|. When the name contains a disallowed character the **Save** button is disabled.

    **Note:** There is an exception regarding the period: the folder name can include a period as long as it is not the last character.

4.  Click **Select** beneath the **Tags** label to edit the tag associations. You can add and remove existing tags, and create new tags.

    On the Select page the left column displays the existing tags for the current site. The right column displays the tags already associated with the folder or item.

    1.  To create a new tag type the tag name in the empty box provided and click the **Create new item** icon \(or press ENTER\). You can create only one tag at a time in this field. Multi-word tags are accepted and do not need to be entered within quotation marks. Creating a new tag automatically associates it with the current folder or item.

    2.  To add an existing tag browse the left column and click the **Add** icon to the right of the tag\(s\) you wish to associate with the current folder or item.

    3.  To remove an existing tag browse the right column and click the **Remove** icon to the right of the tag\(s\) you no longer want to be associated with the folder or item.

    4.  Click **OK** to save the changes.

    **Tip:** The inline tagging feature lets you add, edit, and delete tags directly in the library item list \(detailed view only\).

5.  Click **Select** beneath the **Categories** label to edit the categories associated with the current folder or item. You can add and remove categories.

    On the Select page the left column displays the available categories; click a category to display its subcategories.

    The button at the top of the list indicates your current location in the category hierarchy. Click this button to display the full path; click an entry to return to that point in the path. Click the up arrow to return to the previous level in the hierarchy.

    The right column displays the categories already associated with the folder or item.

    1.  To add a category navigate the category hierarchy in the left column and click the **Add** icon to the right of the categories you wish to associate with the current folder or item.

    2.  To remove an existing category click the **Remove** icon to the right of a category in the right column that you no longer want to be associated with the folder or item.

    3.  Click **OK** to save the changes.

6.  Click **Save**.

    The page closes and the **Properties** section of the details page displays the updated information.

7.  In the header click the desired folder in the breadcrumb path to return to the item list for that folder.
