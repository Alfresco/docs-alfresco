# Adding the Records Management dashlet

When you have installed the Records Management module and restarted your server, the next step is to add the Records Management dashlet into your personal dashboard.

Before you start these steps, ensure that you have applied the Records Management AMPs to your Alfresco installation, and then restarted the Alfresco server.

The Records Management dashlet lets you create the pre-defined Share site for Records Management functionality.

1.  Start Alfresco Share, and then login using your administrator credentials.

2.  Click **Customize Dashboard**.

3.  Click **Add Dashlets**.

4.  Locate the Records Management Config dashlet in the Add Dashlets list.

5.  Drag the Records Management Config dashlet to where you want the dashlet to be placed on your dashboard.

6.  Click **OK**.


The Records Management dashlet displays in your dashboard. Initially, you'll see that the only option is to **Create Records Management Site**. When you have created the site, you'll also see some additional actions that let you manage the Records Management site and users.
