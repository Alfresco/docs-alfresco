# Editing a rule

You might need to revisit your rules from time to time and make some changes to keep them current. If you donâ€™t want to use a specific rule anymore but think you may need it again in the future, you can just disable it.

1.  Hover over a folder with rules applied \(indicated by the ![](../images/rules-icon.png) icon\) and click ![Add Event icon](../images/AddEvent_icon.png) **More** then ![](../images/rules-icon.png) **Manage Rules**.

2.  On the left side of the page, click the rule you want to edit.

    **Note:** You can't edit linked or inherited rules here; that has to be done in the folder where they were created.

3.  Click **Edit**.

4.  Make your changes. You can edit any of the rule details: name, description, rule definition, and options.

5.  Click **Save**.
