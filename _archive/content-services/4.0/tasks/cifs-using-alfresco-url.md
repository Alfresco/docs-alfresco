# Open Alfresco in a browser window

You can use the Alfresco.url to open the Alfresco repository in a browser window.

**Note:** The Alfresco.url is a shortcut to Alfresco. It is available in a Windows environment if the Alfresco repository has been mapped by your administrator so that you can access it from Windows Explorer.

1.  In Windows Explorer go to the location in the Alfresco repository that you want to open.

2.  Double-click the Alfresco.url.

    **Note:** There is a copy of the Alfresco.url at each level of the repository.

    The Alfresco repository will open in a browser window, showing the location where you clicked on the Alfresco.url.
