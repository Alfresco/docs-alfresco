# Deleting a saved search

You can delete any of your own saved searches. With correct permissions, you can also delete the default searches included with the Records Management site.

This task assumes you are on the Search page.

1.  Click the **Saved Searches** menu to view the available search queries.

2.  Select the query you want to delete.

    The **Critera** tab displays the query syntax and options. Take a moment to review this information to make sure this is the search you want to delete.

3.  Click **Delete Search**.

4.  Click **Remove** to confirm the deletion.
