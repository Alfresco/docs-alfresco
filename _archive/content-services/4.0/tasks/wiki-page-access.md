# Accessing the wiki

Access the wiki to view the wiki content related to the current site. Within the wiki you can create, delete, rename, and edit the wiki pages. You can perform most actions from both the wiki list and the page view.

Within the wiki you can create and edit wiki pages, as well as rename and delete any pages that you created.

1.  Navigate to the desired site.

2.  Click **Wiki** on the navigation bar.

    **Note:** Within each site the component names can be customized. If the site manager has done this, the link in the navigation bar may have a label other than **Wiki**.

    This opens the wiki which displays the main wiki page for this site. When viewing a wiki page the actions you can perform appear as buttons beneath the banner \(**New Page**, **Delete**, **Rename**\) and as links at the top right of the content area \(**View Page**, **Edit Page**, **Details**\).

3.  Click **Wiki Page List**to display the wiki list.

    The wiki list displays a summary of all pages in the wiki for the current site. In this view, the actions you can perform on a wiki page appear as buttons beneath the banner \(only **New Page** is available in this view\) and as links to the right of each page summary. You can perform most actions from both the wiki list and the page view.
