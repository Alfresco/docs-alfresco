# Duplicating a list item

Quickly and easily create a new list item by duplicating an existing item in the same list. This is a particularly useful action if the two items have similar details.

This task assumes you are viewing the data lists for the desired site and the list you want to work with is displayed.

1.  Position your cursor over the list item you want to duplicate to display the available actions.

2.  Click the **Duplicate** action.

    The new item is created. Its details are identical to the selected list item.

3.  Edit the new list item as necessary.
