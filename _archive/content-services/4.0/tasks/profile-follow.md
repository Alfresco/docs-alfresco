# Following users

Follow users whose activities might be of specific interest to you. You can follow any number of users.

Once you have chosen some users to follow, you can view their activities on both the personal and site dashboards. Use the filters on the My Activities and Site Activities dashlets to view only the information generated by the people you are following.

1.  Locate the user you want to follow in one of the following ways:

    -   Click **People** on the toolbar and perform a user search on the People Finder page.
    -   Anywhere you see the name of the user you want to follow, click the name to navigate to their profile page.
2.  In the list of search results or on the user's profile page, click **Follow**.

    The user will receive an email notification that you are now following them. You cannot follow a user without them knowing.

3.  Navigate to the I'm Following page of your user profile.

    This page displays all users you are currently following.

4.  Enable the **Private** check box to prevent others from viewing this list.

    **Note:** Even when your list is private, email notifications will be sent to people you choose to follow.

    When your list is private, the Following page doesn't appear when people view your user profile.

5.  Manage the people you are following on this list by clicking **Unfollow** to remove anyone you no longer want to follow.
