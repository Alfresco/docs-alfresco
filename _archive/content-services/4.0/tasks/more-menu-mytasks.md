# My Tasks

The My Tasks page lets you view and manage the tasks that are assigned to you. On this page you can view a summary of your tasks, filter the task list, and access the actions for managing your tasks.

1.  On the toolbar expand the **More** menu and click **My Tasks**.

    **Tip:** You can also access this page from your personal dashboard: click **All Tasks** on the My Tasks dashlet.

    The My Tasks page appears displaying a list of all tasks currently assigned to you. The summary provided for each task includes:

    -   task name
    -   due date
    -   current status of the task
    -   task type
    -   priority \(displayed as an icon that indicates the task is of high, medium, or low priority\)
    An icon \(![](../images/im-pooled.png)\) indicates a pooled task. Pooled tasks that can be claimed are marked as **Unassigned**.

    Where the list contains more tasks than can be displayed on a single page, navigation links appear at the top of the task list. The number in bold indicates your current page. Click a page number to display a specific page. Use the previous \(<<\) and next \(\>\>\) links to move forward and backward through multiple pages of tasks.

2.  Use the filters provided to view a subset of the tasks.

    The browsing pane on the left side of the page enables you to display a specific set of tasks. The options are:

    -   **Tasks**

        Display all tasks

    -   **Due**

        Filter tasks by due date: **Today**, **Tomorrow**, **Next 7 Days**, **Overdue**, **No Date**

    -   **Priority**

        Filter tasks by priority: **High**, **Medium**, **Low**

    -   **Assignee**

        Filter tasks by assignee: view tasks assigned to you or view pooled tasks that are unassigned

3.  Manage your tasks.

    Position your cursor over a task to reveal the available actions:

    -   **Edit Task**: Allows you to edit the task
    -   **View Task**: Displays the task details
    -   **View Workflow**: Displays the workflow details
    **Note:** On this page you can click **Start Workflow** beneath the banner to initiate a new workflow.


-   **[Viewing tasks and workflows](../tasks/more-menu-mytasks-view.md)**  
From the My Tasks page you can view the details for an individual task or for the workflow that initiated a task.
-   **[Editing a task](../tasks/more-menu-mytasks-edit.md)**  
Tasks assigned to you appear in two places: the My Tasks personal dashlet and the My Tasks page. Each task is your responsibility and remains assigned to you until you manage it.
