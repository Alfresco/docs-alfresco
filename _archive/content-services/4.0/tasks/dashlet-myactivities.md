# My Activities dashlet

The My Activities dashlet lets you easily follow what is going on in the sites you belong to.

The information displayed here includes changes in both library content \(items added, edited, and deleted\) and site membership \(users joining and leaving sites\). Activities are also recorded when members like and comment on library items.

On this dashlet you can:

-   Use the filter to display the activities by ownership, type, and time period. You can display only your activities, only other usersâ€™ activities, or all activities. You can also view only a specific type of activity, such as changes in membership or status updates.

-   Click the RSS Feed icon to subscribe to the feed to automatically receive the activity updates.
