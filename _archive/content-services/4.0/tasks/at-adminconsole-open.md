# Opening the Admin Console

You can only see the Admin Console if you are an administrator user or a user who is a member of the `ALFRESCO_ADMINISTRATORS` group.

1.  On the toolbar, expand the **More** menu, and then click **More** in the **Admin Tools...** list.

2.  Click the tools on the left navigation bar.

    You see the various tools available and the options that you can set.

    Alternatively, you can select a number of the tools directly from the **More** menu. The **More** menu shows the most commonly used tools in the Admin Console, for example:

    -   **Application**
    -   **Groups**
    -   **Replication Jobs**
    -   **Repository**
    -   **Trashcan**
    -   **Users**
