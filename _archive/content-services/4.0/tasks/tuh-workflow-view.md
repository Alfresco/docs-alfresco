# Viewing the workflow steps for a content item

You can easily determine if a content item is part of a workflow by viewing the content item's details.

Access the View Details page to view a summary of the workflow defined for a content item. The **Workflows** pane details both the simple workflow and the advanced workflow for the item.

This feature is not applicable to WCM content. Within a web project, you view – and have the opportunity to configure – the workflow as part of the Submit action.

1.  Navigate to the content item whose workflow you want to view.

2.  In the Content Items pane, click ![View Details](../images/im-viewdetails.png) **\(View Details\)** for that item.

3.  In the Workflows pane, click ![Expand](../images/im-expand.png) to expand the pane, if it is not open, and review the defined workflow.

4.  Click **Close** to return to the current space.
