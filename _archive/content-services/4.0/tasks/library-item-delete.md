# Deleting content

Delete content to permanently remove it from a site library. Deleting a folder removes both the folder and its contents from the library.

This task assumes you are in the library of the desired site. To perform this task on a folder the **Show Folders** feature must be enabled.

This feature is also available for multiple selections.

1.  Navigate the libraryâ€™s folder structure to locate the content item or folder you want to work with.

2.  Position the cursor over the content of interest in the item list to display the available actions.

3.  Click **More** and then **Delete Document** or **Delete Folder**.

    A message prompts you to confirm the deletion.

4.  Click **Delete**.

    The item or folder is deleted from the library.
