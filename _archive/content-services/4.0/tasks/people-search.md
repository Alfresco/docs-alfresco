# Searching for a user

Use the People Finder feature to search for a particular user.

1.  Click **People** on the toolbar.

    The People Finder page appears.

2.  In the search box, type the full or partial name of the user you are looking for.

    You must enter a minimum of one \(1\) character. The search is not case sensitive.

    **Note:** Refer to the search tips provided on the People Finder page to perform more complex searches by both name and property.

3.  Click **Search**.

    The results list appears beneath the search box and displays all users matching the search criteria provided. Use the **Follow** and **Unfollow** buttons to the right of each user to begin or stop following people.

4.  In this list, click a user name to display that user's profile. The user details are organized across multiple pages: **Info**, **Sites**, **Content**., and **Following**.

5.  Navigate the pages to view the details for the selected user.
