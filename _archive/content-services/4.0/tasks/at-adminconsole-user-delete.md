# Deleting a user account

Delete a user account to remove the user from the system.

**Note:** Deleting a user does not remove their permissions from the repository. These permissions are reused if the user is recreated in the future. To keep an account but stop the user having access to the application, consider disabling the user account instead.

1.  Open the Admin Console, and then click **Users**.

    You see the User Search page.

2.  Search for a user, and then select the user.

3.  On the User Profile page, click **Delete User**.

    A message prompts you to confirm that you want to delete the user account.

4.  Click **Delete**.
