# View item details from a mapped drive

You can use the ShowDetails.exe to view item details and properties.

**Note:** The ShowDetails.exe is available in a Windows environment if the Alfresco repository has been mapped by your administrator so that you can access it from Windows Explorer.

1.  Select a file in the mapped Alfresco repository in Windows Explorer or your desktop.

2.  Drag the file from the mapped Alfresco repository onto the ShowDetails.exe.

    **Note:** There is a copy of the ShowDetails.exe at each level of the repository.

    A new browser window opens showing the Alfresco document preview, where you can see a preview of the document and view document properties.
