# Managing rules

For a folder with rules, use the **Manage Rules** action to view and maintain the rule set.

The options on the Rules page differ depending on whether the folder has its own rules or is linked to rules set up for another folder.

-   **[Working with a defined rule set](../concepts/library-folder-rules-defined.md)**  
You can easily view and maintain the individual rules that makes up the rule set. You can add, edit, and delete rules, make a rule inactive, and change the run order. You can also manually run rules.
-   **[Working with linked rules](../concepts/library-folder-rules-linked.md)**  
You don't have as many editing options when your folder has linked rules. You can either link to a different rule set or you can break the link completely.
