# Cancelling a workflow

Cancel an existing workflow when it is no longer required. This deletes all tasks related to the workflow.

This task assumes you are on the Workflows I've Started page.

1.  In the workflow list locate the workflow you want to cancel and position your cursor over it to reveal the available actions.

2.  Click **Cancel Workflow**.

    A message prompts you to confirm the action.

3.  Click **Yes**.

    The selected workflow is cancelled and removed from the workflow list. All tasks related to the workflow are deleted, which removes them from the assigneesâ€™ task lists.
