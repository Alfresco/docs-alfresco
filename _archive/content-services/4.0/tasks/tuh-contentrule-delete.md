# Deleting a content rule

If you no longer need an existing content rule, you can delete it.

If there is a chance you might need the rule again, you may want to edit the rule and make use of the option to disable it instead.

You cannot delete a rule inherited from a parent space.

1.  Navigate to the space containing the rule you want to delete.

2.  In the **More Actions** menu, click **Manage Content Rules**.

3.  On the Content Rules page, locate the rule you want to delete and click ![Delete](../images/im-delete.png) **\(Delete\)**. A message prompts you to confirm the deletion of the selected rule.

4.  Click **Yes**.

5.  Click **Close** to return to the current space.
