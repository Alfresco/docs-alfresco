# Adding a translation without content

Adding a translation without content enables you to give other language equivalent values to all the properties and then add the translated content later when available. This is useful when using workflow to manage the translation process.

1.  On the Manage Multilingual Content page, click **Add Translation Without Content** in the **Actions** list.

2.  On the Add Translation Without Content page, verify the properties and ensure all required fields are complete.

3.  Select the language of the translated content.

4.  Uncheck **Modify all properties when this page closes** and click **OK**.

    The new content placeholder displays in the space with the language code identified. If you have set your **Content Language** option on the User Profile and Settings page to a specific language, you will only see the document for that language.
