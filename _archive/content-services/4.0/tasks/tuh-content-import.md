# Importing the ACP file into a space

Use the Import function to copy an exported space to a new location within Alfresco.

Importing the ACP into a new location expands the package to the original structure of the space.

1.  Navigate to the space into which you want to import content.

    The space header displays the name and details of the space.

2.  In the **More Actions** menu, click **View Details**.

    The Details page appears.

3.  In the **Actions** list, click **Import**.

    The Import page appears.

4.  Click **Browse** and locate the ACP file you want to import.

5.  Check **Run import in background** if you want the import to occur while you are still working.

6.  Click **OK**.

    The ACP file expands, putting the space, sub spaces, and content in the space.
