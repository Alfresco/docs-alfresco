# Debugging an upgrade

The startup log is important to help Alfresco Support diagnose any issues that might arise as a result of the upgrade.

1.  Immediately after starting the Alfresco server, make a copy of the alfresco.log file.

2.  Make a copy of the temporary files that contain the SQL statements executed by the upgrade.

    The locations of the temporary files are written to the alfresco.log file.

3.  Submit the log file and SQL temporary files to Alfresco Support.
