# Closing a record folder

Users with the appropriate capability \(Folder Control\) permissions can close folders. Closed folders cannot accept any further records.

1.  In the File Plan, locate the record folder you want to close.

2.  In the item list, position the cursor over the folder of interest to display the available actions.

3.  Click **Close Folder**.

    A message displays confirming that the folder is closed.

    **Note:** The action for this folder changes to **Re-open Folder**, which allows the folder to be reopened.
