# Viewing a link

The main view of the links component displays the existing links for this site. You can choose a summary view or a simple list. Viewing a link enables you to see the full link details as well as any comments that have been added.

This task assumes you are viewing the links for the desired site.

Although you can perform actions on a link from the main page, you may want to view the link before you edit or delete it in order to confirm that you have selected the correct one.

1.  Browse the links to locate the one you want to view.

2.  Click the title of the link to display the full details.

    The link view displays the selected link in its entirety, along with any comments that have been added.

3.  Click **Links List** to return to the main view.
