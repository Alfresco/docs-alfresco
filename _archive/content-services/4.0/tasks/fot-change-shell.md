# Changing the default shell \(Unix/Linux/Solaris\) for shell scripts

When you run Alfresco on the Unix, Linux, or Solaris operating systems, the default shell is sh. You can edit the alfresco.sh file to change to your preferred shell.

1.  Open the alfresco.sh file.

    These steps also apply to any shell script, for example: apply\_amps.sh or deploy\_start.sh.

2.  Edit the shell command to specify your preferred shell.

    For example, change the `#!/bin/sh` line to `#!/bin/bash`.

3.  Save the alfresco.sh file.
