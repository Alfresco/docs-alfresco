# Downloading the JMX dump

When you make configuration changes in the Admin Console, the current values of your running system are stored in an area in the JMX interface. When talking to Alfresco Support, it may be convenient to have a dump of these settings.

The **Repository Tools** provides a web JMX dumper so you can easily access this information.

1.  Open the Admin Console, and then click **Repository Tools**.

2.  Click the **Download JMX Zip Dump** link.

3.  Save the file on to your computer.

    The saved .zip file has the name **jmxdump** appended with the current date \(in the format YYYY\_MM\_DD\).

4.  Extract the file and open the .txt file with your preferred program.
