# Adding a comment

In the library you can add a comment to a folder or individual content item.

This task assumes you are in the library of the desired site. To perform this task on a folder the **Show Folders** feature must be enabled.

1.  Locate and view the content you want to comment on.

    **Note:** The comment feature is also available on the Recently Modified Documents dashlet on the site dashboard and in the library item list. In both cases the detailed view must be selected.

2.  On the details page click **Comment** above the preview pane.

    This scrolls you to the bottom of the page and opens the comment box. The existing comments appear beneath this with up to ten comments displayed per page. When more comments exist, navigation links appear at the top and bottom of the list. The most recent comment appears at the top of the list.

3.  Enter your comments in the box provided.

    Use the features provided to format the text; insert bulleted and numbered lists; and change the font color. To assist with editing use the undo, redo, and remove formatting features as needed.

4.  Click **Add Comment**.

    Your comment appears at the top of the list. Edit Comment and Delete Comment actions are available for each entry, where appropriate. Only the Site Manager and the user who created the comment can perform these actions.
