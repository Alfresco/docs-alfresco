-   **RBAC**

    See Role Based Access Control.

-   **Records Management**

    Alfresco Records Management \(RM\) is a solution for managing the life cycle of electronic and other types of records.

-   **regex**

    A regex \(regular expression\) is a sequence of characters that form a search pattern. Also written in capitals \(REGEX\).

-   **Remote API**

    A remote API allows a client connecting from a separate tier to communicate with the content application server. Remote APIs are based on web services and RESTful and CMIS protocols, and are language agnostic, allowing you to develop against these APIs using a range of languages including Java, PHP, Ruby, and .NET. Alfresco Content Services provides several remote APIs.

-   **Remote Method Invocation**

    Remote Method Invocation \(RMI\) allows you to write distributed objects using Java.

-   **rendition**

    A rendition is an alternative representation of a content node. Renditions are derived from their source nodes and are usually updated automatically when their source node is updated. In the context of Media Management, renditions are different editions or versions of an asset; for example, an alternative file format. See [proxy](glossary_p.md#proxy).

-   **repository**

    The Alfresco Content Services repository is the combination of the content, the indexes, and the database. It contains a collection of Stores. The repository architecture is based on the Spring framework. Every part of the repository is either a component or a service.

-   **REST architecture**

    Representational state transfer \(REST\) is a style of software architecture for distributed hypermedia systems such as the World Wide Web. The Alfresco Content Services RESTful API provides access to its services via HTTP. The REST API is built upon the Alfresco Content Services web scripts platform allowing customization and extension of the API.

-   **RM**

    See Records Management.

-   **RMI**

    See Remote Method Invocation.

-   **Role Based Access Control**

    Role Based Access Control \(RBAC\) is a means of restricting user access to a system or systems.

-   **rsync**

    Rsync is a Unix-based algorithm that quickly synchronizes local and remote files and directories. Rsync sends only file differences across the network instead of complete files.

-   **rule**

    A rule is an action or a composite action with a rule type. Every rule has a rule type and it characterizes the types of events in the repository that will cause the rule to be triggered.

    When a rule is triggered the composite action it represents is executed. A rule type is made up of a number of rule triggers. A rule trigger relates to a repository policy and transforms the information acquired when that policy is fired into the information needed to trigger a rule.
