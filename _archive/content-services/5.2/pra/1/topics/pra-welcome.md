# ReST APIs

The ReST APIs lets you access content in an on-premise repository from your own applications. The APIs are ReSTful, which means each call is an HTTP request, so you don't even need a programming language to try it out. You can just type a URL address in a web browser. There are two types of ReST APIs, the Alfresco ReST API and the standard CMIS ReST API.

## Alfresco ReST API

Use the Alfresco ReST API version 1.0 when developing remote clients. The quickest way to get started is to use the [User Guide](../../../concepts/dev-api-by-language-alf-rest.md) with the [ReST API Explorer](../concepts/pra-rest-api-explorer.md) as a Reference Guide, based on the [OpenAPI initiative](https://openapis.org/). It gives you full documentation for each endpoint, and a **Try it out!** button so you can use each method.

## CMIS ReST API

Use the [CMIS ReST API](cmis-welcome.md) for use cases that require portability between different ECM systems.

-   **[Alfresco ReST API](../../../pra/1/topics/pra-welcome-aara.md)**  
The ReST API lets you manage Alfresco Content Services-specific features of content in an on-premise repository from your own applications.
-   **[CMIS REST API](../../../pra/1/topics/cmis-welcome.md)**  
Alfresco fully implements both the CMIS 1.0 and 1.1 standards to allow your application to manage content and metadata in a repository. This section gives a brief overview of the URL format for CMIS REST API calls, and explains the format of responses.
