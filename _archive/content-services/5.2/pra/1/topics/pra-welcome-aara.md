# Alfresco ReST API

The ReST API lets you manage Alfresco Content Services-specific features of content in an on-premise repository from your own applications.

The API gives your application access to folders, files, sites, containers, comments, ratings, tags, and workflow objects. Response and request bodies are all specified with simple JSON. There are two main APIs that you can use, the Alfresco ReST API and the CMIS standard.

-   **[The ReST API Explorer](../../../pra/1/concepts/pra-rest-api-explorer.md)**  
The ReST API Explorer documents all the API methods available to you, and lets you try those methods out.
