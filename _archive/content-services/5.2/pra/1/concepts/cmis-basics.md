# CMIS basics

CMIS is built around a number of concepts. This information provides an overview of those that are shared between all CMIS versions.

-   **[CMIS repository](../../../pra/1/concepts/cmis-concepts.md)**  
At the root of the CMIS model and services is a repository, which is an instance of the content management system and its store of metadata, content, and indexes.
-   **[CMIS query](../../../pra/1/concepts/cmis-query.md)**  
A CMIS query is based upon SQL-92. The query is read-only and presents no data manipulation capabilities.
-   **[CMIS services](../../../pra/1/concepts/cmis-services-about.md)**  
CMIS provides services that you can access using SOAP or AtomPub, depending on your preferred architectural style.
-   **[CMIS object model](../../../pra/1/concepts/cmis-objects.md)**  
The CMIS object model is similar to the Alfresco object model without the support of aspects. It supports versioning, policy, document, and folder objects.
-   **[CMIS bindings](../../../pra/1/concepts/cmis-bindings.md)**  
Clients can communicate with a CMIS repository using one of three protocol bindings: AtomPub, SOAP Web Services, and in CMIS 1.1, the Browser binding, which is the recommended binding to use. CMIS repositories provide a service endpoint, or URL, for each of these bindings.
