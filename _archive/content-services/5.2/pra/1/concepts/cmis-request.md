# What does a request look like?

You call a method on the CMIS AtomPub REST API by issuing an authenticated HTTP request with a URL.

The four HTTP methods are used to support the traditional Create, Read, Update, and Delete \(CRUD\) operations of content management:

-   **POST**

    is used to create a new entities

-   **GET**

    is used to retrieve information

-   **PUT**

    is used to update a single entity

-   **DELETE**

    is used to delete a single entity


-   **[Request URL format](../../../pra/1/concepts/cmis-request-url-format.md)**  
Each request is a URL with a specific format. The format is dependent on the type of target repository.
