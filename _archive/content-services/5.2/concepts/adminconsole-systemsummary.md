# Viewing the System Summary

System Summary in the Admin Console shows an overview of the status of the repository, including the general system information, subsystem status, clustering settings, the current authentication chain, and details of which AMPs are applied to the system.

There are no actions or entry fields on the System Summary page. This page is a high-level overview of the setting you have chosen or are set as default on the repository.

The overview is divided into the following sections:

-   System information
-   File Systems
-   Transformation Services
-   Indexing Subsystem
-   Repository Clustering
-   Activities Feed
-   Authentication
-   Email
-   Auditing Services
-   Content Stores
-   Alfresco Module Packages \(AMPs\)
-   Users and Groups
