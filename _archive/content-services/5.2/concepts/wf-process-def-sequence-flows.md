# Sequence flows

A sequence flow is the connector between two elements of a process.

After an element is visited during process execution, all outgoing sequence flows will be followed. So by default two outgoing sequence flows will create two separate, parallel paths of execution. This behavior can be modified. Sequence flows are described in detail in the Activiti user guide.
