# Auditing Tutorials

The Audit ReST API User Guide contains a lot of example tutorials.

The Audit ReST API User Guide can be found [user guide](dev-api-by-language-alf-rest-manage-audit-apps-intro.md).

-   **[Understanding PathMappings](../tasks/audit-pathmappings.md)**  
To create an audit configuration file, it is necessary to know which data can be audited and how the data is mapped onto your application.
-   **[Using values that have changed in a post method call](../tasks/audit-post-method-call.md)**  
When using the `org.alfresco.repo.audit.AuditMethodInterceptor` Data Producer, which generates audit data for all public service API calls, it is sometimes useful to be able to audit before and after values in a 'post' call application, or to include values from before the call.
