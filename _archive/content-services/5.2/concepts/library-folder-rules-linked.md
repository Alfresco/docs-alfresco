# Working with linked rules

When a folder has linked rules there are less editing options than when it has its own set of rules. You can either link to a different rule set or you can break the link completely.

When you select the **Manage Rules** action for a folder with linked rules, the Rules page shows the name and path of the folder whose rule set is being referenced.

**Note:** The folder might also inherit rules from a parent folder. A message lets you know if this is the case.

Changes to the rule set have to be done in the folder where the rules were originally defined. It's easy to get to the Rules page for the source folder: just click **View Rule Set**.

-   **[Linking to a different rule set](../tasks/library-folder-rules-change-link.md)**  
If you want to change the rules you're linked to, you can easily link to a different rule set.
-   **[Breaking the link to a rule set](../tasks/library-folder-rules-break-link.md)**  
If you don't need your rules anymore, breaking the link is just a single click away. This leaves the folder without any rules.
