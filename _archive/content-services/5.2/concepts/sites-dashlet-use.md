# What can I do with the site dashlets?

As well as giving you an overview of activity and information on Alfresco Share, the dashlets also give you links to various areas of Share and let you carry out a range of actions.

**Tip:** When a user name, site name, or item appears as a link, you can click it to navigate to the related page. When you hover over some dashlets additional options are displayed.

**Note:**

The RSS Feed, Alfresco Add-ons RSS Feed, and Web View site dashlets on the site dashboard are identical to those on your personal dashboard.

The My Discussions, Site Search, and Saved Search dashlets are identical to those on your user dashboard, but on the site dashboard the results displayed are specific to the current site.

Any combination of the site dashlets can appear on the dashboard:

-   **Site Members**

    Displays the current members of this site \(to a maximum of 100 members\) and their assigned roles.

    -   Click a member’s name to view their user profile.
