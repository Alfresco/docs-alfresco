# Hot Threads

Use this tool to see the five threads that are consuming the most processing power.

When you open the Hot Threads screen it displays a stack trace of the current five highest consuming threads \(hot threads\). You can:

-   **Get Hot Threads**

    Open a new tab displaying the current five hot threads at the time you open the tab. The highest consuming threads will change over time so each tab will contain different data. You can open as many tabs as required.

-   **Save Current Hot Threads Report**

    Download a text file with details of the currently displayed report tab.

-   **Save All**

    Download a text file with details of all the report tabs.
