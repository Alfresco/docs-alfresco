# Using Alfresco Content Services from Microsoft Office

With Alfresco Office Services \(AOS\) you can access content directly from your Microsoft Office applications.

This means that you can browse, open, and save Microsoft Office files \(Word, PowerPoint, and Excel\) in Alfresco Content Services without the need to access Alfresco Share through Chrome, Firefox, or another web browser.

You can also browse content from Windows Explorer, or map a network drive.

For more information about Alfresco Office Services, see [Alfresco Office Services](http://docs.alfresco.com/aos/concepts/aos-user.html).
