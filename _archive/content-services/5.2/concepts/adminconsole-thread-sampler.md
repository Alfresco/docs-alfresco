# Thread Sampler

Use this tool to see what each system thread is doing.

All threads are included in the sampler, with statuses of running, waiting, timed waiting, and blocked. You can:

-   Click **Start Thread Sampler** to open a new thread sample. New thread samples are displayed according to the sample rate you select. Click **Stop Thread Sampler** as required.
-   Click on a thread to see its stack trace
-   Click **Save All** to download a .json file of the thread samples
-   Click **Upload All** to upload and analyze a thread list that you've previously downloaded

**Note:** If a thread hasn't changed since the previous stack trace it displays the < symbol.
