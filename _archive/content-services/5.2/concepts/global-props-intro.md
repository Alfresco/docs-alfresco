# Using the alfresco-global.properties file

The global properties alfresco-global.properties file contains the customizations for extending Alfresco Content Services.

If you install using one of the installation wizards, the alfresco-global.properties file is modified with the settings that you chose during installation. If you install manually using the WAR file, you can modify properties in the alfresco-global.properties file.

A sample global properties file is supplied with the installation. By default, the file contains sample settings for running Alfresco Content Services, for example, the location of the content and index data, the database connection properties, the location of third-party software, and database driver properties.
