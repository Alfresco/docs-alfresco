# Web Quick Start

Web Quick Start is an easy-to-install package that provides developers with a strong starting point for their Alfresco Content Services implementations.

Web Quick Start is packaged in four parts:

-   An Alfresco Module Package \(AMP\) that extends the repository to support a generic website model
-   An AMP that extends Alfresco Share for editing content for the website, managing the structure of the website, and publishing content using workflow.
-   A JAR file that contains a Java API for accessing the website data held in the repository.
-   A web application that, when deployed to a servlet container such as Tomcat, delivers a fictional financial news website. The web application is a Spring MVC application constructed using Alfresco Surf, and communicating with the repository using the Java API. As well as dynamically building the website from data held in the repository, Web Quick Start also provides examples of user generated content whereby content is sent from the web application back to the repository.

-   **[About Web Quick Start](../concepts/WCM-intro-WQS.md)**  
Web Quick Start is a set of website design templates and sample architecture, built on the Alfresco Share content management and collaboration framework.
-   **[Installing Alfresco Content Services and Web Quick Start](../concepts/WQS-install-with-Alfresco.md)**  
If you are installing Alfresco Content Services and Web Quick Start for the first time, use the Alfresco Content Services setup wizard.
-   **[Manually installing Web Quick Start](../tasks/WQS-install-manual.md)**  
If you have an existing Alfresco Content Services installation and prefer to install Web Quick Start manually, you can apply the relevant AMP files to your application. This method is suitable for customized or integrated installations.
-   **[Creating the Web Quick Start site](../tasks/WQS-create-site.md)**  
The Web Quick Start site is a default Share Collaboration site with the sample Quick Start data imported. An Alfresco Share dashlet is provided, from which you can import the sample data.
-   **[Importing Web Quick Start demo data](../tasks/WQS-import-demodata.md)**  
When you initially add the Web Quick Start dashlet into the site dashboard, the dashlet displays a link that enables you to import the Web Quick Start demo data.
-   **[Configuring Web Quick Start](../tasks/WQS-config.md)**  
After you have imported the Web Quick Start website data, when you have refreshed Share, or the next time you log on, you can access the Web Quick Start site for configuration.
