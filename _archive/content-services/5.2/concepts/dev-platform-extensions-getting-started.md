# Getting Started

This information covers the use case of extending the Platform with extra functionality, such as deploying new content models and workflows.

The Platform provides a number of extension points where custom functionality can be plugged in and run embedded with the rest of the platform code. This is functionality that is not related to the Share user interface and that does not fit the remote integration use case.
