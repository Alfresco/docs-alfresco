# Access Control Lists

An Access Control List \(ACL\) is an ordered list of one or more Access Control Entries \(ACE\). An ACE associates a single authority to a single permission group or permission, and states whether the permission is to be allowed or denied. All nodes have an associated ACL.

There is one special, context-free, ACL defined in the XML configuration to support global permissions. An ACL specifies if it should inherit ACEs from a parent ACL. The parent ACL is associated with the primary parent node. When a new node is created it automatically inherits all ACEs defined on the parent within which it is created. Linking a node to a secondary parent has no effect on ACE inheritance; the node will continue to inherit permission changes from its primary parent \(defined when it was first created\).

By default, ACL inheritance is always from the primary parent. The underlying design and implementation does not mandate this. ACL inheritance does not have to follow the parent child relationship. It is possible to change this through the Java API.

There are several types of ACL defined in ACLType. The main types are:

-   DEFINING
-   SHARED
-   FIXED
-   GLOBAL

A node will be associated with an ACL. It will have a DEFINING ACL if any ACE has been set on the node. DEFINING ACLs include any ACEs inherited from the nodeâ€™s primary parent and above, if inheritance is enabled. All DEFINING ACLs are associated with one SHARED ACL. This SHARED ACL includes all the ACEs that are inherited from the DEFINING ACL. If the primary children of a node with a DEFINING ACL do not themselves have any specific ACEs defined then they can be assigned the related SHARED ACL. For the primary children of a node with a SHARED ACL that also have no specific ACEs set they can use the same SHARED ACL. A single SHARED ACL can be associated with many nodes. When a DEFINING ACL is updated, it will cascade update any related ACLs by using the ACL relationships rather than walk the node structure. If a DEFINING ACL inherits ACEs, then these will come from the SHARED ACL related to another DEFINING ACL.

ACLs and nodes have two linked tree structures.

FIXED ACLs are not associated with a node but found by name. A node ACL could be defined to inherit from a fixed ACL. A GLOBAL ACL is a special case of a FIXED ACL with a well known name. It will be used to hold the global ACE currently defined in XML.

ACEs comprise an authority, a permission, and a deny/allow flag. They are ordered in an ACL.

-   **[ACL ordering and evaluation](../concepts/secur-acl-ordereval.md)**  
The ACEs within an ACL are ordered and contain positional information reflecting how an ACE was inherited. DEFINING ACLs have entries at even positions; SHARED ACLs have entries at odd positions. For a DEFINING ACL, any ACEs defined for that ACL have position 0, any inherited from the parent ACL have position two, and so on. For a SHARED ACL, ACEs defined on the ACL from which it inherits will have position one.
-   **[An ACL example](../concepts/secur-acl-example.md)**  
This example relates a tree of nodes to two corresponding trees of ACLs. The nodes in the node tree are identified by number and are shown filled in black if they have any ACEs set, or white/clear if not. Primary child relationships are drawn as black lines and secondary child relationships as dashed lines. ACLs in the ACL trees are identified by letter, DEFINING ACLs are shown filled in black, and SHARED ACLs are shown as clear. Under each node on the node tree the related ACL is referenced.
