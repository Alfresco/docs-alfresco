# Using social features

In Alfresco you can use social features to like, favorite, and comment on files and folders.

These social features are available in the file preview screen, in the Site Content dashlet, and in several of the Document Library views. You can select to view just favorite files in several of your user and site dashlets.

-   Click ![Like icon](../images/like-icon.png) to like an file/folder. You can click it again to unlike it.
-   Click ![Favorite icon](../images/favorite-icon.png) to favorite an file/folder. You can click it again to unfavorite it.
-   Click ![Comment icon](../images/comment-icon.png) **Comment** to comment on an file/folder. When you've entered your comment click **Add**.

**Note:** You can't add comments if your permission level on the site is set to Consumer. Speak to your Alfresco administrator if you need to change your permission level.

-   **[Managing your comments](../concepts/library-comments.md)**  
Adding comments to content is a convenient way of giving feedback. You can edit and delete any comments that you added.
