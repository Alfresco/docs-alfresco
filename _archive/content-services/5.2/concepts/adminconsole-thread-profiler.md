# Thread Profiler

Use this tool to view the status and details of all threads.

All threads in the system are included in the profiler, with statuses of running, waiting, timed waiting, and blocked. The memory committed to each thread and its CPU time is also displayed. You can:

-   Click **Start Thread Profiler** to get current information on threads
-   Click on a thread to see its stack trace
-   Click on a column header to order thread details as required

**Note:** If a thread hasn't changed since the previous stack trace it displays the < symbol.
