# Searching for content

You can use the search box on the toolbar to search for files, sites, and people.

Type your search into the search box, and a list of matching files, sites, and people will be shown as you type.

If you're in a site you can click **Search all content** or **Search in \[sitename\]** to search all sites or just the site you're in. Private sites that you're not a member of, and their files, aren't shown.

There are lots of [search tips](search-examples.md) available, including:

-   Type \* to complete a word if you don't know the full word you're searching for. For example, both "*\*resco*" and "*alf\**" will show results for *alfresco*.
-   To search for items that contain only one of several words, use `OR` and surround your search with brackets, for example, *\(big OR red\)*. If you don't use brackets, search results are returned containing both *big* and *red*.

The five most relevant files, sites, and people are shown, but you can click **More** to see further results.

You can either:

-   Click on one of the results to go straight to it, or

-   Press Enter \(with the cursor in the search box\) to view all the [search results](search-results.md) for all files found by your search.


**Note:** Wiki pages and blog postings are shown under along with other files. Previews aren't shown for calendar events, site-related web links, discussion topics, or data lists and list items. You need to press Enter to search for them.
