# Using the Admin Console

The Admin Console application that gives you control over the management and settings of the Alfresco Content Services environment.

You'll find help text on the Admin Console pages to assist you with setting up the repository.

You can access the Admin Console directly from the [Alfresco Share Admin Tools](admintools.md) or open it as a standalone session, see [Launching the Admin Console](../tasks/adminconsole-open.md).

-   **[About the Admin Console](../concepts/adminconsole-about.md)**  
The Admin Console is a standalone console for managing the administration of the repository.
-   **[Launching the Admin Console](../tasks/adminconsole-open.md)**  
The Admin Console runs externally to the user interface and therefore you launch the application independently. This allows you to run the Admin Console without the need to run Alfresco Share.
-   **[Viewing the System Summary](../concepts/adminconsole-systemsummary.md)**  
System Summary in the Admin Console shows an overview of the status of the repository, including the general system information, subsystem status, clustering settings, the current authentication chain, and details of which AMPs are applied to the system.
-   **[Viewing Repository Information](../tasks/adminconsole-repoinfo.md)**  
Repository Information in the Admin Console shows details of the repository as it was originally installed. It also shows the current Alfresco Content Services version.
-   **[Customizing the Admin Console](../concepts/adminconsole-custom.md)**  
The Admin Console displays the most common administration activities. You can customize the Admin Console to show different options, properties, and layout, or you can create completely new pages.
