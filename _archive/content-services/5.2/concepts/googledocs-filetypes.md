# Google Docs supported document types

Google Docs restricts the formats of files or documents that can be uploaded or created.

The following table shows the file format restrictions for content that integrates with Google Docs.

|File type|Description|
|---------|-----------|
|DOC|A Microsoft Word 97-2003 document.|
|XLS|A Microsoft Excel 97-2003 Workbook.|
|PPT|A Microsoft PowerPoint 97-2003 Presentation.|
|DOCX|An XML-based Microsoft Word document.|
|XLSX|An XML-based Microsoft Excel Workbook.|
|PPTX|An XML-based Microsoft PowerPoint presentation.|

**Note:** You can edit the DOC, XLS, and PPT formats in Google Docs but when you save the content back to Alfresco Content Services, you must confirm that these formats will be converted to the equivalent Microsoft Office 2007 \(OOXML\) formats.

Google places further restrictions on the size and complexity of documents that can be edited in Google Docs. The **Edit in Google Docs** action is not available for documents or spreadsheets larger than 2 MB and presentations larger than 50 MB. Google also prevents editing of other documents that exceed their published limits. See the published [Google size limits](https://support.google.com/drive/answer/37603?hl=en).
