# Search results

If you press Enter in the Search box then all the files and folders found by your search are shown.

You can now:

-   Click on a result thumbnail to preview it.
-   Click on a result name to open it.

-   Click on one or more of the filter options to switch them on and off and narrow down the search results.

-   Hover over a result and click **Actions** and select an option from the menu.

-   Select multiple results and click **Selected Items** to select an action option.

    **Tip:** The main file actions are available here, but you may find more options available when you preview the file.

    You can delete a file this way but the search results won't be updated until you run a new search.


**Note:** Click the **Search in** menu to search in all sites or just in the site you're in.

If you're a [Search Manager](super-search-manager.md) super user then you'll have an additional **Search Manager** option you can click where you can create new search filters.

As well as the search box on the toolbar, there are also additional advanced search features for finding [people](../tasks/people-search.md), [sites](../tasks/sites-search.md), and [content](../tasks/search-advanced.md).

**Tip:** If a file is a Microsoft Office, PDF, or other text-based file type \(not an image or video\) then you can also click ![Advanced Search icon](../images/advanced-search-icon.png) on the file preview to search for text in the file.
