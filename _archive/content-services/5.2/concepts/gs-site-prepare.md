# Working with content

Before you begin working with content, we'll look at the two different concepts of content there are in Alfresco Share.

The first is content that is actually part of Alfresco Share features themselves, such as updates to a wiki, a new blog posts, or forum discussions.

The second is content items such as documents, spreadsheets, or images that are stored in the Document Library. These can be uploaded or created directly from Alfresco Share.

So now that you know the differences in content types, it's time to start adding content to your site.

-   **[Adding content](../tasks/gs-content-add.md)**  
First you'll look at adding content items such as documents, spreadsheets, presentations, and images to a site.
-   **[Editing content](../tasks/gs-content-update.md)**  
Updating your content in Alfresco Share is easy to do and you can even select whether to edit in Microsoft Office, offline, or in Google Docs.
-   **[Creating content](../tasks/gs-intro-create.md)**  
As well as uploading content, you can also create content right in Alfresco Share.
