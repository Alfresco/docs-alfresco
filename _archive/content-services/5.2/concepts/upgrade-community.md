# Upgrading from Alfresco Community Edition

Any GA \(General Availability\) release of Alfresco Community Edition can be upgraded to the latest version of Alfresco Content Services that includes the same Content Repository version family.

The following table shows the upgrade path for major versions:

|From Community|To Enterprise|
|--------------|-------------|
|Alfresco Community Edition 201602 GA|Alfresco One 5.1.0|
|Alfresco Community Edition 201701 GA|Alfresco Content Services 5.2.0|
|Alfresco Community Edition 201707 GA|Alfresco Content Services 5.2.2|

Please contact Alfresco Support for upgrade advice that's specific to your environment.

**Note:** When migrating from Community to Enterprise it is advisable to validate the Community source version to Enterprise target version that you're planning, and whether that path has been tested, or if an alternative path is advised. In some cases, the latest version of Community may supersede the current Enterprise version, and may require that you wait until the next Enterprise version of the service pack line is available.

You can then follow the upgrade path to Alfresco Content Services to upgrade to the most current release. See [Alfresco Content Services upgrade paths](upgrade-path.md) for more information.
