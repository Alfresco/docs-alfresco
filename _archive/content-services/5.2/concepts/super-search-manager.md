# Search Manager

With the Search Manager you can see details of existing search filters and create new filters.

**Note:** Search Manager is available to users in the `ALFRESCO_ADMINISTRATORS` and `ALFRESCO_SEARCH_ADMINISTRATORS` permissions groups.

The Search Manager is accessed from the search results screen. Just type a search in the search box and press Enter, then on the search results screen click **Search Manager**.

**Note:** Filtered search results can be bookmarked for quick and easy access.

All existing filters \(including default filters\) are shown along with their details, in the order that they are shown on the search results screen. You can change the order by using the ![](../images/arrows.png) buttons to move filters up or down the order.

Click **Create New Filter** to [create new search filters](../tasks/create-filter.md).

Most of the filter details are can be edited by hovering over them and clicking the ![Configure icon](../images/ico-configure.png) icon that displays.
