# Using the Alfresco Share Admin Tools

Share Admin Tools help you to manage your administration operations.

Administrators can use the Share Admin Tools to create and manage users and groups directly in Share, set application preferences, manage categories and tags, and browse the system information in the node browser.

**Note:** You can find additional admin tools in the [Repository Administration Console](at-adminconsole.md).

Admin Tools is visible on the toolbar if you are an Administrator or a user who is a member of the `ALFRESCO_ADMINISTRATORS` or `ALFRESCO_MODEL_ADMINISTRATORS` groups. If you are a member of `SITES_ADMINISTRATORS`, you'll have an additional Sites Manager option on the toolbar instead of Admin Tools.

-   **[About the Alfresco Share Admin Tools](../tasks/admintools-open.md)**  
You can see the **Admin Tools** option on the menu bar if you are an administrator user or a user who is a member of the `ALFRESCO_ADMINISTRATORS` group. Use the links to see more information about each tool.
