# Using the installers on Windows

Use this information to install Alfresco Content Services on Windows, using the Alfresco Content Services, Alfresco Content Services Platform, and Alfresco Share installers.

-   **[Installing on Windows using the Alfresco Content Services installer](../tasks/simpleinstall-enterprise-win.md)**  
The setup wizard for Microsoft Windows installs all the software and components that you require for running Alfresco Content Services. This setup wizard installs Alfresco Content Services and additional software, including a Tomcat application server, PostgreSQL database, JRE, and LibreOffice.
-   **[Installing on Windows using the Platform installer](../tasks/simpleinstall-enterprise-win-platform.md)**

It does not install Alfresco Share.
-   **[Installing on Windows using the Alfresco Share Installer](../tasks/simpleinstall-enterprise-win-share.md)**
