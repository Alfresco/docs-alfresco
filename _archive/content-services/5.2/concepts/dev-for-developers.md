# Developer guide

The Developer guide includes extensive guidance and reference materials to aid the developer in creating applications and extensions for Alfresco Content Services.

There are a number of approaches to developing for Alfresco Content Services depending on what you want to do. For example, if you are writing a client application, perhaps in Ruby or Python to connect to Alfresco Content Services then you would most likely use the Alfresco Content Services ReST API. If on the other hand you wanted to write a server-side extension in Java, you would use the Public Java API, or perhaps write a Web Script using Java, JavaScript and FreeMarker. Generally if you are creating extensions to Alfresco Content Services you would use the Alfresco SDK. This allows you to work in your IDE of choice, using technologies you already know, such as Java and Maven.

This Developer guide attempts to lay out the various options available to you, so you can use the right approach, depending on what you want to achieve.

You can read the material in this Developer guide sequentially, or the following table with give you some starting points if you want to dive in:

-   **[Alfresco Content Services architecture](../concepts/dev-arch-overview.md)**  
This gives a view of the architecture of Alfresco Content Services from the developer's perspective. At its core is a repository that provides a store for content, and a wide range of services that can be used by content applications to manipulate the content.
-   **[Alfresco Content Services SDK 3](../concepts/sdk-intro.md)**  
Alfresco Content Services SDK 3 is a Maven based development kit that provides an easy to use approach to developing applications and extensions for Alfresco. With this SDK you can develop, package, test, run, document and release your extension project.
-   **[API guide](../concepts/dev-api-intro.md)**  
Alfresco Content Services supports a range of APIs \(Application Programming Interfaces\) to enable developers to write applications that access the repository on-premise.
-   **[Extension packaging - modules](../concepts/dev-modules.md)**  
Extensions can be packaged as loadable modules. These modules are registered with Alfresco Content Services and can be viewed from the Admin Console or the Share Admin Tools.
-   **[Platform extensions](../concepts/dev-platform-extensions.md)**  
Platform Extensions are extensions to the Platform or Alfresco Content Services, and can be implemented through a variety of mechanisms. This information identifies the supported extension points and how you can leverage them to build your extensions to the Platform.
-   **[Platform integrations](../concepts/dev-platform-integrations.md)**  
Platform integrations are external additions to the Alfresco Content Services platform. These are generally clients that leverage the platform.
-   **[Share extensions](../concepts/dev-extensions-share.md)**  
This information looks at developing extensions for Alfresco Share. In particular, the creation of Share Extensibility Modules.
