# Using Alfresco Content Services from Microsoft Outlook

With Alfresco Outlook Integration you can use email and repository management without leaving Microsoft Outlook.

You can directly archive emails into Alfresco Share, use the full metadata support, full search, tagging and workflow capabilities, and attach files and view archived emails in your inbox.
