# Working with files and folders

Once files are added to a site, site members can access and work with them. In addition to adding more files, members can view, download, edit, and delete files.

-   **[Editing files](../concepts/library-item-edit-intro.md)**  
There are multiple ways to edit content. These options are available whenever suitable for a file type.
-   **[Downloading files](../tasks/library-item-download.md)**  
You can quickly download files from Alfresco Share so that you have a local copy.
-   **[Sharing files](../tasks/library-item-share.md)**  
You can easily share an file - even with people who don't have an Alfresco Share account. Clicking the **Share** action generates a URL that you can send by email or publish using social networking websites.
-   **[Applying aspects](../tasks/library-item-manage-aspects.md)**  
You can use aspects to add extra functionality, properties, or options to files. Alfresco Share provides you with a list of default aspects.
-   **[Managing file and folder permissions](../tasks/library-item-permissions.md)**  
You can override the default site permissions for any content you add to the document library. This lets you control what site members can see and do with your content.
-   **[Becoming content owner](../tasks/become-owner.md)**  
You can take ownership of files and folders from other users.
-   **[Changing the content type](../tasks/library-item-change-type.md)**  
 You can change an file's content type from its default to a more specific value.
