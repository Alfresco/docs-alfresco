There are a number of tools you will need to design, execute, and monitor your workflows. Some of these are included and some you can obtain separately.

The following diagram shows the tools used in designing, executing, and monitoring an Alfresco Content Services workflow:

-   **Activiti modeler**

    allows business and information analysts to model a BPMN 2.0 compliant business process in a web browser. This allows business processes to be shared, and no client software is needed before you can start modeling.

-   **Activiti designer**

    is an Eclipse plugin, which enables a developer to enhance the model of the business process into a BPMN 2.0 process that can be executed on the Activiti process engine. You can also run unit tests, add Java logic, and create deployment artifacts with the Activiti Designer.


-   **[The Workflow Console](../tasks/adminconsole-workflowconsole.md)**  
Use the Workflow Console in the Admin Console to manage Activiti workflows, including testing of newly developed workflows. You can also debug current in-flight workflows.
-   **[Enabling workflow process engines](../tasks/adminconsole-processengines.md)**  
Alfresco Content Services workflows run on an embedded Activiti workflow engine. Use Process Engines in the Admin Console to enable Activiti workflows and to edit properties.
-   **[The Activiti workflow console](../concepts/wf-activiti-workflow-console.md)**  
 The ActivitiWorkflow Console is a web based user interface that allows administration of workflow artifacts.
