# Thread Dump

Use this tool to generate and compare thread dumps to troubleshoot performance problems and deadlocks.

When you open the Thread Dump screen it displays a snapshot of all threads in currently running processes. You can:

-   **Get Another Thread Dump**

    Open a new tab displaying the latest thread dump, and then compare to identify the cause of any performance issues. You can open as many tabs as required.

-   **Save Current Thread**

    Download a text file with details of the currently displayed thread dump tab.

-   **Save All**

    Download a text file with details of all the thread dump tabs.
