# Importing and transferring files

Use this information to import files using the Bulk Import Tool, or transfer files using the File System Transfer Receiver \(FSTR\).

-   **[Using the Bulk Import tool](../concepts/Bulk-Import-Tool.md)**  
 The Bulk Import tool provides a mechanism for Systems Administrators to import existing content in bulk into a repository from the Alfresco server's file system.
-   **[Configuring the File System Transfer Receiver](../concepts/FSTR-intro.md)**  
The File System Transfer Receiver transfers folders and content from an Alfresco Content Services core repository \(the DM\) to configured targets using the Transfer Service, for example, a remote file system.
