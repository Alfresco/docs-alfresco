# Site features

As well as the Document Library and Site Members area, there are lots of features that can be included in a site.

Site managers can easily add and remove features by [customizing a site](../tasks/site-customize.md)

  

-   **[The calendar](../concepts/calendar-intro.md)**  
The site calendar lets you schedule and track events related to the current site.
-   **[The wiki](../concepts/wiki-intro.md)**  
The wiki lets site users create pages for a collaborative wiki.
-   **[The discussion forum](../concepts/discussions-intro.md)**  
The discussion forum lets you post user-generated content related to a site. These topics often take the form of questions or comments with threaded discussions.
-   **[The blog](../concepts/blog-intro.md)**  
The site blog lets you add commentary, descriptions of events, and other material related to your site.
-   **[Site links](../concepts/links-intro.md)**  
The links component lets site members compile a list of web links that are related to the site or that might be of interest to site users. These can be internal links pointing to site pages or external links pointing to any web address.
-   **[Data lists](../concepts/datalists-intro.md)**  
The data lists component lets site members create and manage lists of data relevant to the site. Users can work with their own lists and can also contribute to lists created by other site members.
