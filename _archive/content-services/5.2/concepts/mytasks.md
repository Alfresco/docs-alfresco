# Tasks and workflows

Tasks and workflows help you keep track of the things you and other users need to do. You can create a standalone task or workflow, or you can attach a file to it.

A workflow is a process that controls a specific task, such as a document review. Each task can be assigned to one or more people when a workflow is being created. Workflow creators can select to automatically send a notification email to users that are assigned a task as part of the workflow, but whether an email is sent or not the task will be visible in the users My Tasks dashlet.

Once all the task actions required by a workflow have been finished, the workflow will move from active to completed status. At this point you're free to delete the workflow.

Individual users manage their own tasks, and the person who created a workflow manages the workflow.

You can start workflows from a number of places:

-   Hover over a file in the library and click **More** then **Start Workflow**
-   Click **Tasks** on the toolbar, select any option, then click **Start Workflow**
-   Click **Start Workflow** on the My Tasks dashlet

  

-   **[Starting a workflow](../tasks/library-item-assign-workflow.md)**  
You can attach a workflow directly to one or more files. Starting a workflow generates a workflow task such as a review.
-   **[Viewing workflows you started](../tasks/more-menu-myworkflows-view.md)**  
You can view the full details of all workflows that you have started.
-   **[Cancelling an active workflow](../tasks/more-menu-myworkflows-cancel.md)**  
You can cancel an active workflow if you find you don't need it anymore. This deletes all tasks related to the workflow.
-   **[Deleting a completed workflow](../tasks/more-menu-myworkflows-delete.md)**  
Once you're finished with a workflow, you can delete it to clear it from the workflow list. This also deletes all tasks associated with the workflow.
-   **[Viewing tasks and workflows](../tasks/more-menu-mytasks-view.md)**  
You can view the details for an individual task or for the workflow that initiated a task.
-   **[Managing tasks](../tasks/more-menu-mytasks-edit.md)**  
Tasks assigned to you appear in two places: the My Tasks personal dashlet and the My Tasks page. Each task stays assigned to you until you complete or reassign it.
