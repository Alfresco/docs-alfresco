# Managing Audit Applications and Logs

This section walks through how to manage audit applications and their audit logs via the ReST API.

Audit logging is not enabled by default, but when it is enabled it is essential to be able to manage audit applications and their logs.

The ReST API supports listing audit applications, listing audit entries \(logs\), deleting audit entries etc.

If you are not familiar with audit logging in ACS, then have a look at this [page](audit-intro.md).
