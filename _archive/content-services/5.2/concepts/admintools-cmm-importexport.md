# Exporting/importing models

Model Manager provides a feature for exporting and importing models across different repositories.

You can export and import only those models which are created using the Model Manager.

Model Manager allows you to export layouts, custom types, aspects, and their associated properties for use in other repositories.

To export a model, follow the steps below:

1.  Click **Admin Tools**, and then click **Model Manager**.

    The **Model Manager** page is displayed.

2.  Click the **Actions** drop-down list for the model you want to export.

    This will save the model locally on your computer as a ZIP package.


**Importing a model**

You can import a model in Model Manager only as a ZIP package.

**Note:** You can't import models with the same name as the existing models in Model Manager. Model names must be unique.

To import a model, follow the steps below:

1.  Click **Admin Tools**, and then click **Model Manager**.

    The **Model Manager** page is displayed.

2.  Click the **Import Model** and select a ZIP file to import.
