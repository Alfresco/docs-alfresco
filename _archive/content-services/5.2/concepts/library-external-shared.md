# Shared Files

**Shared Files** is a unique area in Alfresco Share where you can create, store and share content, without adding it to a site Document Library.

Any content that you create or add to **Shared Files** is visible to all other users in your organization. It is in effect a shared drive, so you can quickly share content with colleagues without uploading it to a site, emailing it, or needing to find a pen drive.

You can access the **Shared Files** area from anywhere in Share by clicking **Shared Files** at the top of the screen.

The functionality available in the **Shared Files** area is identical to what you find in the Document Library, see [Working with content in a library](library-intro.md) for details.

**Parent topic:**[Working with files outside the library](../concepts/library-external.md)
