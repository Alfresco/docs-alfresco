# APIs

To access and extend out-of-the-box services, the content application server exposes two flavors of API, each designed for a specific type of client.

The two main categories of API are embedded and remote APIs.

-   **[Embedded APIs](../concepts/arch-api-embedded.md)**  
The Embedded API is used for developing extensions to the application server. Extensions deployed into the server often depend on existing services provided by the server. Therefore, developers of extensions use the Embedded API to gain access to those services.
-   **[Remote APIs](../concepts/arch-api-remote.md)**  
 The Remote API is primarily used to build ECM solutions against the content application server.
