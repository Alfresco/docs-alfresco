# Customizing applications

You can make basic configuration updates to customize Alfresco Content Services, or modify properties files to apply configuration changes.

-   [Updating system configuration parameters](configuration-overview.md): You can configure Alfresco Content Services for your specific environment requirements either by using the Admin Console, or by editing the alfresco-global.properties file, or by using a JMX client.
-   [Configuring Alfresco Share](share-configuring-intro.md): A number of options are available to customize Share. To configure Share, use the configuration file named share-config-custom.xml.
-   [Solr configuration](solr4-config-files.md): When you install Alfresco Content Services, several Solr-related configuration files are made available to you. To configure Solr, use the configuration file named solrcore.properties.

**Note:** Remember not to use the default user names, URLs, or passwords with different environment.

**Note:** You can customize or scale up to meet your login and security requirements. See [Setting up authentication and security](auth-intro.md) for more information.
