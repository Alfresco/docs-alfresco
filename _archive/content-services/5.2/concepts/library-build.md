# Adding content

You build up site content by creating an organized folder structure then adding content to it.

There are two ways to add content to Alfresco Share: create new content or upload existing content from your computer.

There are different options available depending on whether you're adding files or adding folders.

-   [Adding folders](library-add-folders.md)
-   [Adding files](library-add-content-intro.md)

-   **[Adding folders](../concepts/library-add-folders.md)**  
You can add folders from outside Alfresco Share and create new folders within a site.
-   **[Adding files](../concepts/library-add-content-intro.md)**  
You can add both existing files from outside Alfresco Share and create new files within a site.
