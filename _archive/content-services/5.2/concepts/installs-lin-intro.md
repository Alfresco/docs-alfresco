# Using the installers on Linux

Use this information to install Alfresco Content Services on Linux, using the Alfresco Content Services, Alfresco Content Services Platform, and Alfresco Share installers.

-   **[Installing on Linux using the Alfresco Content Services Installer](../tasks/simpleinstall-enterprise-lin.md)**  
The setup wizard for Linux installs all the software and components that you require for running Alfresco Content Services. This setup wizard installs Alfresco Content Services and additional software, including a Tomcat application server, PostgreSQL database, JRE, and LibreOffice.
-   **[Installing on Linux using the Platform Installer](../tasks/simpleinstall-enterprise-lin-platform.md)**  
The Alfresco Content Services Platform Installer for Linux installs the repository and all the software and components that you require for running the Alfresco Content Services platform; for example, a Tomcat application server, PostgreSQL database, JRE, LibreOffice, Solr 4 and other required software like ImageMagick. It does not install Alfresco Share.
-   **[Installing on Linux using the Alfresco Share Installer](../tasks/simpleinstall-enterprise-lin-share.md)**  
The Alfresco Share Installer for Linux installs only Alfresco Share, with its own Tomcat application server and the Share Services AMP.
