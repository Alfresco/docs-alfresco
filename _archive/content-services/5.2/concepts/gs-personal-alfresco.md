# Personalizing Alfresco Share

Having installed Alfresco Share and signed in, the first thing you can do is to personalize Alfresco Share to your own tastes and needs.

You're going to update your dashboard and your profile.

Your dashboard is made up of dashlets - each dashlet displays summary information on different parts of Alfresco Share, such as your latest updates, your tasks, or your sites. There are two different sets of dashlets available - one set for your personal Alfresco Share dashboard and one set that is used to customize individual sites that you set up.

As well as adding and removing dashlets you can also customize your dashboard layout.

Managing your profile means that you can create a personality that's visible to other Alfresco Share users.

You can customize your dashboard so that you only see the information that you're interested in.
-   **[Updating your profile](../tasks/gs-publish-credentials.md)**  
Alfresco Share user profiles help you to identify who a user is and what they do in your organization.
