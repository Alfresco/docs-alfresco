# Installing and configuring software

Use this information to install and configure the software on which the SDK depends.

You'll need to download and install the following tools and libraries, if you don't already have them:

1.  The Oracle Java Software Development Kit \(JDK\) version 8
2.  Apache Maven 3.2.5+
3.  Spring Loaded \(**Note**. only works with the [Share AMP archetype](alfresco-sdk-archetypes-share-amp.md) at the moment\).
