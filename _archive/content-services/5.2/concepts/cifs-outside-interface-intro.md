# Using the Windows Explorer shortcuts

You can work with files without actually being in the Alfresco Share interface.

Your administrator can map the repository so that you can access your content using Windows Explorer or a desktop shortcut. If you are working in this way, then there will be up to three additional files shown on each level of the Alfresco Content Services file structure:

-   \_\_CheckInOut.exe
-   \_\_ShowDetails.exe
-   \_\_Share.url

**Note:** The Share.url is only available within site folders, rather than everywhere in the repository.

You can use these files to add content to the repository, check documents in and out, view document details, and open Alfresco Share in a browser window.

**Note:** These options only function when you are working in a Windows environment.

-   **[Add a file from outside Alfresco Share](../tasks/cifs-add-file-outside-alfresco.md)**  
 You can easily drag and drop content to the repository from outside Share.
-   **[Check out files from outside Alfresco Share](../tasks/cifs-using-checkinout-exe.md)**  
 You can use the CheckInOut.exe to check content out so that you can work on it securely.
-   **[View item details from a mapped drive](../tasks/cifs-usingshowdetails-exe.md)**  
 You can use the ShowDetails.exe to view item details and properties.
-   **[Open Alfresco Share in a browser window](../tasks/cifs-using-share-exe.md)**  
 You can use the Share.url to open the Share in a browser window.
