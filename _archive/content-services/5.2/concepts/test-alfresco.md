# Test and familiarize after configuring

You have successfully installed and configured Alfresco Share. This information will help you check that the features and customizations you have added are operational.

Tips to help you test your customizations:

**Note:** We recommend that you create one or two test sites for testing purposes and put all your test data in those sites. After finishing the tests, you can delete the test sites in order to clear your database.

-   If you have installed Alfresco Records Management, test whether you can use it to search records in the repository. See [Using Records Management](https://docs.alfresco.com/rm2.5/concepts/rm-intro.html).
-   If you have installed and configured the Kofax Release script, test whether you can you use it to capture and publish content. See [Installing and configuring the Kofax Release script](kofax-intro.md).
