# JMX bean categories reference

This information explains the individual bean types exported by Alfresco Content Services. The heading for each bean type provides the JMX object naming scheme, where possible. Each section lists the individual properties for the bean type.

-   **[JMX read-only monitoring beans](../concepts/jmx-readonly-beans.md)**  
JMX values \(Managed Bean or MBean attributes\) are exposed in the Admin Console and with internal tools \(JMX Dump\) or external tools like JConsole. The read-only beans are described here with example values.
-   **[JMX editable management beans](../concepts/jmx-editman-beans.md)**  
JMX values \(Managed Bean or MBean attributes\) are exposed in the Admin Console and with internal tools \(Alfresco JMX Dump\) or external tools like JConsole. The editable management beans are described here with their default values where attributes are not already explained in the Admin Console.
-   **[Attribute and metadata field mapping for file types](../references/metadata-extraction-mapping.md)**  
Use this information to understand the default mapping in Alfresco Content Services between file types, metadata extractors, and mapped attributes.
