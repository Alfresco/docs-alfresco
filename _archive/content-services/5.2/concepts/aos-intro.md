# Installing and configuring Alfresco Office Services

Alfresco Office Services \(AOS\) allow you to access Alfresco Content Services directly from all your Microsoft Office applications.

Installing Alfresco Office Services allows Microsoft Office Suite applications \(for example, Word, PowerPoint, and Excel\) to interact with Alfresco Content Services similar to SharePoint. This feature allows you to edit Office documents in Alfresco Share and to modify Office files without checking them in and out. Share locks the file while it is being modified and releases the lock when the file is saved and closed.

AOS replaces and enhances the Microsoft SharePoint Protocol Support that was available in previous versions of Alfresco Content Services.

See [Alfresco Office Services](http://docs.alfresco.com/aos1.1/concepts/aos-intro.html) for more information.
