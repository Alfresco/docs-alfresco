# Enable auditing and Alfresco Access audit application

Enable auditing in Alfresco repo and enable the out-of-the-box preconfigured "Alfresco Access" Audit Application.

This section has a lot of examples where the "Alfresco Access" audit application has been enabled. So in order to get a better feeling for how the Audit ReST API works, it make sense to enable this audit application before moving on with the examples in this section.

This [page](audit-enable.md) has all the info you need to enable this audit application.
