# Configuring an optional patch for upgrade

Transactional metadata query requires two optional patches to be applied for full support. If no patch is applied there is no database support.

The first patch does not support boolean, float or double properties, and disjunction \(OR\). It adds the database support for TMDQ equivalent to an out-of-the-box Alfresco One 5.0 install \(where float, double, boolean, and disjunctions are not supported\).

The second patch adds the database support for TMDQ equivalent to an out-of-the-box Alfresco One 5.1 install. Some CMIS QL use cases where `OR` would be used are supported by using `IN`. In Alfresco One 5.1 and later versions, these restrictions go away after applying all TMDQ optional patches. The database size will be approximately 25% larger with all indexes applied.

To use or run a query against the `float`, `double`, or `boolean` property data types, you need to run an optional patch that adds the required indexes to the database. To do so, set the following property in the alfresco-global.properties file:

```
system.metadata-query-indexes-more.ignored=false 
```

When using all other data types \(such as `string`, `integer`, `id`, or `datetime`\), to enable the patch that adds the required indexes to the database, set the following property in the alfresco-global.properties file:

```
system.metadata-query-indexes.ignored=false 
```

If these optional patches are not run, the metadata query will not be used, regardless of the configuration. This configuration is checked when the subsystem is reloaded.

For a new install, the default behavior is to use the `TRANSACTIONAL_IF_POSSIBLE` metadata queries. For an upgraded system, the `TRANSACTIONAL_IF_POSSIBLE` metadata queries will be used only if the upgrade patches have been run.
