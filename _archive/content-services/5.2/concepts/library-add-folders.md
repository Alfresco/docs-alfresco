# Adding folders

You can add folders from outside Alfresco Share and create new folders within a site.

There are three ways to add folders:

-   Click Create in the Document Library - see [Creating folders](../tasks/library-folder-template.md)
-   Drag and drop folders from your computer - see [Drag and drop folders](../tasks/library-folder-dragdrop.md)
-   Create folders from templates - see [Creating folders from a template](../tasks/library-folder-template.md)

-   **[Creating folders](../tasks/library-create-folder.md)**  
The **Library** section of the explorer panel shows the folder structure for the current site. A new site contains just one folder named Documents. Add new folders here.
-   **[Drag and drop folders](../tasks/library-folder-dragdrop.md)**  
You can drag and drop folders straight from your computer into Alfresco Share.
-   **[Creating folders from a template](../tasks/library-folder-template.md)**  
As well as creating folders from scratch, you can also create folders from templates.
