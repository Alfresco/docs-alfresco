# Java API

When you need to create new services in Alfresco Content Services, or develop applications or customizations that cannot be implemented at the web script level, it is necessary to write those extensions in Java. Alfresco Content Services provides Java-level APIs, which are documented through the JavaDoc system.

See the JavaDoc documentation on the [Alfresco Developer Site](http://dev.alfresco.com/resource/docs/java/index.html?overview-summary.html). It is possible to access the complete range of Java APIs, but there is a list of recommended Public Java API calls below. Where possible it is strongly recommended that your application limits itself to this list, so that your application works on future versions of Alfresco Content Services.

-   **[Public Java API services](../concepts/dev-services.md)**  
The Public Java API provides access to Alfresco Content Services through a number of services that are exposed. These services are accessed via a single point of access - the Service Registry. This information provides an overview of the services exposed by the Public Java API.
