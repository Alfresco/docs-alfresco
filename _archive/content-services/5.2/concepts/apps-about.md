# Alfresco Share client application

The Alfresco Content Services client application provide a means of accessing the repository. Alfresco Content Services provides Alfresco Share which is a web-based client application, providing an interface that allows the user to create, upload, and manage content.

The user interface is built entirely with the Alfresco web script technology, which can be used to extend the application. Share provides content management capabilities with simple user interfaces, tools to search and browse the repository, content such as thumbnails and associated metadata, renditions of content, and a set of collaboration tools such as wikis, discussions, and blogs. Alfresco Share is organized as a set of sites that can be used as a meeting place for collaboration. Alfresco Share is a web-based application that can be run on a different server to the server that runs the repository, providing opportunities to increase scale and performance.
