# Configuring email

Use this information to configure email services, including inbound and outbound email, subscriptions, and email clients.

-   **[Configuring inbound and outbound email](../concepts/email-intro.md)**  
The email subsystem allows you to configure the outbound and inbound SMTP email settings to interact with Alfresco Content Services.
-   **[Configuring the Activities Feed](../tasks/adminconsole-activitiesfeed.md)**  
Activities Feed emails are sent from Alfresco Content Services to all users, summarizing the activities they see in their My Activities dashlet. Users will not see these email unless the Activities Feed is enabled. Emails include activities in all sites they are a member of, and by people they are following. In the Admin Console, you can set the frequency with which these emails are sent, the maximum number of activities they contain, and the maximum age of the activities.
-   **[Enabling the Subscription Service](../tasks/adminconsole-subscriptionservice.md)**  
Subscriptions in the Admin Console allows you to enable or disable the Follow feature for users to follow each other in Alfresco Share. Users can keep track of other users activities by choosing to follow them.
-   **[Configuring the email client with IMAP](../concepts/imap-intro.md)**  
IMAP protocol support allows email applications that support IMAP \(including Outlook, Apple Mail, Thunderbird, and so on\) to connect to and interact with Alfresco Content Services repositories.
