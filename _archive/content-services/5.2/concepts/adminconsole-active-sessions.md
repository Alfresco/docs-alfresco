# Active Sessions

Use this tool to check database pool usage and current sessions for active users.

The monitoring and management extensions can be subdivided into three categories:

-   **Database Connection**

    Displays the number of active and idle connections with the database.

-   **Active Sessions / Users**

    Displays the number of active sessions and the number of active users.

-   **Logged in users**

    View all users who are currently logged in. Click **Log Out User** to log users out of the repository.

    **Note:** Clients such as Alfresco Share will automatically log a user back into the repository if the client has cached valid authentication details.
