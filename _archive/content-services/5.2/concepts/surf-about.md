# Web tier and Surf

Alfresco Content Services provides ECM capabilities as data services, user interfaces, and user applications. The user interface capabilities are provided by applications and application components using Alfresco Content Services web tier, Surf, originally developed as a faster way to develop content applications using scripting and REST architecture.

Development of web scripts allows for the creation of a REST-based API. Web scripts can be executed without compilation, and provide a quick and easy way to extend and enhance Alfresco Content Services standard services.

The web script infrastructure accommodates Java beans as easily as JavaScript. Web scripts add little overhead but provide a great deal of flexibility and development productivity. Web scripts in the web tier let you quickly build user interface components with Surf or simple HTML and deploy them as Alfresco Share components, portlets, or other web platforms such as Google Gadgets.
