# Authenticating with the Repository

Before you can use the Alfresco ReST API you need to authenticate with the server to get a ticket.

## Introduction

Before you can call any of the API endpoints, except a few ones that doesn't require authentication, you need to authenticate with the Repository so your operations are executed on behalf of a specific user. When you authenticate successfully a ticket is returned that can be used in subsequent calls to the API. A ticket is valid for a specific time, so if you don't make any calls for a while, then you might get 401 errors back, which means you need to authenticate again to get a new ticket.

## Authenticating to get a ticket

To authenticate with the Repository the following URL is used, and it is part of the Authentication API:

**http://localhost:8080/alfresco/api/-default-/public/authentication/versions/1/tickets**

When calling this URL a HTTP POST should be used with the username and password as data:

```
$ curl --header "Content-Type: application/json" --request POST --data '{"userId":"admin","password":"admin"}' http://localhost:8080/alfresco/api/-default-/public/authentication/versions/1/tickets
{"entry":
  {"id":  "TICKET_08eb7e2e2c17964ca51f0f33186cc2fc9d56d593",
   "userId":"admin"
  }
}
```

Here Iâ€™m logging in as **admin** with password **admin**, which is common for local developer/test installations of ACS. But you can use any other username/password combination that represents a user in the Alfresco User database, being it local or linked to LDAP. However, it's good to use the **admin** user when you are playing around with the ReST API as you will almost always get a response back as you have full access. You don't have to worry about the user having the correct permissions to execute the call, having access to the content, etc. A ticket is return inside a JSON object.

We can make the POST call a bit shorter as `-H` is short for `--header` and `-d` for `--data`. The `-request POST` part is optional if you use `-d`, as the `-d` flag implies a POST request. So the call can also be executed as follows:

```
$ curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"userId":"admin","password":"admin"}' http://localhost:8080/alfresco/api/-default-/public/authentication/versions/1/tickets | jq
{  
  "entry": {    
    "id": "TICKET_08eb7e2e2c17964ca51f0f33186cc2fc9d56d593",    
    "userId": "admin"  
  }
}
```

You get the same ticket back if you call the API multiple times.

*Windows users*:

Single quotes around JSON does not work on Windows, use double quotes instead:

```
curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d "{\"userId\":\"admin\",\"password\":\"admin\"}" http://localhost:8080/alfresco/api/-default-/public/authentication/versions/1/tickets
```

## Base64 encoding the ticket

When we have the ticket we need to base64 encode it before we can use it in subsequent calls:

*On Mac and Linux*:

```
$ echo -n 'TICKET_08eb7e2e2c17964ca51f0f33186cc2fc9d56d593' | openssl base64
VElDS0VUXzA4ZWI3ZTJlMmMxNzk2NGNhNTFmMGYzMzE4NmNjMmZjOWQ1NmQ1OTM=
```

*On Windows*:

```
powershell "[convert]::ToBase64String([Text.Encoding]::UTF8.GetBytes(\"TICKET_08eb7e2e2c17964ca51f0f33186cc2fc9d56d593\"))"
```

## Using the ticket

Now when we got a base64 encoded ticket, such as `VElDS0VUXzA4ZWI3ZTJlMmMxNzk2NGNhNTFmMGYzMzE4NmNjMmZjOWQ1NmQ1OTM=`, we can start using it in an API call. The way we use the ticket in a Curl call is to add it with the `Authorization` header as follows:

```
curl -X GET -H 'Accept: application/json' -H 'Authorization: Basic {ticket}' '{API endpoint URL}' | jq
```

With an example ticket and an example API endpoint it will look like this:

```
curl -X GET -H 'Accept: application/json' -H 'Authorization: Basic VElDS0VUXzA4ZWI3ZTJlMmMxNzk2NGNhNTFmMGYzMzE4NmNjMmZjOWQ1NmQ1OTM=' 'http://localhost:8080/alfresco/api/discovery' | jq
```

This ReST API Guide contains hundreds of examples of how to use a ticket with GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE calls.
