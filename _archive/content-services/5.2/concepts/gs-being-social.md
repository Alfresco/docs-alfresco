# Being social

You have built a site and added some content to it. The next thing you need to do is to get other users on your site, sharing and creating their own content.

In Alfresco Share you can schedule social events using the shared site calendar, and add both internal and external users to the site. You also decide how much power they have in the site, such as whether they can just add content or actively edit content created by other users. There is also a full range of social features such as liking content and following favorite users.

-   **[Scheduling events](../tasks/gs-webinar-schedule.md)**  
Having previously added a calendar to your site, you can now use it to schedule events for your team.
-   **[Adding users to your site](../tasks/gs-members-invite.md)**  
Now that you've created a site and added content, the next step is to invite other Alfresco Share users to the site.
-   **[Using social features](../tasks/gs-engage-content.md)**  
When you look at the site dashboard you can see site activity and details of content that has been added or edited.
-   **[Following users](../tasks/gs-engage-users.md)**  
There can be many users of a system, so it is likely that there will be some users whose activities will be of more importance to you. You can choose to follow these users so that you can easily keep track of what they've been doing.
