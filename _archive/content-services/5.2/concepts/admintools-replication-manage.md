# Managing existing jobs

The Replication Jobs page in **Admin Tools** displays a list of all existing replication jobs.

For each job in this list, you can perform any of the following actions to manage and maintain the jobs:

-   Run a job
-   Cancel a job
-   Edit a job
-   Delete a job

-   **[Running a replication job](../tasks/admintools-replication-run.md)**  
The **Run Job** tool allows you to run a replication job. You can do this at any time. If a schedule is set for the job, it remains in place and will be run at the appropriate time.
-   **[Canceling a replication job](../tasks/admintools-replication-cancel.md)**  
You can cancel a job that is currently running, regardless of whether it was started automatically \(that is, it is a scheduled job\) or manually.
-   **[Editing a replication job](../tasks/admintools-replication-edit.md)**  
You can easily update existing replication jobs. In addition to changing the job details, you can use this feature to disable a job so that it will not be run.
-   **[Deleting a replication job](../tasks/admintools-replication-delete.md)**  
If you no longer need a replication job, you can delete it from the Jobs list. If there is a chance you might need the job again, you might prefer to edit the job and simply disable it.
