# Scheduled Jobs

Use this tool to view all the currently scheduled jobs on your system.

You have the option to click **Run** to manually run individual scheduled jobs to ensure they're functioning correctly. See [Scheduled Jobs](../references/dev-extension-points-scheduled-jobs.md) for more details.

**Note:** Be careful when running a job manually. Triggering a Lucene backup for example may cause a system outage for a few minutes.
