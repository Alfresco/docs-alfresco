# More resources

This is the end of the Alfresco Share Getting Started guide, and you should now be able to use Alfresco Share in ways that will improve how you work on a day to day basis.

In this tutorial you've learnt how to:

-   Customize your own dashboard and user profile
-   Create a site where your team can share content and collaborate
-   Work with different kinds of content and add it to your site
-   Add users to your site, set up meetings, and use social media-style features
-   View and understand site activities

This is just the beginnings of what you can achieve with Alfresco Share; we'd really recommend that you take some time to look at our other learning resources and try out other features that will help you to do great work:

-   Read the [\(Using Alfresco Share\)](master-using-intro.md) documentation on other features
-   Watch the Alfresco Share 'How To' videos [\('How To' videos\)](../topics/alfresco-video-tutorials.md)
-   Use other site components such as discussion forums[\(Discussion forums\)](discussions-intro.md), blogs[\(Blogs\)](blog-intro.md), and data lists [\(Data lists\)](datalists-intro.md)
