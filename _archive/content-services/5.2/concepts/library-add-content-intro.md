# Adding files

You can add both existing files from outside Alfresco Share and create new files within a site.

Use the **Upload** option to upload existing files from your computer into the library.

You can also drag and drop one or more files to the library view - even to a particular folder.

**Tip:** In **Detailed View** you can drag and drop files into the current library level or directly onto a folder. An arrow will be displayed when the files are correctly positioned over the folder to be dropped. In all other views you can drop files into the current library level only. So if you want to drop them into a specific folder, that folder needs to be open in the library view.

The **Create** menu provides options for creating different kinds of content directly in the library: plain text, HTML, and XML documents, as well as three types of Google Docs content \(documents, spreadsheets, presentations\). You can also create content from a template.

-   **[Uploading files](../tasks/library-add-content.md)**  
Adding files from your computer to Alfresco Share is simple. You can upload a single file or several files at a time.
-   **[Creating files](../tasks/library-create-content.md)**  
With the **Create** feature you can create plain text, HTML, and XML files directly in Alfresco Share.
-   **[Creating Google Docs files](../tasks/library-create-content-googledocs.md)**  
You can easily create Google Docs documents, spreadsheets, and presentations from Alfresco Share.
-   **[Creating files from a template](../tasks/library-create-template.md)**  
As well as creating files from scratch, you can also create files from templates.
