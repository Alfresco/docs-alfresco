# Managing People and Groups

This section walks through how to manage people and groups via the ReST API.

Being able to manage people and groups remotely is useful in different test scenarios, development environments and, for example, when group permissions should be set up on folders.

However, it should be noted that in a production environment Alfresco is usually connected to an LDAP system and users \(people\) and groups are then synchronized \(imported\) from the LDAP system, including group memberships.
