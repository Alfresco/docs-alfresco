# Solr backup and restore

Use this information to backup and restore the Solr server.

Your backup strategy must be tested end-to-end, including restoration of backups that were taken previously. Ensure that you have adequately tested your backup scripts prior to deploying Alfresco Content Services to production.

-   **[Restoring Solr indexes](../tasks/solr-recovery.md)**  
Follow these steps to restore the Solr indexes.
