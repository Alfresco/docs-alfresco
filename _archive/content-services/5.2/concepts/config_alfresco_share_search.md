# Configuring search in Alfresco Share

The following sections describe how to configure search in Alfresco Share.

-   **[Controlling permissions checking on search results](../tasks/search_permissions_check.md)**  
You can limit time that Alfresco Content Services spends on ensuring that the user executing the search has the necessary permissions to see each result. Setting this limit increases search speed and reduces the use of resources.
-   **[Controlling search results](../tasks/controlling_search_results.md)**  
Use this information to controlling the maximum number of items that an Alfresco Share search returns.

**Parent topic:**[Transactional metadata query](../concepts/intrans-metadata.md)
