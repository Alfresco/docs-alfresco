# Setting up clustering

You can implement multiple Alfresco Content Services instances in a clustered environment.

A cluster represents a collection of nodes. Clustering is implemented to provide high scalability and resilience. Improved performance is enhanced through redundant nodes that provide services when other nodes fail. When integrated with a load balancer, performance is enhanced by distributing, or balancing, server workload across a collection of nodes.
