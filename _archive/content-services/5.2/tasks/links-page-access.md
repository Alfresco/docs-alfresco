# Accessing the site links

Access the site links component to view the web links compiled for the current site.

In this component you can create new links, as well as edit and delete the links that you created. You can add a comment to any link listed.

1.  In a site click **More** then **Links**.

    **Note:** In each site the feature names can be customized. If the site manager has done this, the link might have a name other than **Links**.

    This opens the component. The main view defaults to the **All Links** view so you are seeing a list of all web links created for the site. The summary includes:

    -   the link title
    -   the link URL
    -   the date and time the link was created
    -   the user who created the link
    -   a description of the link
    -   the tags associated with the link
2.  Use the **<<** and **\>\>** navigation buttons to move forward and backward through multiple pages of links.

3.  Click **Simple View** to display only the basic link details: title and URL.

    Click **Detailed View** to display the summary view.
