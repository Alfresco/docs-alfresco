# Becoming content owner

You can take ownership of files and folders from other users.

You may need to do this if someone who owned a file or folder has left your company and you need to take responsibility for it.

**Note:** You need to be a Site Manager or have permission to delete a file or folder to become its owner, see [User roles and permissions](../references/permissions_share.md).

1.  Click on a file to open the file preview.

    **Tip:** If you're taking ownership of a folder you need to hover over it then select **View Details**.

2.  Click **Become Owner** and select **OK**.

    You now have full ownership rights of the file / folder.
