# Selecting multiple list items

There are two methods to select multiple list items in the current data list. You can select any number of items.

1.  In a data list select list items in one of the following ways:

    -   Click a check box to select the associated list item.
    -   Click **Select** at the top of the data list and click **All**.
    Click **None** to clear the list selections. Click **Invert Selection** to toggle the check boxes to their opposite state.


The appropriate check boxes appear selected in the data list.
