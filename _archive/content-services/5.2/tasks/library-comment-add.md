# Adding a comment

You can add comments to folders and individual files to give other users information or notes.

You can comment on both files and folders. This feature is available in a file preview screen, in the Site Content dashlet, and in several of the Document Library views.

**Note:** You can't add comments if your permission level on the site is set to Consumer. Speak to your administrator if you need to change your permission level.

1.  Find the content \(file or folder\) you want to comment on.

2.  Click **Comment**.

    The comment box on the file preview screen opens.

3.  Enter your comment.

    The text box includes features to format the text; insert bulleted and numbered lists; change the font color; and help with editing.

4.  Click **Add Comment**.

    Your comment appears at the top of the list. You have the option to edit comments you've made, and site managers can edit any comments.
