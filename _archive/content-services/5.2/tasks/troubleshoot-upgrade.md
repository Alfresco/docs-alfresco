# Troubleshooting an upgrade

Use these tips for diagnosing and resolving any issues that might arise as a result of an upgrade.

1.  Immediately after starting the server, make a copy of the alfresco.log file.

2.  In the alfresco.log file, note the locations of the temporary files containing the SQL statements executed during the upgrade, and make a copy of these temporary files.

3.  Submit the log file and temporary files to Alfresco Support.
