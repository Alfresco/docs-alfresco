# Reordering the rules in the rule set

As part of managing your rule set you can pick the order in which the rules are run. If your folder has inherited rules, those are always run first in the order they're listed. Any rules marked as inactive are simply skipped.

1.  Hover over a folder with rules applied \(indicated by the ![](../images/rules-icon.png) icon\) and click **More** then **Manage Rules**.

2.  On the left side of the page drag and drop rules to where you want them in the list.

    **Note:** You can't reorder linked or inherited rules here; that has to be done in the folder where they were created. Click **Reset** to return the rule set to its last saved order.

3.  Click **Save**.
