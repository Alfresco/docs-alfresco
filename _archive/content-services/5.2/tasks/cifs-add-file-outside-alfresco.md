# Add a file from outside Alfresco Share

You can easily drag and drop content to the repository from outside Share.

**Note:** This functionality is available in a Windows environment if the Alfresco Content Services repository has been mapped by your administrator, so that you can access it from Windows Explorer.

1.  Select a file in Windows Explorer or your desktop.

2.  Drag the file onto the location in the repository that you want to add it to.

    The file is added to the selected location in the repository.
