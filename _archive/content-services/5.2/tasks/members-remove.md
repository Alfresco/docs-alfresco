# Removing a site member or site group

When you remove members or groups from a site they can no longer access it, but if the site is public they can rejoin it.

**Note:** Only a site manager can remove members from a site.

1.  In a site clickÂ **Site Members**, or **More** then **Site Members** if the site has additional features.

2.  Select **Users** or **Groups**.

3.  Search for the site member or group you want to remove.

    Type a full or partial name, or leave the search box empty to display all members or groups.

4.  Click **Remove**.
