# Choosing a site homepage

Site dashboards are the default homepage on all Alfresco Share sites.

Site managers have the option to remove the site dashboard for individual sites. Whichever page comes first in the Current Site Pages will then become the default homepage for the site. You can also keep the dashboard, but reorder the pages to that a different page is the homepage.

1.  Enter a site.

2.  Click ![](../images/settings-icon.png) then **Customize Site**.

    The Site Dashboard is shown by default as one of your Current Site Pages.

3.  Click **Remove** to remove it from the site.

    Alternatively, change the order of the Current Site Pages so that a different page comes first \(from left to right\). This page will become the site homepage.

4.  Click **OK** to save your changes.


The site displays with it's new homepage.

You can always add the site dashboard back later.
