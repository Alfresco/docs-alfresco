# Browsing the site links

The explorer panel on the main view enables you to filter the links for easier navigation.

The explorer panel on the left side of the page lets you display a subset of the links by selecting a specific view or a tag.

The **Links** list in the browsing pane provides the following options for browsing links:

-   **All Links**

    Displays all links

-   **My Links**

    Displays the links created by the current user

-   **Recently Added**

    Displays the links created in the past seven days


The **Tags** list displays all tags currently associated with one or more links.

**To browse the links:**

1.  In the Links feature select an option in the explorer panel:

    1.  In the **Links** list click a view to display the links in the current site that correspond to that selection.

    2.  In the **Tags** list click the tag you're interested in to display all links in the current site associated with that tag.

2.  Click **Simple View** to display only the basic link details: title and URL.

    Click **Detailed View** to display the summary view.
