# Adding groups to a site

Inviting users one at a time to join your site can be time consuming. To save time you can add entire user groups.

1.  Click ![Invite to Site](../images/invite-to-site-icon.png) in the site you want to add groups to, or click **Add Users** in the Site Members dashlet.

    **Tip:** You can open the Add Users page directly from the Site Members page.

    **Important:** You must be a site manager to add groups.

2.  Click **Groups** and then click **Add Groups**.

3.  Enter a search term such as a group name and click **Search**.

    **Tip:** You need to enter at least one character. The search is not case sensitive.

4.  Click **Add** for each group you want to add.

5.  Set the site role for each group, or use **Set all roles to** to assign the same role to all groups. This controls what the groups users can do in the site.

    **Tip:** See [User roles and permissions](../references/permissions_share.md) for more about site roles.

    Once you've selected site roles for all the groups you've selected, the **Add Groups** button will be switched on.

6.  Click **Add Groups** to add the groups listed.

    A message displays showing the number of groups you've added. All these groups can now use the site. You can continue to add more groups as required.

    **Note:** You can click **back to Site Groups** to return to the Search for Site Groups page without adding any groups.
