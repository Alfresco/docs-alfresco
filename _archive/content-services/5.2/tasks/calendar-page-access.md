# Accessing the calendar

Access the calendar to view upcoming events for the current site.

Within the calendar you can create events, as well as edit and delete any events that you created.

1.  In a site click **More** then **Calendar**.

    **Note:** In each site the feature names can be customized. If the site manager has done this, the link might have a name other than **Calendar**.

    This opens the calendar which defaults to the Month view. Any events scheduled in the current month are displayed on the calendar.
