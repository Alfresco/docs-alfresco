# Editing files in Microsoft Office

You can edit Microsoft Office files directly from Alfresco Share. When you're editing a file it's locked in Share until you finish editing it.

**Important:** If you're working on a Mac then make sure you've updated to the latest minor version number of Microsoft Office. If you have an older version installed then you might have problems opening documents.

1.  Hover over a file and click **More** then **Edit in Microsoft Office**.

    A message asks you to make sure you can trust the content.

    The file opens in a separate window. In Share the file will be shown as locked.

    **Note:** You might get a further request to enter your Share login details and **Enable Editing**.

2.  You can now edit the file.

    The minor version number in Share is updated each time you save the file. All standard Microsoft Office functionality is available.

3.  When you're done, save and close the file.


If **Edit in Microsoft Office** isn't available then check that:

-   You have the site permission to edit the file. Consumers can only view a file.
-   You're using [Supported Platforms](../concepts/supported-platforms-ACS.md)

**Parent topic:**[Editing files](../concepts/library-item-edit-intro.md)
