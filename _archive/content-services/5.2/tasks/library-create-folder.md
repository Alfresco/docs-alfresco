# Creating folders

The **Library** section of the explorer panel shows the folder structure for the current site. A new site contains just one folder named Documents. Add new folders here.

1.  Choose where you want to add a folder, either by using the explorer panel or by clicking through folders in the file list.

2.  Click **Create** then **Folder**.

3.  Enter a name for the folder.

    The folder name does not support the following special characters: \* " < \> \\ / . ? : and \|. When the name contains a disallowed character the **Save** button is disabled.

    **Note:** The folder name *can* include a period as long as it is not the last character.

4.  Add a title and description for the folder.

5.  Click **Save**.


You'll see the new folder in the explorer panel.
