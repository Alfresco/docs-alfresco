# Setting folders as templates

In the Space Templates folder you can store folders that users can then use as folder templates.

1.  In the **Repository** open the **Data Dictionary** then **Space Templates**.

2.  Click **Create** then **Folder**.

    The new folder is added to the Space Templates folder. You can add content or further folders to this folder to create an entire folder structure. If users create a folder from this template the whole structure and all its contents will be replicated.

    **Note:** If you already have space templates set up, you can select **Create folder from template** from the **Create** menu and create additional templates based on your existing templates.


The file is now available to your users as a template when they select to create content **Create document from template**.
