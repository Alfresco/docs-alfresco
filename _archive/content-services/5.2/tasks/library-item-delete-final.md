# Emptying your trashcan

When you delete content, it is moved to your trashcan. By emptying your trashcan you can permanently remove content.

**Important:** After you empty your trashcan or delete content from it, the content is permanently gone; you can't get it back again.

1.  Open the user menu on the toolbar and clickÂ **My Profile** then the **Trashcan** tab.

    **Tip:** All content that you've deleted is listed here. You can enter a content name in the search field and click **Search** to look for specific content.

2.  Click **Empty** then **OK**.

    By default only 1000 items are deleted at a time.


The content is permanently deleted. You can also permanently delete specific items by clicking **Delete** next to them, or delete multiple items by selecting them and clicking **Selected Items** then **Delete**.

**Parent topic:**[Organizing content](../concepts/library-organize.md)
