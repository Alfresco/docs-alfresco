# Adding users to your site

Now that you've created a site and added content, the next step is to invite other Alfresco Share users to the site.

1.  Click the Add User icon \(![Invite to Site](../images/invite-to-site-icon.png) \) at the top of the dashboard to open the Add Users page.

    **Tip:** You don't need to be on your site dashboard to do this - the **Add Users** option is available from everywhere in your site.

2.  Type the full or partial name of a user you want to invite and click **Search**.

    **Important:** An internal user is someone in your organization. This tutorial will add the test user, Alice Beecher, but if your Alfresco Content Services administrator has already set up users, then you can add real users if you prefer.

3.  Click **Select** to add the user to the **Set User Role** list.

4.  Click **Select Role** and select **Collaborator**.

    **Note:** You can set different roles for different users; take a look at the Alfresco Share [User roles and permissions](../references/permissions_share.md) for more details on user roles.

5.  Click Add Users.


An email notification is sent to each person that you invited and they can start using the site immediately.

This video shows the steps in the tutorial.
