# Accessing the Data Lists component

Access the data lists component to view the lists created for the current site.

In this component you can create new lists, as well as edit and delete any lists that you created.

1.  In a site click **More** then **Data Lists**.

    **Note:** In each site the feature names can be customized. If the site manager has done this, the link might have a name other than **Data Lists**.

    This opens the feature. The browsing pane displays a list of all existing data lists for the current site.


**Parent topic:**[Data lists](../concepts/datalists-intro.md)
