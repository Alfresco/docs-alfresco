# Open Alfresco Share in a browser window

You can use the Share.url to open the Share in a browser window.

The Share.url is a shortcut to Share. It's available in a Windows environment if the Alfresco Content Services repository has been mapped by your administrator so that you can access it from Windows Explorer.

1.  In Windows Explorer go to the location in the repository that you want to open.

    **Note:** The Share.url is only available within site folders, rather than everywhere in the repository.

2.  Double-click the Share.url.

    **Note:** There is a copy of the Share.url at each level of the repository.

    Alfresco Share will open in a browser window, showing the location where you clicked on Share.url.
