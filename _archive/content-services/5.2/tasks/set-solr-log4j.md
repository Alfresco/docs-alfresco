# Setting Solr logging

You can set different debug logging levels for Solr components using the Solr log4j properties.

1.  Locate the <solrRootDir\>/log4j-solr.properties file.

2.  Edit it to add your required logging setting. For example:

    ```
    log4j.logger.org.alfresco.solr.tracker.MetadataTracker=DEBUG
    ```

3.  Changes to the log4j-solr.properties file will be re-read by Solr when it starts up. If you need to make changes to the logging level while the system is running, going to the following URL \(either in a browser or for example, using curl\) will cause Solr to re-load the properties file.

    ```
    https://<solrHostName>:<solrPort>/solr4/admin/cores?action=LOG4J&resource=log4j-solr.properties
    ```
