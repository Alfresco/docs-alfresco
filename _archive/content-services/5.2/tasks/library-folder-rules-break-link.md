# Breaking the link to a rule set

If you don't need your rules anymore, breaking the link is just a single click away. This leaves the folder without any rules.

1.  Hover over a folder with rules applied \(indicated by the ![](../images/rules-icon.png) icon\) and click **More** then **Manage Rules**.

2.  Click **Unlink**.

    **Note:** This option only shows if the folder has linked rules.

    The link between the current folder and the linked rules is now broken.
