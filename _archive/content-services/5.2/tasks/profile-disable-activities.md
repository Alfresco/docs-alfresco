# Disabling site activity notifications

You can disable site activity feeds so that updates from specific sites aren't included in your email notifications or the My Activities dashlet on your dashboard.

1.  Click your user name on the toolbar and click **My Profile**.

2.  Select the **Sites** page.

    **Tip:** You can also access this page by clicking **Sites** then **My Sites** on the toolbar.

3.  Click **Disable Activity Feeds** to disable updates for a site.

    You can do this for as many sites as you want, and you can click **Enable Activity Feeds** to switch feeds back on again.

    **Note:** The My Documents dashlet will still display details of content from the sites you've disabled feeds for.
