# Entering a site

You can access a site from several places in Alfresco Share.

It's easy to get to sites you're a member of from the My Sites dashlet or by clicking **Sites** then **My Sites** on the toolbar. If the site you want to access isn't there, you can search for it on the Site Finder page, or in the search box on the toolbar.

1.  Click **Home**.

2.  On the My Sites dashlet click the name of the site you want to access.

    **Tip:** You can access your favorite sites or recent sites you've visited by selecting them from the Sites menu. There's no need to return to your dashboard.


The dashboard for the selected site appears.

**Parent topic:**[Accessing existing sites](../concepts/site-existing.md)
