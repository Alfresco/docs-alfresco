# Enabling the Subscription Service

Subscriptions in the Admin Console allows you to enable or disable the Follow feature for users to follow each other in Alfresco Share. Users can keep track of other users activities by choosing to follow them.

When users are being followed, the person\(s\) following them receive activity notifications. The Subscription Service is the underlying service used to manage and generate activity notifications. You can use this page to enable/disable the Subscription Service and the follow feature on a system wide basis.

1.  Open the Admin Console.

2.  In the Repository Services section, click **Subscription Service**.

    You see the Subscription Service page.

3.  Use the **Enabled** check box to choose whether to enable or disable the Follow feature for all users:

    -   Select the check box to enable subscriptions
    -   Deselect the check box to disable subscriptions
    The **Enabled** check box is selected by default. This allows users to follow other users and then filter activities according to who they are following. If you disable subscriptions, users will not be able to follow users and they will not see the activities. For example, on the **My Profile** page, the **I'm Following** and **Following Me** options are not visible.

4.  Click **Save** to apply the changes you have made to the properties.

    If you do not want to save the changes, click **Cancel**.
