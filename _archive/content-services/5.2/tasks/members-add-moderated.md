# Approving users to join a moderated site

When a user requests to join a moderated site, the request needs to be approved by a site manager.

All managers of a site will be receive an email and be given a new approval task when a request to join the site is made. Any of the managers can complete this task.

1.  Click **Site Members** then **Pending**.

    You'll see a list of pending requests to join the site.

    **Tip:** You can also click **Tasks** then **My Tasks** to get to the approval task, or access it direct from the notification email that was sent.

    **Note:** You'll also see any Pending Invites. From Alfresco One version 5.1 or later, users are added to sites and invites are only sent if your Alfresco Administrator has specifically configured this option.

2.  Click **Approve**, or click **View** to view the approval task where you can approve, reject, and comment on the request to join.

    The task is cleared from your task list and the user is added to the site.
