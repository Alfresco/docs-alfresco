# Unzipping content

You can unzip .zip and .acp files to add their contents to a folder in Alfresco Share.

This means that you don't need to download a zip file to see its contents. You can quickly upload multiple files at the same time in a zip file, and then unzip them to your preferred location.

1.  Click on a zip or acp file to open the file preview.

2.  Click **Unzip to**.

3.  Choose the site and folder where you want to unzip the files to.

    **Note:** You can only unzip files to sites that you have permission to access.

4.  Click **Unzip**.

    The files are unzipped and you can access them in the folder you chose to put them in. The zip file is still available in its original location.

    **Note:** If you have a zip that contains several thousand files, it might take more than 10 seconds to complete. If this is the case, you might see a message saying that the unzip operation could not be completed. This message is issued because Share has not had confirmation that the unzip operation has completed within 10 seconds. Check the folder where you wanted to unzip the files, to see if the unzip operation completed successfully.

    **Tip:** Alfresco administrators can also use the [Bulk Import tool](../concepts/Bulk-Import-Tool.md) to import multiple files.
