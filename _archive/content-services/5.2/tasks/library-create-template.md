# Creating files from a template

As well as creating files from scratch, you can also create files from templates.

**Note:** Templates are only available if your Alfresco administrator has [set some up for you](../concepts/templated-nodes-intro.md).

1.  Select the folder where you want to add the content.

    The file list displays the current contents of the selected folder. The files you create will be added here.

2.  Click **Create** then **Create document from template**.

    A list of available templates will be displayed.

3.  Select the template.

    A new file based on the template is added to the document library.
