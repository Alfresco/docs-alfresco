# JMX Settings

Use this tool to view and revert JMX settings, and export a JMX dump.

If you've changed settings using JMX, then these are persisted through sessions, but aren't updated in the global properties files. With this tool you can see JMX values that differ from global properties setting. If you want to apply the global property value to the JMX value to resolve any system issues the inconsistency is causing, then click **Revert**.

You can also click **Export** to download a JMX dump.

See [JMX monitoring and management extensions](../concepts/jmx-enhance.md) for more information
