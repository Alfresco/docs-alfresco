# Cancelling a shared link

When you donâ€™t want your publicly shared file to be available anymore, you can break the link. Once you make the link invalid, anyone who tries to access it will be unable to reach the public page.

1.  Find the file you previously shared.

2.  Click **Shared**.

    The window displaying the item's URL appears.

3.  Click **Unshare**.


**Parent topic:**[Sharing files](../tasks/library-item-share.md)
