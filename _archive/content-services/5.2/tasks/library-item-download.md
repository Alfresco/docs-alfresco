# Downloading files

You can quickly download files from Alfresco Share so that you have a local copy.

**Important:** When you select a locked file you're actually downloading the last version that was added to Share, which might be out of date. The user who locked it for editing might have a more recent version of it outside Share.

1.  Hover over a file/folder and click **Download** / **Download as Zip**.

    You are prompted to open or save the file. Depending on your browser settings, the file might be saved automatically to a default location on your computer.

2.  Save the file to your computer.

    **Tip:** You can also select multiple files and/or folders and **Download as Zip** from the **Selected Items** menu.

    **Tip:** If a file is a Microsoft Office, PDF, or other text-based file type \(not an image or video\) then you can also **Download** it in its original format or as a PDF on the file preview screen.
