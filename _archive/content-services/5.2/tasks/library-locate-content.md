# Locate items and folders

When you filter library content using one of the **Documents** or **Tags** explorer views, it is not possible to tell where a file or folder is within the library folder structure. The **Locate File** and **Locate Folder** actions reveal the actual location of a file or folder in the library.

This option is only available if a **Documents** view \(All Documents, I'm Editing, Others are Editing, Recently Modified, Recently Added, or My Favorites\) or **Tag** view is selected in the explorer pane.

1.  Hover the cursor over a file or folder to display the available actions.

    **Tip:** In some views you'll need to click the ![Information icon](../images/ico-information.png) information icon.

2.  Depending on the type of content you have selected, click **Locate File** or **Locate Folder**.


The view updates to show the file/folder in its library location.
