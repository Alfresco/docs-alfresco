# Deleting a comment

Delete a comment to permanently remove it from a blog post.

Only a Site Manager, a Site Collaborator, and the user who created the comment can delete it.

1.  In the Blog browse the posts to find the one whose comment you want to delete.

2.  Click the post title to view the post.

    The post view displays the selected blog post and the related comments.

3.  Position your cursor over the comment you want to delete to display the available actions and then click the ![Delete](../images/ico-delete.png) Delete option.

    This action is available only when the currently signed in user has permission to delete the comment.

    A message prompts you to confirm the deletion.

4.  Click **Delete**.

    The comment is removed from the page.

5.  Click **Blog Post List** to return to the main view.
