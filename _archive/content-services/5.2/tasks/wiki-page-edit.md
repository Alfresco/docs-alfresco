# Editing a wiki page

Edit a wiki page to create new content, edit existing content, and add tags.

1.  In the wiki list find the wiki page you want to edit.

2.  Click **Edit** for that page.

    If the wiki page you want to edit is already open in the page view, simply click **Edit Page**.

    The content of the selected wiki page displays in an editing box.

3.  Edit the content as necessary.

    Use the features provided to format the text; insert bulleted and numbered lists; change the font color; and insert or edit links, anchors, and images. To assist with editing, use the undo, redo, and remove formatting features as needed. Additional functionality includes the ability to insert and customize tables; insert the current date and time; and view the editor in fullscreen mode. The text box includes other features you might find useful; position the cursor over an icon to display its function.

    The **Insert Library Image** feature displays a list of images in the site library. Click a thumbnail in this list to insert the related image into the wiki page at the current cursor position.

    The **Insert Document Link** feature enables you to insert a link to any piece of content in library of the site you are in. Navigate the library to locate the item you want to link to, then click Add. You can select any number of items. Click **OK** to insert links to the selected items at the current cursor position.

    Click and drag the bottom right corner to resize the text editor.

    To create a link to another wiki page, type **\[\[Page Name\]\]**. If the page indicated does not exist, it is automatically created for you. Note that this creates an empty wiki page. It will not appear in the wiki list until you provide content for it.

4.  Edit the tags for this wiki page as necessary.

    You can add and remove existing tags, or create new tags.

5.  Click **Save**.


The page view displays the updated wiki page.
