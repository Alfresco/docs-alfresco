# Linking to a different rule set

If you want to change the rules you're linked to, you can easily link to a different rule set.

1.  Hover over a folder with rules applied \(indicated by the ![](../images/rules-icon.png) icon\) and click **More** then **Manage Rules**.

2.  Click **Change**.

    **Note:** This option only shows if the folder has linked rules.

3.  Select the site then select a folder.

    You can only select locations you have permission to access.

4.  Click **Link**.

    This breaks the link to the original rule set and links you to the new one.

5.  Click **Done**.
