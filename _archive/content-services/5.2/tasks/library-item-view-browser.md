# Viewing a file in a browser

While the preview feature lets you view a file in Alfresco Share, you also have the option of viewing it in your default browser.

1.  Hover over a file in the document library.

2.  Click **View in Browser**.

    A new browser window opens displaying the selected file. For some file types, such as Microsoft Office documents, Share launches the file in its associated program.
