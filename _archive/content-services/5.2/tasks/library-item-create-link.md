# Creating links to content

You can create links to content between Alfresco locations, within a site or across different sites. This is similar to copying content, but instead of creating a new copy, you create a link to the existing file.

1.  Find the file or folder you want to create a link to.

2.  Hover over a file/folder and click **Copy to**.

    **Tip:** In some views you'll need to click the ![Information icon](../images/ico-information.png) information icon.

3.  Choose the site and folder where you want to create a link to the content.

    **Note:** You can only create links in sites that you have permission to access.

4.  Click **Create Link**.

    A link to the content is created. Links to other content have "Link to" added to their name and are represented by the ![Linked file](../images/ico-copied-file.png) and ![Linked Folder](../images/ico-copied-folder.png) icons.


When you click on a linked file or folder, or select **Locate Linked Item**, the original file or folder will be shown in its original site.

**Note:** You can hover over a link and select **Delete Link** to remove it

CAUTION:

If you're using something other than Alfresco Share to access content, for example Alfresco Desktop Sync, then linked files might not be visible.
