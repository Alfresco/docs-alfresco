# Applying the Pass-through example

Restart the Alfresco Content Services server.

The main differences to notice are:

-   All Active Directory users can point their browser to the server and be signed on automatically. \(In Internet Explorer, this requires adding the server to the Local Intranet security zone.\)
-   All Active Directory users can access Alfresco Content Services as a CIFS file system using their Active Directory credentials.
