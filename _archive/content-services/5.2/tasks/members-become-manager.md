# Becoming a site manager

If your account is an administrator account, then you can make yourself a site manager of any site that you're a member of.

**Note:** Users who aren't an Alfresco administrator don't have this option. They need to request a role change from an existing site manager.

1.  In a site click ![](../images/settings-icon.png) then **Become Site Manager**.


You are now a manager of the site. You'll see that you have additional options available when you click ![](../images/settings-icon.png).
