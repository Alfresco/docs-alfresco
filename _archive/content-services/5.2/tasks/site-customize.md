# Customizing a site

Once you've created a site you can customize it to add extra features.

Each new site contains a library, and the site manager can [add other features](../concepts/alfresco-features.md), such as a wiki, a blog, and a calendar. These features can be further customized by renaming, and creating a theme or color scheme. You can also [choose a site homepage](site-addremove-dashboard.md).

1.  Enter a site.

2.  Click ![](../images/settings-icon.png) then **Customize Site**.

3.  Choose a site theme.

4.  Drag and drop pages from the **Available Site Pages** to the **Current Site Pages** to add them to the site.

    You have to move the pages one at a time. You can drag the pages around to reorder them the way you want to see them in the site. The leftmost page will become the site homepage.

    **Note:** You can **Rename** pages or **Remove** them from a site - each of the Current Site Pages displays the option to do this.

5.  Click **OK** to save your changes.


The site dashboard displays the new theme, if one was selected. You can select the new pages by clicking **More** on the dashboard.

With the site customized you can now customize the site dashboard to display information that's relevant to the site.

This video shows you how to customize a site.
