# Sharing Google Docs files

You can share Google Docs files while you are editing them so multiple users can work with a document at the same time.

1.  Hover over a file and click **More** then **Edit in Google Docs**, or select this option from the file preview screen.

    If prompted, authorize Alfresco Share to access your Google Docs account.

    **Note:** If you previously locked this file for editing and are returning to it, you'll be clicking the action **Resume Editing in Google Docs**.

    The file opens in Google Docs. It will be locked in Share so that other users can't edit it while you're working on it. The file stays locked until you either discard or save your changes.

2.  Click **Share**.

3.  Type the email addresses of the people you want to share with in the text box below "Add people." You can add a single person, a mailing list, or choose from your contacts.

4.  Choose the access level from the menu next to each collaborator: **Can view**, **Can comment**, or **Can edit**.

5.  Click **Done**.

    All users you've shared the document with will receive an email with a link to the file. When they click the link they'll be able to view and edit the file while you're in your editing session. When you save the file back to Share or discard the changes they won't be able to edit it any further until you repeat the steps above.

6.  When you've finished your editing close the Google Drive tabs and in your Share editing session click **Save to****Alfresco Share**.
