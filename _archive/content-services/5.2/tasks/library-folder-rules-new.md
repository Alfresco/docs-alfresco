# Adding to a set of rules

A set of rules can include any number of individual rules, and you can add new rules to a folder as you need.

1.  Hover over a folder with rules applied \(indicated by the ![](../images/rules-icon.png) icon\) and click **More** then **Manage Rules**.

2.  Click **New Rule**.

    On the New Rule page you can add a new rule to a set of rules in exactly the same way as the first time you created a rule, see [creating a rule](library-folder-rules-define-create.md).


After creating the last rule you return to the Rules page. Any new rules created are added at the end of the rule set.
