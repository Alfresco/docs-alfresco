# Renaming a wiki page

You rename a wiki page in the page view.

1.  In the wiki list find the wiki page you want to rename.

2.  Click the title of that page.

    The page view displays the selected wiki page.

3.  Click **Rename**.

    The Rename page opens.

4.  Type the new name for the wiki page.

    The wiki page title does not support the following special characters: \\ / . ? \# and \|. When the title contains a disallowed character the **Save** button is disabled.

    **Note:** The title can include a period as long as it is not the last character.

5.  Click **Save**.


The page view reflects the name change and this wiki page retains the history of the original page. A page with the original name is also created. It contains a link to the updated page so that users will not be presented with broken links when using the wiki.
