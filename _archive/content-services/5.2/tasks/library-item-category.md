# Categorizing content

You can categorize files and folders to group similar content into pre-defined categories.

1.  Hover over the content you want to categorize.

    **Note:** You can only categorize content that has the **No Categories** label or displays existing categories. See [Managing Aspects](library-item-manage-aspects.md) for more details on enabling content to be categorizable with the classifiable aspect.

2.  Click **Edit Properties**.

3.  Click the Categories **Select** option.

    The available categories are displayed. You can click on a category to display any sub-categories. Categories are available for use across all sites and by all users.

4.  Click **+** next to each category you want to add. You can categorize files using parent categories and their sub-categories.

5.  Click **OK** the click **Save**.


When you click on a category, either next to content in the document library or in the explorer panel, all content in that category is displayed in the document library.
