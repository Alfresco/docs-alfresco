Alfresco Share content is stored in sites, and each individual site has its own dashboard made up of *dashlets*.
-   **[Your profile and dashboard](../concepts/your-space-intro.md)**  
You can customize your user profile and dashboard however you like without affecting anyone else - you're the only person that sees your dashboard.

-   **[User roles and permissions](../references/permissions_share.md)**
