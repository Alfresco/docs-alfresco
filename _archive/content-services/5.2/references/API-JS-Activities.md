`getFeedControls()` gets feed control objects for the current user.

The `postActivity` methods enable the posting of activities.
-   **[setFeedControl](../references/API-JS-setFeedControl.md)**  
`setFeedControl(siteId, appToolId)` sets the feed control for a site, an appTool, or a site/appTool combination for the current user.
