# Favorites

A favorite describes an Alfresco entity that a person has marked as a favorite. There are API calls for getting a list of a user's favorites, for getting a specific favorite, for adding a favorite, and for deleting a favorite.

To see documentation for methods on this entity, and to try them out on our online REST API explorer, go to [https://api-explorer.alfresco.com/api-explorer/\#/favorites](https://api-explorer.alfresco.com/api-explorer/#/favorites). If you have the REST API explorer running locally, then go to [http://localhost:8080/api-explorer\#/favorites](http://localhost:8080/api-explorer/#/favorites).
