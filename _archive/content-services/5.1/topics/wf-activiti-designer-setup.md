To create Activiti process definitions using a graphical user interface you will need to set up the Activiti designer.

-   **[Installing Eclipse](../tasks/wf-install-eclipse.md)**  
If you do not already have an instance of Eclipse running on your workstation, you will need to install one.
-   **[Installing Activiti designer](../tasks/wf-install-activiti-designer.md)**  
Activiti supplies an Eclipse plugin, the Activiti designer, that can be used to graphically model, test and deploy BPMN 2.0 processes.
