# Installing the Alfresco WARs

A WAR file is a JAR file used to distribute a collection of files \(JavaServer Pages, servlets, Java classes, XML files, tag libraries, and static web pages\) that together constitute a web application.

Use this method of installing if you already have installed a JRE, a supported database, an application server, and the additional Alfresco components.

The Alfresco Enterprise Distribution file is a zip containing the required WAR files, in addition to the additional commands, and configuration files for a manual installation.

1.  Browse to the Alfresco Support Portal at [http://support.alfresco.com](http://support.alfresco.com).

2.  Download the following file:

    alfresco-one-distribution-5.1.5.zip

3.  Specify a location for the download and extract the file.

    You see the following directory structure:

    ```
    alf_data
    amps
    amps_share
    bin
    licenses
    modules
    solr4
    web-server
    ```

    The Distribution zip also contains the following file:

    ```
    README.txt
    ```

    The /alf\_data directory contains the following directory:

    ```
    keystore
    ```

    This directory contains the following files:

    |File name|Description|
    |---------|-----------|
    |browser.p12|The pkcs12 keystore generated from ssl.keystore that contains the repository private key and certificate for use in browsers, such as Firefox.|
    |CreateSSLKeystores.txt|Contains instructions to create an RSA public/private key pair for the repository with a certificate that has been signed by the Alfresco Certificate Authority \(CA\).|
    |generate\_keystores.bat|Windows batch file for generating secure keys for Solr communication.|
    |generate\_keystores.sh|Linux script file for generating secure keys for Solr communication.|
    |keystore|Secret key keystore containing the secret key used to encrypt and decrypt node properties.|
    |keystore-passwords.properties|Contains password protecting the keystore entries.|
    |readme.txt|Text file containing information about other files in a directory.|
    |ssl-keystore-passwords.properties|Contains passwords for SSL keystore.|
    |ssl-truststore-passwords.properties|Contains passwords for SSL truststore.|
    |ssl.keystore|Repository keystore containing the repository private/public key pair and certificate.|
    |ssl.truststore|Repository truststore containing certificates that the repository trusts.|

    The /amps directory contains the following files:

    |File name|Description|
    |---------|-----------|
    |alfresco-share-services.amp|Share Services AMP|

    The /amps\_share directory is empty, but included for any Share AMP files that you install separately.

    **Important:** If you do not apply the Share Services AMP to the Alfresco repository, Alfresco Share will not work correctly, and when you start up Alfresco Share, you will see the message:

    ```
    Alfresco is running without Share Services.  See your System Administrator for more details.
    ```

    See [step 18](simpleinstall-enterprise-lin-share.md#step18) of the wizard install topic for more information.

    The /bin directory contains these files:

    |File name|Description|
    |---------|-----------|
    |
    |Win32NetBIOS.dll|These DLLs handle the connection between the native CIFS server and Alfresco.|
    |Win32NetBIOSx64.dll|
    |Win32Utils.dll|
    |Win32Utilsx64.dll|
    |alfresco-mmt.jar|Alfresco Module Management Tool \(MMT\).|
    |alfresco-spring-encryptor.jar|Alfresco Encrypted Properties Management tool|
    |apply\_amps.bat|Windows batch file for Tomcat application server installs, used to apply all AMP files in the <installLocation\> directory.|
    |apply\_amps.sh|Linux script file for Tomcat application server installs, used to apply all AMP files in the <installLocation\> directory.|
    |clean\_tomcat.bat|Windows batch file for cleaning out temporary application server files from previous installations.|
    |clean\_tomcat.sh|Linux script for cleaning out temporary application server files from previous installations.|

    The /licenses directory contains the following structure:

    ```
    3rd-party
    ```

    This directory contains the third-party license files.

    The /modules directory contains the following directories:

    ```
    platform
    share
    ```

    You can put simple JAR modules in these folders, and they are loaded when Alfresco starts up. See [Simple Module](../concepts/dev-extensions-packaging-techniques-jar-files.md) for more information.

    The /solr4 directory contains the following files and folders:

    |File or folder name|Description|
    |-------------------|-----------|
    |/alfrescoModels|This directory contains all the content models that come out of the box with Alfresco. Any new custom content model added to Alfresco are synced to this directory so that Solr 4 knows about it.|
    |/archive-SpacesStore|Configuration directory for the archive core.|
    |/conf|Contains configuration files.|
    |context.xml|Configuration file specifies the Solr web application context template to use when installing Solr in separate tomcat server.|
    |/lib|This directory contains extra libraries that Solr 4 loads on start up. These libraries are used to communicate with Alfresco by using CMIS, Alfresco data model or Alfresco Surf Web Scripts.|
    |log4j-solr.properties|Configuration file for Solr 4-specific logging.|
    |solr.xml|Configuration file which specifies the cores to be used by Solr 4.|
    |/templates|Â |
    |/workspace-SpacesStore|Configuration directory for the workspace core.|

    The /web-server directory has a standard Tomcat structure, including /shared and /webapps directories.

    The /conf directory contains Catalina repository and Share xml files.

    The /lib directory contains the PostgreSQL JDBC jar file.

    The /shared directory includes the Alfresco configuration files:

    |File name|Description|
    |---------|-----------|
    |/classes/alfresco-global.properties.sample|The sample global properties file, which is used for Alfresco configuration properties.|
    |/classes/encrypted.properties.sample|A sample encrypted properties overlay file.|
    |
    |/classes/alfresco|Contains the Alfresco directory structure for the configuration override files, including the extension, messages, and web-extension directories.|

    The /webapps directory contains these files:

    |File name|Description|
    |---------|-----------|
    |alfresco.war|The Alfresco WAR file|
    |ROOT.war|Application for the server root|
    |share.war|The Alfresco Share WAR file|
    |solr4.war|The Solr 4 WAR file|

4.  Move the WAR files from /webapps to the appropriate location for your application server.

    For example, for Tomcat, move the WAR files to the <TOMCAT\_HOME\>/webapps directory. If you already have a web application that is running in the server root, see [Installing Alfresco into an existing web application](install-server-root.md) for instructions on how to merge the files into your application.

    **Note:** If you are using JBoss, you must customize the web.xml for all WAR files to include this code fragment:

    ```
    <context-param> 
       <param-name> 
          org.jboss.jbossfaces.WAR_BUNDLES_JSF_IMPL 
       </param-name> 
       <param-value>true</param-value
    </context-param>
    ```

    This ensures that the JSF deployer in JBoss uses its own bundled JSF version.

5.  Remove all directories in <TOMCAT\_HOME\>/webapps.

    If you do not remove these directories, then the WAR files are not deployed when the server starts.

6.  Edit the /shared/classes/alfresco-global.properties.sample file with your configuration settings.

7.  Save the file without the .sample extension.

8.  Move the alfresco-global.properties file to <classpathRoot\>.

    For example, <TOMCAT\_HOME\>/shared/classes.


You are now ready to install any additional software that you require. See [Installing additional software for Alfresco](../concepts/prereq-opt-install.md) and [Installing Alfresco integrations](../concepts/install-integrations-overview.md) for more information.

**Note:** If you deployed previous versions of Alfresco, you must remove any temporary files created by your application server. Use the clean\_tomcat.bat or clean\_tomcat.sh command.

**Note:** If you are installing the S3 connector as part of your Alfresco installation, do not start Alfresco before applying the S3 AMP file.

**Important:** After installation, you must generate and install your own certificates to secure the installation. For more information, see [Generating Secure Keys for Solr 4 Communication](generate-keys-solr4.md).
