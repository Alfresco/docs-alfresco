# Managing CIFS authentication

You can configure the CIFS authentication.

1.  Open the Admin Console.

2.  In the Directories section, click **Directory Management**.

    You see the Directory Management page.

3.  In the **CIFS Authentication** section, select a directory from the list to authenticate CIFS. Alternatively, select **Disabled** to disable CIFS authentication.

    **Note:** CIFS uses a challenge or response to authenticate. Only a single directory can be used to authenticate.

4.  Click **Save** to apply the changes you have made to the authentication chain.

    If you do not want to save the changes, click **Cancel**.
