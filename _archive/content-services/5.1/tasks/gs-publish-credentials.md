# Updating your profile

Alfresco user profiles help you to identify who a user is and what they do in your organization.

Your name is displayed at the top of the screen. When you click on the name a menu opens where you can update profile details, change your password, search the help, and log out.

**To update your profile:**

1.  Click your name and select **My Profile**, then click **Edit Profile**.

    **Tip:** You can also select **View My Profile** from the My Profile dashlet.

2.  Enter all the details that you want to show in your profile, including a picture if you like, then click **Save Changes**.

3.  Click **Home** and you can see the updated details in the My Profile dashlet.


When your colleagues view your profile they'll see all the details you've entered.
