# Following people

You can follow users you're interested in so that you can easily keep track of what they've been working on.

1.  Click **People** and search for a user.

    You can also follow users by clicking a user's name when you see it in Alfresco to display their profile page.

2.  Click **Follow**.

    An email is sent telling the user that you're following them. You can't follow a user without them knowing.

3.  Open the **I'm Following** page of your user profile.

    You see a list of the users you are following.

4.  You can select the **Private** check box to hide your I'm Following page from other users.

    **Note:** Even when your list is private, email notifications will be sent to people you choose to follow.

    When your list is private, the I'm Following page doesn't appear to people viewing your profile.

5.  Click **Unfollow** to stop following someone.
