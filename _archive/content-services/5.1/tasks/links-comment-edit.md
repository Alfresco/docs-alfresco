# Editing a link comment

You can edit a comment on a link to modify or add to its content.

Only a Site Manager, a site Collaborator, and the user who created the comment can edit it.

1.  In the Links feature find and click the link containing the comment you want to edit.

    The detail view displays the selected link along with any related comments.

2.  Position your cursor over the comment you want to edit to display the available actions and then click the ![Edit](../images/ico-configure.png) Edit icon.

    This action is available only when the currently logged in user has permission to edit the comment.

    The **Edit Comment** box appears displaying the selected comment.

3.  Make the changes to the comment.

    Use the features provided to format the text; insert bulleted and numbered lists; and change the font color. To assist with editing, use the undo, redo, and remove formatting features as needed.

4.  Click **Save**.

    The updated comment displays.

5.  Click **Links List** to return to the main view.
