# Viewing an event

The calendar displays only the event name and time, so to view full details you must open the event. Once open you can edit or delete the event.

1.  In the calendar find the event you want to view in one of the following ways:

    -   Navigate the calendar on the main view.
    -   Navigate the calendar in the explorer panel and select a date to update the main view calendar.
    -   Click **Agenda** to display upcoming events.
2.  On the main view click the event you are interested in. You can do this in any view: Day, Week, Month, or Agenda.

    The Event Information dialog box displays the full details of the selected event. The Related Content section shows where you can find material associated with the event if a location has been provided. Click the link to jump to that folder in the library.

    If you have the correct permissions you can edit and delete the event from here.

3.  Click **Close** to return to the calendar.
