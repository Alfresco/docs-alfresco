# Editing files in Alfresco

You can edit plain text, HTML, and XML files directly in Alfresco.

**Note:** This action is also available for files configured with the *Inline Editable* aspect.

1.  Hover over a file and click **More** then **Edit in Alfresco**.

    The Edit Content page appears.

2.  Edit the file details and content as required.

    The **Name** does not support the following special characters: \* " < \> \\ / . ? : and \|. When the name contains a disallowed character the **Save** button is disabled.

    **Note:** The folder name *can* include a period as long as it is not the last character. This lets you add an extension \(for example, .txt, .html, or .xml\).

3.  Click **Save**.
