# Deleting content

Delete content to remove it from a site library.

1.  Hover over an file/folder in the library and click **More** then either **Delete Document** or **Delete Folder**.

    When you delete a folder you also delete all of its contents. This includes any content created by others users, even if you don't have permissions to directly delete them.

    **Tip:** In some views you'll need to click the ![Information icon](../images/ico-information.png) information icon.

    A message prompts you to confirm the deletion.

2.  Click **Delete**.


The content is moved to your trashcan. From there you can recover it or delete it permanently.

**Note:** If the file has been [declared as a record](http://docs.alfresco.com/rm/tasks/rm-create-record.html) then the record is still available in the [Records Management site](http://docs.alfresco.com/rm/concepts/rm-intro.html).
