# Editing a blog post

Edit an existing blog post to modify or add to its content.

Only a Site Manager, a Site Collaborator, and the user who created the blog post can edit it.

1.  In the Blog click **Edit** to the right of the post you want to edit.

    **Note:** You can view the post first to ensure it is the one you want to edit, then select **Edit** on the post view page.

    The Edit Blog Post page appears displaying the selected post.

2.  Make the required changes to the post title and content.

    Use the features provided to format the text; insert bulleted and numbered lists; change the font color; and insert or edit links, anchors, and images. To assist with editing, use the undo, redo, and remove formatting features as needed. Additional features are also provided; position the cursor over an icon to display its function.

    Click and drag the bottom right corner to resize the text editor.

3.  Edit the tags for this post as necessary.

    You can add and remove existing tags, or create new tags.

4.  Click **Update** to save the changes.

    **Note:** When you choose this option for a post that has previously been published externally, the text **\(Out of sync\)** appears after the title to indicate the version in the internal blog does not match the version in the external blog.

    The updated post appears as users will see it. The text \(Updated\) appears after the title.

5.  Click **Blog Post List** to return to the main view.
