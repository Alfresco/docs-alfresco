# Renaming content

You can quickly rename files and folders.

1.  Find the file/folder you want to rename.

2.  Hover your cursor over the content name to display the ![Configure icon](../images/ico-configure.png) edit icon.

    **Tip:** In some views you'll need to click the ![Information icon](../images/ico-information.png) information icon.

3.  Click this icon to enter editing mode.

4.  Change the name and click **Save** \(or press ENTER\).

    **Important:** Don't change or delete the filename extension.

    The updated name is shown in the file list.

    **Note:** You can also rename a file or folder by editing its properties.
