# Creating new search filters

In the Search Manager you can quickly create your own custom filters with a wide range of options available.

1.  In the **Search Manager**, accessed from the search results screen, click **Create New Filter**.

    **Tip:** You can also click on an existing Filter ID to edit it.

2.  Enter a **Filter ID** unique identifier for the new search filter.

3.  Enter a **Filter Name**. This is the name of the filter shown in the search results screen. For default filters what is shown here doesn't represent what's shown on the search results screen.

    **Note:** You can't select a custom filter to be a **Default Filter.**

4.  The **Show with Search Results** option is selected by default. Deselect it if you don't want the filter to be shown on the search results screen.

5.  Select a property to filter by from the **Filter Property** drop-down list.

6.  Select a **Filter Type**. This is how the filter is displayed on the search results screen. The default option is **Simple Filter** which is a check box.

7.  Select the **Sort By** order in which the filter results are displayed on the search results page.

8.  Select the **Number of Filters** that are shown by default on the search results screen.

9.  Select the **Minimum Filter Length**. This helps you exclude short words such as "and" and "to" from filter results.

10. Select the **Minimum Required Results** which is the minimum number of matches a filter result must have to be shown on the search results screen.

11. Select the Filter Availability:

    -   **Everywhere** - shown on all sites
    -   **Selected sited** - only shown on selected sites. Click ![](../images/ico-add.png) to add a site then select it from the list and click ![](../images/ico-tick.png) to confirm. Click ![](../images/ico-add.png) to add more sites if required.
12. Click **Save**
