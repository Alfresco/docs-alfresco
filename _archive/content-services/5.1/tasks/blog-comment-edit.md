# Editing a comment

Edit a blog comment to modify or add to its content.

Only a Site Manager, a Site Collaborator, and the user who created the comment can edit it.

1.  In the Blog browse the posts to find the one whose comment you want to edit.

2.  Click the post title to view the post.

    The post view displays the selected blog post and the related comments.

3.  Position your cursor over the comment you want to edit to display the available actions and then click the ![Edit](../images/ico-configure.png) Edit icon.

    This action is available only when the currently logged in user has permission to edit the comment.

    The **Edit Comment** box appears displaying the selected comment.

4.  Make changes to the comment.

    Use the features provided to format the text; insert bulleted and numbered lists; and change the font color. To assist with editing, use the undo, redo, and remove formatting features as needed.

5.  Click **Save**.

    The updated comment displays beneath the post.
