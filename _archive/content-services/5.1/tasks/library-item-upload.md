# Uploading new versions

You can upload content from your computer to update a file.

Doing this to a file you've locked updates the content and removes the lock at the same time. You can also do this to an unlocked file to update it without first downloading it to your computer.

1.  Find the file you want to update.

    **Note:** The **I'm Editing** view shows the files locked by you for editing.

2.  Hover over the file and click **More** then **Upload New Version**.

3.  Click **Select files to upload** on the Update File dialog box.

4.  Find and select the file that you want to upload from your computer.

    **Note:** If you select a file with a different name or file type then this will be shown. You can continue as in the next step, cancel, or select a different file to upload. If you continue then the uploaded file name and/or file type will be used.

5.  Indicate if the revision is minor or major.

6.  In the **Comments** box, add any information that is relevant to the update.

7.  Click **Upload**.

8.  When the progress bar shows that the upload is complete, click **OK**.

    Updating a locked file unlocks it and removes it from the **I'm Editing** view.
