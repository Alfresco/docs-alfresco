# Setting up Cloud Sync

If you have an Alfresco Cloud account you can set up Cloud Sync in your user profile.

1.  Open the user menu on the toolbar and click **My Profile**.

2.  Select the **Cloud Sync** page.

    **Note:** If your Alfresco admin hasn't switched on Cloud Sync then this option won't be available.

3.  Click **Sign in to Alfresco in the Cloud**.

4.  Enter your Alfresco Cloud login details \(email address and password\) and click **Connect**.

    Alfresco validates your credentials and connects you to the cloud. You can disconnect at any time. If you change your Alfresco Cloud password, edit your log in details here to make sure you maintain your connection to the cloud.
