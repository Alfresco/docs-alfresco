# Removing your content from the cloud

When your external collaborators have completed their work on your content, you can remove the content from the cloud.

**To remove your content from the cloud:**

1.  In the Document Library hover your cursor over the document.

2.  Click **More** and then **Unsync from Cloud**.

3.  When you are prompted click the check box for the item and then click **Remove sync**.

    A message will display to confirm that the sync has been removed. Now your external consultants no longer have access to the document.
