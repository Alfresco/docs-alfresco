# Deleting web content

The **Delete** action available within the body of the web page enables you to delete a content item from the document library without opening Share.

1.  On the web page, locate the content you wish to delete.

    **Important:** Deleting the content from the web page deletes the associated content item from the Share document library.

2.  Click the **Delete** icon associated with the content.

    **Note:** This feature is not available on the Alfresco Web Editor toolbar. The content markers must be visible to perform this action.

    A message prompts you to confirm the deletion of the selected content.

3.  Click **OK**.

    A message indicates the selected content has been deleted. The web page refreshes; a message is displayed indicating that the page is not found.
