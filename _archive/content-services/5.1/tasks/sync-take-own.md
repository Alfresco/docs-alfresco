# Becoming sync owner

With Cloud Sync Manager you can identify any failed syncs and take ownership of them so that you can clear them out.

You need to be administrator of both the Alfresco One site and the Alfresco Cloud network to become owner of a sync.

1.  Click **Admin Tools**, and then **Cloud Sync Manager**.

    All synced files and folders are displayed along with their creator, and the reason for any sync failure.

    **Note:** You can use the filters to display specific synced items based on their ID or creator, or just view items where the sync has failed. Click **Apply Filter** to refresh the table to show only the syncs you're interested in.

2.  Click **Actions** and select **Become Owner**. Click **OK** to confirm.

    You are now the owner of this sync and can update or delete it as required.
