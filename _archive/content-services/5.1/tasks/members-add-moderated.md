# Approving users to join a moderated site

When a user requests to join a moderated site, the request needs to be approved by a site manager.

All managers of a site will be given a new task when a request to join the site is made. Any of the managers can complete this task.

1.  Click **Tasks** then **My Tasks**.

2.  Hover over the request to join task and click **Edit Task**.

    The Edit Task page appears displaying the task details.

    **Tip:** You can also access this page from the My Tasks dashlet: click the **Edit Task** icon.

3.  Click **Approve**.

    **Tip:** You can also add a comment if you want.

    The task is cleared from your task list and the user is added to the site.

    You can also click **Reject** to reject the request to join the site.
