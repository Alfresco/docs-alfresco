# Customizing your dashboard

You can change the layout of your dashboard and choose from a number of dashlets to show the information you want to see.

If you want, add multiple copies of each dashlet and then set the filters so that each one displays different information.

**Note:** The Get Started panel links to the Alfresco Help where you can watch help videos. You can always **Hide** it and show it again later.

1.  Click ![Customize Dashboard icon](../images/settings-icon.png) to start customizing your dashboard.

2.  Change the dashboard layout:

    1.  Click **Change Layout**.

    2.  **Select** a layout.

3.  To select your dashlets:

    1.  Click **Add Dashlets**.

    2.  Drag and drop dashlets from the Add Dashlets section onto the columns below.

        **Note:** You can drag and drop dashlets around the columns to change the display order, or to the trash can \(or press DELETE\) to remove them.

        See [What can I do with my dashlets?](../concepts/dashboard-use.md) for more.

4.  Select whether to show or hide the Get Started Panel.

5.  Click **OK** to save the dashboard configuration.

    **Tip:** On your dashboard you can resize most dashlets - just click on the bottom of a dashlet then drag up and down to resize it.


This video shows you how to customize your dashboard in Alfresco.
