# Tagging and categorizing content

You can tag and categorize similar or related content making it easy to find the content again.

Clicking on a category or tag in the explorer panel displays all content associated with that tag or category.

Tags are unstructured and useful for searches, whereas categories actually help you to structure the organization of your content.

Tags and categories are a form of social indexing, and when a tag and category is created it's then available across all your Alfresco sites and can be reused by all users.

**Tags**

Anyone can create tags and then tag content with them. You can tag:

-   Files and folders
-   Wiki pages
-   Blog posts
-   Discussion topics
-   Calendar events
-   Site links

Tagging can be done when you create content, or you can edit existing content to add or remove tags. You can create your own tags or select from a list of tags already used in the current site.

In the **Document Library** you can manage tags in the item list or by editing the content properties. In all the other Alfresco features such as wiki pages and blogs you manage tags in the Tags section when creating or editing content, as follows:

-   **Add a new tag**

    Type a tag in the field provided and then click **Add**. To create several tags at once, separate each tag with a space. To add a multi-word tag, place it in quotation marks \(for example, "draft material"\).

-   **Add an existing tag**

    Click **Choose from popular tags in this site** to display the tags already used in the current site, then click the tag you want to use.

-   **Remove a tag**

    In the list of associated tags, click ![Delete button](../images/ico-delete.png) to remove an existing tag.


**Note:** Data lists don't support tagging.

You can also search for content using tags as the search term.

**Categories**

Unlike tags, which are not in a hierarchy and can be created by anyone, categories must be managed by an administrator.

An example of categories, would be to have Regions as a top level category, then sub-categories of Africa, Asia, Europe, Latin America, North America, and Oceania, then further sub-categories of each of their countries.

Categories can only be associated with library items and folders. Content needs to be enabled for categorizing before you can add it to a category, see [Managing Aspects](library-item-manage-aspects.md).

-   **[Tagging content](../tasks/library-item-tag-inline.md)**  
To make content easier to find you can create and manage tags for files and folders in the document library.
-   **[Categorizing content](../tasks/library-item-category.md)**  
You can categorize files and folders to group similar content into pre-defined categories.
