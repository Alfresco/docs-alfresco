# User dashboard

Wherever you are in Alfresco, you can click **Home** or **User Dashboard** on your user menu to go to your dashboard.

The dashlets on this page give you a simple and up-to-date overview of what's been going on in the sites you're a member of.

**Important:** If you've [set your home page](../tasks/set-homepage.md) then when you click **Home** that page will open.

You can customize your dashboard to display the information that interests you. Each dashlet you select is displayed on the dashboard. The available dashlets are:

-   **My Sites**

    Displays the sites that you belong to

-   **My Activities**

    Tracks the most recent activities in your sites

-   **My Tasks**

    Displays your tasks

-   **My Documents**

    Tracks your content in all site libraries

-   **My Profile**

    Displays a summary of your personal details

-   **My Calendar**

    Displays upcoming events scheduled for your sites

-   **Content I'm Editing**

    Displays the last three library items, blog posts \(drafts, not published posts\), wiki pages, and discussion forum posts that you edited

    Display a website which you select by hovering over the dashlet on your dashboard

You can resize most dashlets.

To resize a dashlet click and drag on the bottom edge of the dashlet until it's the height you want. This is saved between Alfresco sessions.

**Tip:** If you hover over a dashlet header then a ![Add Event icon](../images/help-1.png) icon appears. Click it for an explanation of what the dashlet does. This stays open until you close it or navigate away from the dashboard.

As well as giving you an overview of activity and information in Alfresco, the dashlets also give you links to various areas of Alfresco and let you carry out a range of actions.
