# Custom Smart Folders

Custom Smart Folders are similar to System Smart Folders, except that you select the template from anywhere in your repository.

These are the key elements of the Custom Smart Folder:

-   Best used to apply multiple taxonomies to find content in context
-   Allows use of Smart Folder Templates that are located anywhere in the repository
-   Loaded using the Custom Smart Folder \(smf:customConfigSmartFolder\) aspect
-   Selected using the Smart Folder Template specific to your custom template

Advanced Smart Folders settings are provided in the <tomcat\>/shared/classes/alfresco-global.properties.sample file.

See [Enabling Smart Folders](../tasks/sf-config-examples.md) and [Applying multiple templates](../tasks/sf-tutorial-multi.md) for more information.
