# Template usage

Templates are used widely in Alfresco to render the view of a MVC pattern.

Templates are widespread throughout Alfresco: they are used within the repository core to generate emails and activities, in the web client to build custom views, at the remote REST API layer, and also as the default rendering mechanism for the web script and Surf frameworks.

The template engine is not tied to any output file format: templates can output entire HTML files as well as snippets of HTML, XML, JSON, or any other format. This makes them extremely flexible and appropriate for developing all kinds of solutions with Alfresco.
