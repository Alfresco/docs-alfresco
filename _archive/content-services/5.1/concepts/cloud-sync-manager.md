# Managing cloud syncs

With Cloud Sync Manager, Alfresco administrators have full visibility of all files and folders that have been synced from their organization to Alfresco Cloud sites, including their original and cloud locations, and the user who synced them.

Several filters are available so that you can search for specific synced items based on their ID or creator, or just view items where the sync has failed.

Syncs to cloud can fail for a number of reasons, such as the sync creator being removed from the system. If you have too many failed syncs on your network this can cause problems with all synced items. With Cloud Sync Manager you can identify any failed syncs and take ownership of them so that you can clear them out.

You can also **Export** sync details as a csv file.

**Note:** Click the Original Item Location to view more details in the [Node Browser](../tasks/adminconsole-nodebrowser.md).
