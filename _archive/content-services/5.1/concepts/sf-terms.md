# Smart Folders terminology

Special terms used to describe Smart Folders.

-   **Filing rule**

    A filing rule is specified in a Smart Folder Template and defines where a new file is stored in the repository, when it is uploaded to a Smart Folder. The filing rule also specifies the type and aspects that are applied to the new file, along with its property values.

-   **Smart Folder**

    A Smart Folder displays the results of a query in a folder format. It is “smart”, because there is no physical folder to represent it in the repository and the results are created dynamically. A Smart Folder can also contain a hierarchy of Smart Folders.

-   **Smart Folder Template**

    A Smart Folder Template is a JSON file that is stored in Alfresco in Repository/Data Dictionary/Smart Folder Templates. When the template is run in a physical folder, a Smart Folder structure is created.
