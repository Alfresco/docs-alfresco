# Using templates

With templated nodes and space templates you can store content and folder templates in Alfresco repositories that users can then use to create content.

Templated nodes provide a convenient way for users to quickly create content based on a pre-determined style, such as documents already formatted to company guidelines. Once a template has been stored in the Alfresco repository users can create new content items based upon it from the **Create** menu in the **Document Library**.

Space templates let users quickly create folders. Content or other folder structures can be contained in the folder and are replicated when a folder is created from the template. Once a template has been stored in the Alfresco repository users can create new folders based upon it from the **Create** menu in the **Document Library**.

You can have an unlimited number of templated nodes and space templates.
