# How to split

When you have decided to upgrade from a single node environment to a distributed or clustered environment, you must find the most appropriate way to cluster Alfresco's architecture.

-   **[Scenario: Clustering for redundancy](../concepts/cluster-scenario-redundancy.md)**  
This is a scenario-based topic describing the clustering architecture for redundancy and high availability of Alfresco services.
-   **[Scenario: Clustering for high throughput](../concepts/cluster-scenario-throughput.md)**  
This is a scenario-based topic describing the clustering architecture for maximizing throughput of Alfresco services.
