# What can I do with my dashlets?

As well as giving you an overview of activity and information in Alfresco, the dashlets also give you links to various areas of Alfresco and let you carry out a range of actions.

**Tip:** When a user name, site name, or item appears as a link, you can click it to navigate to the related page.

Each dashlet has a unique role in Alfresco:
