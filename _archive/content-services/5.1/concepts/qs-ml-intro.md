# Creating multi-lingual websites

The Government website that is included with Web Quick Start is an example of a multi-lingual based website. The multi-lingual features allow you to easily set up your site to include, organize, and manage one or more translations of your website content.

Up to this point you have been working with the Finance site. The examples refer to the **Government** sample site.

-   **[Preparing a section for translation](../tasks/qs-ml-section-prepare.md)**  
To create separate editions of your website for different locales, you begin by making the top-level section translatable. Once you set the locale for the existing content you can create sections to hold the translated content.
-   **[Translating an asset within a translated section](../tasks/qs-ml-section-translate.md)**  
Once you have prepared the website section that you want to translate, you can begin creating translations for the existing website assets.
-   **[Translating an asset that is not in a translated section](../tasks/qs-ml-asset-translate.md)**  
You can choose to translate individual assets rather than managing translations for an entire section.
