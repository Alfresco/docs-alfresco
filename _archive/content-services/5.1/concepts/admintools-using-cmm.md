# Managing custom types, aspects, and properties

You can create and manage custom types, aspects, and properties for your models using the Model Manager tool.

-   **[Creating new custom types and aspects](../tasks/admintools-custom-type-create.md)**  
A model can have one or more custom types and aspects. You can create new custom types and aspects using the Model Manager.
-   **[Editing custom types and aspects](../tasks/admintools-custom-type-edit.md)**  
Use this information to edit a custom type and an aspect.
-   **[Deleting custom types and aspects](../tasks/admintools-custom-type-delete.md)**  
The delete action on a custom type and aspect depends on the status of the model.
-   **[Creating a new property for custom types and aspects](../tasks/admintools-ct-properties-create.md)**  
Properties are pieces of metadata associated with a particular custom type and / or aspect. Both types and aspects can have one or more properties.
-   **[Editing a property for custom types and aspects](../tasks/admintools-ct-properties-edit.md)**  
Use this information to edit a type property.
-   **[Deleting a property for custom types or aspects](../tasks/admintools-ct-properties-delete.md)**  
The delete action on a property depends on the status of the model and whether or not the property has been applied to a file in Alfresco Share.
-   **[Configuring models - custom types, aspects, and properties](../concepts/admintools-cmm-info.md)**  
Depending on the status of the model, the Model Manager tool limits which fields you can edit while configuring or editing models.
-   **[Using the Layout Designer](../tasks/admintools-form-builder.md)**  
Use the Layout Designer to define how the properties you create using the Model Manager are displayed on the **Edit Properties** page in Alfresco Share.
