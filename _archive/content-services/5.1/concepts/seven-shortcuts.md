# Tips for Alfresco administrators

If you're an Alfresco administrator, use these tips to help you manage your environment.

1.  Make sure you use a transactional database.
2.  Keep your Search indexes on your fastest local disk.
3.  Version only what and when you need to.
4.  If you find yourself constantly creating the same space hierarchy as well as rules and aspects to them, consider creating a Space template instead.
5.  Increase the database connection pool size for large numbers of concurrent users or sessions.
6.  Use the System Information to view system properties, such as schema and server versions.
7.  Use the Node Browser \(searchable by node reference, xpath, or lucene\) to view all properties, parent and child nodes, aspects applied, permissions, and associations.
