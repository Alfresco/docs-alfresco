# Alfresco One overview

Alfresco One is a hybrid cloud Enterprise Content Management \(ECM\) platform that manages and synchronizes content across on-premises and cloud repositories. Industry-leading mobile support and a wide range of application integrations allow users to access and collaborate on content wherever and however they work. Alfresco Oneâ€™s open, modern architecture maximizes flexibility, allowing companies to meet unique and evolving business needs with much less effort and expense than proprietary ECM systems require.

With Alfresco One, document management, collaboration, and process automation can be synced to the cloud, avoiding the risks associated with uncontrolled consumer file sharing and enabling secure collaboration outside of the firewall.

Alfresco is an enterprise content platform that you can use in the cloud or behind your firewall. It helps you to store and share the documents that every business depends on.

The Alfresco content platform allows you to manage any type of content: from simple office documents, to scanned images, photographs, and even large video files. The built-in workflow feature allows companies to automate document-intensive business processes, saving time and money. The native collaboration features enable secure collaboration, inside or even outside the firewall.

-   **[Content applications](../concepts/apps-content-about.md)**  
 Alfresco can be used for building most ECM applications. Aside from the major applications such as document, image, records, digital asset, and web content management, there are a number of specific applications and use cases that add value to the enterprise.
-   **[Alfresco One architecture](../concepts/alfresco-arch-about.md)**  
At the core of the Alfresco system is a repository supported by a server that persists content, metadata, associations, and full text indexes. Programming interfaces support multiple languages and protocols upon which developers can create custom applications and solutions. Out-of-the-box applications provide standard solutions such as document management and records management.
