# Your profile and dashboard

You can customize your user profile and dashboard however you like without affecting anyone else - you're the only person that sees your dashboard.

Some of your user profile details are visible to your colleagues so it's good to keep these details up to date.

-   **[Customizing your dashboard](../tasks/dashboard-customize.md)**  
You can change the layout of your dashboard and choose from a number of dashlets to show the information you want to see.
-   **[Setting your home page](../tasks/set-homepage.md)**  
Your default Alfresco home page is your user dashboard, but you can set it to be any page in Alfresco that you have access to.
-   **[Updating your profile](../tasks/profile-edit.md)**  
Alfresco user profiles help you to identify a user's roles and responsibilities, or even find out who's who in your organization by checking profile pictures.
-   **[Following people](../tasks/profile-follow.md)**  
You can follow users you're interested in so that you can easily keep track of what they've been working on.
-   **[Controlling your email notifications](../tasks/profile-notifications.md)**  
Choose whether or not you want to receive notifications by email. The emails keep you up to date on events such as recent site activities.
-   **[Disabling site activity notifications](../tasks/profile-disable-activities.md)**  
You can disable site activity feeds so that updates from specific sites aren't included in your email notifications or the My Activities dashlet on your dashboard.
-   **[Changing your password](../tasks/profile-password.md)**  
Change your password for increased security.
