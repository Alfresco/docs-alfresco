# Installing and configuring Alfresco Office Services

Alfresco Office Services \(AOS\) allow you to access Alfresco directly from all your Microsoft Office applications.

Installing Alfresco Office Services allows Microsoft Office Suite applications \(for example, Word, PowerPoint, and Excel\) to interact with Alfresco similar to SharePoint. This feature allows you to edit Office documents in Alfresco Share and to modify Office files without checking them in and out. Alfresco locks the file while it is being modified and releases the lock when the file is saved and closed.

AOS replaces and enhances the Microsoft SharePoint Protocol Support that was available in previous versions of Alfresco.

For more information about Alfresco Office Services, see [Alfresco Office Services](http://docs.alfresco.com/aos1.1/concepts/aos-intro.html).
