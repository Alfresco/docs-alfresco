# Setting up content stores

A content store provides low-level access to stored binaries ensuring that, for every write, a new binary storage location is made available. This information gives an overview on the content stores, their types, and configuration details with examples.



-   **[Content stores overview](../concepts/cs-overview.md)**  
Background information on the content store and content binary life cycle.
-   **[Content store types](../concepts/cs-types.md)**  
By default, Alfresco is configured to save files or content items in the File content store and orphaned files in the Deleted content store. Alfresco also provides other content stores, which may be used in place of or in addition to the default stores. This information provides an overview on the File content store and additional content stores that you can use with Alfresco.
-   **[Content store selector](../concepts/store-manage-content.md)**  
The content store selector provides a mechanism to control the store used for the content file associated with a particular content item.
-   **[Managing content stores](../concepts/cs-manage.md)**  
Use this information to effectively manage the File content store and Deleted content store.
