# Upgrading

This information walks through how to upgrade your project to use a newer version of Alfresco. It also takes you through the process of upgrading your project to use a newer version of the SDK.

There are two areas:

-   Upgrading the Alfresco Product version
-   Upgrading the Alfresco SDK version

-   **[Upgrading Alfresco version for an extension project](../concepts/alfresco-sdk-upgrading-alfresco-version.md)**  
When you have been working with your extension project for a while it is highly likely that there have been some new releases of the Alfresco software. These releases will have new functionality that you might want to take advantage of in your project. It might also be that you are starting to work with this SDK version a while after it has been released, and latest Alfresco version is now newer than what is default in the SDK. This section will walk through how you can upgrade your SDK project to use the newest Alfresco version.
-   **[Upgrading SDK version for an extension project](../concepts/alfresco-sdk-upgrading-sdk-version.md)**  
This section describes how to upgrade the SDK version that is used by your extension project.
