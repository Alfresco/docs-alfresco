# Managing site members

Site users can easily see who else is a member of the site, and site managers can edit user roles and remove a user from the site.

Enter a site and click **Site Members** to view or search for members of the site.

-   **Users**

    Use this page to search for a site member or view a list of all members. A site manager can add users, edit user roles, and remove site members from here.

-   **Groups**

    Use this page to search for a site group or view a list of all groups. A site manager can add groups to the site, change a group's role, and remove a site group from here.

-   **Pending Invites**

    Use this page to view users who have been invited to join the site. You can cancel invitations here. Only site managers see the Pending Invites page.

    **Note:** From Alfresco One version 5.1 or later, invites are only sent if your Alfresco Administrator has specifically configured this option. Unless they have then users can access a site as soon as they are added by a Site Manager.
