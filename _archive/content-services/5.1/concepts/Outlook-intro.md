# Using Alfresco from Microsoft Outlook

Alfresco Outlook Integration allows you to use email and repository management without having to leave Microsoft Outlook.

You can directly archive emails into Alfresco, use the full metadata support, full search, tagging and workflow capabilities, and attach files and view archived emails in your inbox.

For more information about Alfresco Outlook Integration, see [Alfresco Outlook Integration](http://docs.alfresco.com/outlook2.1/concepts/Outlook-overview.html).
