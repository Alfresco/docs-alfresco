# Do great work

This is the end of the Alfresco One Getting Started guide, and you should now be able to use Alfresco in ways that will improve how you work on a day to day basis.

In this tutorial you've learnt how to:

-   Customize your own Alfresco dashboard and user profile
-   Create a site where your team can share content and collaborate
-   Work with different kinds of content and add it to your site
-   Add users to your site, set up meetings, and use social media-style features
-   View and understand site activities
-   Share content on the cloud with external collaborators

This is just the beginnings of what you can achieve with Alfresco; we'd really recommend that you take some time to look at our other learning resources and try out other features that will help you to do great work:

-   Read the [\(Using Alfresco\)](master-using-intro.md) documentation on other features
-   Watch the Alfresco 'How To' videos [\('How To' videos\)](../topics/alfresco-video-tutorials.md)
-   Explore [Alfresco in the Cloud](http://docs.alfresco.com/cloud/topic/com.alfresco.cloud.doc/concepts/welcome-infocenter-cloud.html)
-   Use other site components such as discussion forums[\(Discussion forums\)](discussions-intro.md), blogs[\(Blogs\)](blog-intro.md), and data lists [\(Data lists\)](datalists-intro.md)
