# Installing Alfresco manually

Use this information to manually install Alfresco One.

-   **[Prerequisites for installing Alfresco](../concepts/prereq-install-overview.md)**  
Use this information to review your system before you manually install Alfresco.
-   **[What you need to install Alfresco](../concepts/download-enterprise.md)**  
There are a number of different installation files available to you, each of which you can choose depending on what is already installed on your system.
-   **[Installing Alfresco on Tomcat](../tasks/alf-tomcat-install.md)**  
For more complex Alfresco installations or if you wish to use an existing Tomcat application server, you can use the Web Archive \(WAR\) bundle to install Alfresco on any platform. For this type of installation, you must ensure that the required software is installed on the machine.
-   **[Installing Alfresco on other web applications](../concepts/other-apps-install.md)**  
Use this information if you are using an application server other than Tomcat.
-   **[Tailoring your Alfresco installation](../concepts/remove-apps-install.md)**  
When installing Alfresco, an important part of the configuration process is the removal of any unused applications. Use this information to determine any applications that you might want to remove from your Alfresco installation and how to remove them.
-   **[Installing an Alfresco Module Package](../tasks/amp-install.md)**  
An Alfresco Module Package \(AMP\) is a bundle of code, content model, content, and the directory structure that is used to distribute additional functionality for Alfresco. Use the Module Management Tool \(MMT\) to install and manage AMP files. You can install an AMP in an Alfresco WAR using the MMT, or by using the `apply_amps` tool.
-   **[Installing additional software for Alfresco](../concepts/prereq-opt-install.md)**  
The third-party software used by Alfresco is installed when you use the setup wizards to install Alfresco. If you wish to install the third-party software independently, this information describes the steps for obtaining and installing the software. Some of the software can be installed any time before or after installing Alfresco.
