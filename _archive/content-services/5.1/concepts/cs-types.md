# Content store types

By default, Alfresco is configured to save files or content items in the File content store and orphaned files in the Deleted content store. Alfresco also provides other content stores, which may be used in place of or in addition to the default stores. This information provides an overview on the File content store and additional content stores that you can use with Alfresco.
