# Getting started

This information covers the use case of extending the Alfresco Share User Interface with extra functionality, such as displaying custom metadata and custom workflow forms.

The Alfresco Share User Interface provides a number of extension points where custom functionality can be plugged in and run embedded with the rest of the Share code. This is functionality that is not related to the platform and that does not fit the remote integration use case.
