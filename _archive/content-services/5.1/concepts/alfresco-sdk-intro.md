# Alfresco SDK 2.2.0

This documentation covers version 2.2.0 of the Alfresco SDK. The Alfresco SDK is a Maven based development kit that provides an easy to use approach to developing applications and extensions for Alfresco.

With this SDK you can develop, package, test, run, document and release your Alfresco extension project. It is important to note that while previous versions of the Alfresco SDK were based around Ant, the latest versions of the SDK are based on Maven.

The latest version of the SDK is **Alfresco SDK 3.0**. See the [Developer guide](https://docs.alfresco.com/5.2/concepts/sdk-intro.html) for details.

For earlier releases of the Alfresco SDK, see the **Previous versions** section of [http://docs.alfresco.com](https://docs.alfresco.com).

The Alfresco SDK 2.2 includes a number of Maven archetypes. These archetypes aim to provide a standardized approach to development, release, and deployment of Alfresco extensions.
