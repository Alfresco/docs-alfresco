# Configuring Enterprise to Cloud Sync

Use this information to enable and disable Enterprise to Cloud Sync.

Â 

-   **[Enabling Enterprise to Cloud Sync](../tasks/cloud-sync-config-enable.md)**  
To enable synchronization from your on-premise Alfresco server, you need an Enterprise Alfresco subscription and an Alfresco license that contains the synchronization feature.
-   **[Disabling Enterprise to Cloud Sync](../tasks/cloud-sync-config-disable.md)**  
If your Alfresco license contains Enterprise to Cloud Sync access, then synchronization is enabled by default when you apply the license. You have the option to disable this feature if you prefer not to make it available to your users.
-   **[Enterprise to Cloud Sync on replica on-premise instances](../concepts/cloud-sync-config-instances.md)**  
Alfresco does not support Enterprise to Cloud Sync running simultaneously from identical Alfresco Enterprise instances to Alfresco Cloud.
