# Sites Manager

The Sites Manager is used for maintaining Alfresco sites. You have control over the visibility of all Alfresco sites as well as deleting sites or making yourself a site manager.

**Note:** Sites Manager is available to users in the `ALFRESCO_ADMINISTRATORS` and `SITES_ADMINISTRATORS` permissions groups. If you are in the `ALFRESCO_ADMINISTRATORS` group, you can access the Site Manager through the **Admin Tools** on the Alfresco toolbar. If you are a member of `SITE_ADMINISTRATORS` group, you'll have an additional **Sites Manager** option on the Alfresco toolbar.

The Sites Manager displays the names and status of created sites, regardless of their visibility setting. You can use the **Visibility** menu to change the visibility of any site, for example, change the site visibility to either **Public**, **Moderated**, or **Private**. Any visibility change you make to a site is made immediately.

With the **Actions** menu, there are two options:

-   **Delete Site**
-   **Become Site Manager**

You can delete any of the sites in the Site Manager list by selecting **Delete Site** from the **Actions** menu. This action deletes all site details and content.

The I'm a Site Manager column shows the sites where you have the Site Manager permission. If you aren't already a manager of a site, then select **Become Site Manager** from the **Actions** menu.
