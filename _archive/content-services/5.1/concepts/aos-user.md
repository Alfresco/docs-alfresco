# Using Alfresco from Microsoft Office

With Alfresco Office Services \(AOS\) you can access Alfresco directly from your Microsoft Office applications.

This means that you can browse, open, and save Microsoft Office files \(Word, PowerPoint, and Excel\) in Alfresco without the need to access Alfresco through Chrome, Firefox, or another web browser.

You can also browse Alfresco from Windows Explorer, or map a network drive to Alfresco.

For more information about Alfresco Office Services, see [Alfresco Office Services](http://docs.alfresco.com/aos/concepts/aos-user.html).
