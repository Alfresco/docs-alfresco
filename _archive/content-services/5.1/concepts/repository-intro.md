# Repository

The **Repository** displays all the Alfresco content that you have access to, including content of all sites that you're a member of.

**Note:** If the **Repository** isn't available on the Alfresco toolbar, contact your system administrator.

The **Repository** includes all of the usual document library functionality with the exception of the **Edit Offline** action and the ability to create Google Docs content.

Just as in a document library, the explorer panel includes navigation and filtering options. This lets you filter the repository contents by category or tag, or you can browse the repository file structure. You can also choose to view the content items currently checked out to you \(**I'm Editing** view\) or those that you've specifically flagged as favorites \(**My Favorites** view\).

The functionality available within the Repository library is identical to what you find in a site library. See [Working with content in a library](library-intro.md) for details on performing specific actions within the **Repository**.
