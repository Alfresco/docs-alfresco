# Setting up clustering

You can implement multiple Alfresco instances in a clustered environment.

A cluster represents a collection of nodes. Clustering is implemented in Alfresco to provide high scalability and resilience. Improved performance is enhanced through redundant nodes that provide services when other nodes fail. When integrated with a load balancer, performance is enhanced by distributing, or balancing, server workload across a collection of nodes.
