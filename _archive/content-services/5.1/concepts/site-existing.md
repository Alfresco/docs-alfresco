# Accessing existing sites

Accessing an existing Alfresco site is easy.

You can search for sites using the Site Finder, the search box on the Alfresco toolbar, or you might receive an email notification that you've been added to a site.

If you see a link to a site anywhere in Alfresco, just click the link to have a look.

You can see all the sites you're a member of by clicking **Sites** then **My Sites** on the Alfresco toolbar.

-   **[Joining a site](../tasks/sites-manage.md)**  
When you join sites you gain access to the content that's stored on them.
-   **[Leaving a site](../tasks/sites-leave.md)**  
It's quick and easy to leave a site when you no longer want to be a member.
-   **[Entering a site](../tasks/dashboard-site-enter.md)**  
You can access a site from several places in Alfresco.
-   **[Moving around a site](../tasks/page-select.md)**  
The default areas available in a site are the **Site Dashboard**, **Document Library**, and the **Site Members** areas. If a site has additional site features then you'll also see a **More** menu.
