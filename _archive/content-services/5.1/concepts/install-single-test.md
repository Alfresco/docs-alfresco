# Test and familiarize after installing Alfresco

You have successfully installed the out-of-box Alfresco application. Now you can test and gain familiarity with the core features and function of Alfresco.

Here are some tips to familiarize yourself with Alfresco.

**Note:** Alfresco recommends that you create a test site for testing purpose and put all your test data in that site.

-   Can you login to Alfresco using your user name and password. See [Logging in](../tasks/gs-login.md).
-   Can you create a collaboration site. See [Creating your first Collaboration site](../tasks/gs-site-create.md).
-   Can you add new users to the collaboration site. See [Adding users to a site](../tasks/members-invite.md).
-   Can you add pages to the collaboration site. See [Adding pages to a site](../tasks/gs-customize-site.md).
-   Can you add content to a site library. See [Adding content items](../tasks/gs-content-add.md).
-   Can you copy or move content from its current location to another folder or any other site. See [Copying content](../tasks/library-item-copy.md) and [Moving content](../tasks/library-item-move.md).
-   Can you update/ edit content. See [Updating content](../tasks/library-item-upload.md).
-   Can you manage permissions for a user or a group for accessing content. See [Managing content permissions](../tasks/library-item-permissions.md).
-   Can you add a new rule to a folder in the site library and check if it works. See [Adding a new rule](../tasks/library-folder-rules-new.md).
-   Can you edit the new rule. See [Editing a rule](../tasks/library-folder-rules-edit.md).
-   Can you schedule events, such as meeting, for your team. See [Scheduling events](../tasks/gs-webinar-schedule.md).

**Note:** After you have finished testing, remember to delete the test site or test data in order to clear your database. Alternatively, if you have made any configuration changes, it is recommended that you [Uninstall Alfresco](../tasks/uninstall-alfresco.md) and then [Reinstall Alfresco](installs-eval-intro.md) to get a clean database.
