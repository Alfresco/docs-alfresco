# Using the Document Transformation Server

The Document Transformation Server is used when you upload files to Alfresco, and you can see results in the Share preview.

Administrators can view information about the server and transformation errors using the Web Console.

-   **[Using the Document Transformation Server Web Console](../tasks/transerv-webconsole.md)**  
Use the Document Transformation Server Web Console to view information about the server and transformation errors. The server provides the status of the server, a historical view of all the transformations completed, and the number of successful and failed transformations.
