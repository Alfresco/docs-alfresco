# Building a site

Now that you've personalized your own dashboard and profile, you're ready to set up a site.

Collaboration in Alfresco is based around the concept of creating sites that teams can share content in, but an Alfresco site is more than just a place to share and manage content. You can schedule and manage meetings and calendars, publish blogs and set up forums where you can have team discussions, and even write content online and publish it to a wiki.

-   **[Creating a new site](../tasks/gs-site-create.md)**  
The first thing that you need to do is to create a site and choose its settings.
-   **[Customizing the site dashboard](../tasks/gs-customize-dashboard.md)**  
A site dashboard displays all information and activities associated with the site. You can customize the site dashboard just as you did with your personal dashboard.
-   **[Adding features to a site](../tasks/gs-customize-site.md)**  
In Alfresco you can add features to your site such as a discussion forum, a wiki, or a blog.
