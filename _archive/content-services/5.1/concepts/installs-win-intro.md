# Using the Alfresco installers on Windows

Use this information to install Alfresco on Windows, using the Alfresco One, Alfresco One Platform, and Alfresco One Share Installers.

-   **[Installing Alfresco on Windows using the Alfresco One Installer](../tasks/simpleinstall-enterprise-win.md)**  
The setup wizard for Microsoft Windows installs all the software and components that you require for running Alfresco. This setup wizard installs Alfresco and additional software, including a Tomcat application server, PostgreSQL database, JRE, and LibreOffice.
-   **[Installing Alfresco on Windows using the Platform Installer](../tasks/simpleinstall-enterprise-win-platform.md)**  
The Alfresco One Platform Installer for Windows installs the Alfresco repository and all the software and components that you require for running the Alfresco platform; for example, a Tomcat application server, PostgreSQL database, JRE, LibreOffice, Solr 4 and other required software like ImageMagick. It does not install Alfresco Share.
-   **[Installing Alfresco on Windows using the Share Installer](../tasks/simpleinstall-enterprise-win-share.md)**  
The Alfresco One Share Installer for Windows installs Alfresco Share only, with its own Tomcat application server and the Share Services AMP.
