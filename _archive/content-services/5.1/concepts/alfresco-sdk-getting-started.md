# Getting Started with the Alfresco SDK

This information gets you started with the Alfresco SDK. The Alfresco SDK itself does not need to be installed \(as it is based around Maven\), but there are some prerequisites that will need to be made available.

This information is split into three areas:

-   Installing software that is a prerequisite for running the SDK successfully
-   Getting the SDK working from the command line
-   Getting the SDK working from IDEs

-   **[Before you begin](../concepts/alfresco-sdk-before-you-begin.md)**  
There are some points you need to be aware of before you start using the Alfresco SDK.
-   **[Installing and configuring software](../concepts/alfresco-sdk-installing-prerequisite-software.md)**  
Use this information to install and configure the software on which the SDK depends.
-   **[Creating a project](../concepts/alfresco-sdk-tutorials-archetypes.md)**  
The following tutorials take you step by step through how to create and run projects using the standard archetypes provided by the Alfresco SDK.
