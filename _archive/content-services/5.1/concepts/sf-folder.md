# Type-based, System, and Custom Smart Folders

There are three ways to attach Smart Folders to physical folders.

Each method assigns a Smart Folder Template to a physical folder, which is then immediately available to all users.

-   **[Type-based Smart Folders](../concepts/sf-folder-type.md)**  
Type-based Smart Folders replicate a Smart Folder structure and apply it to many folders of a specific type, or carrying a specific aspect.
-   **[System Smart Folders](../concepts/sf-folder-system.md)**  
System Smart Folders are best used when you want to see content \(that is distributed across the repository\) in context; for example, all my files, or all files that are tagged as confidential.
-   **[Custom Smart Folders](../concepts/sf-folder-custom.md)**  
Custom Smart Folders are similar to System Smart Folders, except that you select the template from anywhere in your repository.
