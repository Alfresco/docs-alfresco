# Presentation web scripts

Presentation web scripts let you customize and extend the web UI. They typically render HTML and can include browser-hosted JavaScript.

Unlike data web scripts, presentation web scripts can be hosted in the Alfresco content application server or in a separate presentation server. When hosted separately, presentation web scripts in the presentation server interact with data web scripts in the Alfresco content application server by using the Repository REST API.
