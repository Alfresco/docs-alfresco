# Surf tutorials

Tutorials demonstrating how to use Surf.

The tutorials use the Alfresco SDK to create a basic Surf project archetype. This provides a foundation on which to build your own Surf-based projects.

-   **[Creating a Surf project](../tasks/surf-tutorials-create-surf-project.md)**  
A Surf project can be created most conveniently using the Alfresco SDK 2.0.
-   **[Exploring root objects](../tasks/surf-tutorials-exploring-root-objects.md)**  
When running in the presentation tier, there are a number of root objects available to your Surf project.

**Parent topic:**[Presentation-tier web scripts](../concepts/ws-presentation-intro.md)
