# Metadata inheritance

You can set files and folders to inherit metadata using Smart Folders in Alfresco.

One of the most useful features of Smart Folders is the ability to automatically classify new files and inherit or map metadata to the file itself. This is possible by using Type-based Smart Folders, so that when you drag and drop files into your Smart Folder structure, they inherit any properties that you have set up in the Smart Folder Template.

Use the tutorial, [Smart Folders tutorial](../tasks/sf-tutorial.md) to set up a Smart Folder framework using Type-based Smart Folders, and in [Adding new claim files](../tasks/sf-tutorial-add.md) you will see metadata inheritance in action.

Take a look at the Metadata Inheritance video to learn more: [Metadata inheritance with Smart Folders](smart-video-04.md)

For more information on Type-based Smart Folders, see [Type-based Smart Folders](sf-folder-type.md).
