# Alfresco sites

An Alfresco site is a area where you can share content and collaborate with other site members.

Any user can create a site. The site creator becomes the Site Manager by default, though additional or alternate managers can be added after this.

Each site has a visibility setting that marks the site as public, moderated, or private. This setting controls who can see the site and how users become site members.

-   **Public site**

    All users can view the content but only site members can work with the content.

    Any user can join the site.

-   **Moderated site**

    All users can access the site but only site members can see and work with the content.

    Users must ask to join the site.

-   **Private site**

    Only site members can access the site.

    Users must be added to the site by a site manager.


The manager of any site—whether public or private—can add users.

**Note:** The visibility setting of a site is displayed next to the site name when you're in the site.

You can remove yourself from a site at any time by clicking ![](../images/settings-icon.png) in the site and selecting **Leave Site**.

-   **[Accessing existing sites](../concepts/site-existing.md)**  
Accessing an existing Alfresco site is easy.
-   **[Site dashboard](../concepts/site-using-2.md)**  
Whenever you enter a site the first thing you see is its dashboard. The site dashboard contains information specific to the current site, and like your user dashboard, site information is organized and displayed in dashlets.
-   **[Managing a site](../concepts/site-build.md)**  
Creating a site is quick and simple. You can then customize it to build a fully functional project site.
-   **[Managing site members](../concepts/members-manage.md)**  
Site users can easily see who else is a member of the site, and site managers can edit user roles and remove a user from the site.
