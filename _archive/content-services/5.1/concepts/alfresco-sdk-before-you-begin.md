# Before you begin

There are some points you need to be aware of before you start using the Alfresco SDK.

Some things to do and note before you start:

1.  Check the [What's New](alfresco-sdk-whats-new.md) page to orientate yourself to the latest features of the SDK.
2.  Check the [compatibility matrix](alfresco-sdk-compatibility.md) to make sure that you have the right version of the SDK for your version of Alfresco.
3.  Make sure that you understand the different types of Maven archetypes that are available. Check the [Maven Archetypes summary](alfresco-sdk-archetypes.md) to make sure that you use the right one for your extension.
