# Test and familiarize after configuring Alfresco

You have successfully installed and configured Alfresco. This information will help you check that the features and customizations you have added are operational.

Tips to help you test your Alfresco customizations:

**Note:** Alfresco recommends that you create one or two test sites for testing purposes and put all your test data in those sites. After finishing the tests, you can delete the test sites in order to clear your database.

-   If you have installed Records Management, test whether you can use it search records in the Alfresco repository. See [Using Records Management](http://docs.alfresco.com/rm2.3/concepts/rm-intro.html).
-   If you have installed and configured the Alfresco Kofax Release script, test whether you can you use it to capture and publish content. See [Installing and configuring Alfresco Kofax Release script](kofax-intro.md).
