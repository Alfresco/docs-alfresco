# Recommendations for split architecture

There are a number of recommendations for splitting the Alfresco architecture in a distributed or clustered environment.

Generally, there are two complementary purposes for distributing or clustering your installation.

-   To achieve redundancy or high availability
-   To provide high-performance and/or throughput

The main decisions are involved around when to split and how to split.

-   **[When to split](../concepts/when-to-split.md)**  
There are a number of indicators to help you decide when to split your architecture from a single node environment to a distributed node environment.
-   **[How to split](../concepts/how-to-split.md)**  
When you have decided to upgrade from a single node environment to a distributed or clustered environment, you must find the most appropriate way to cluster Alfresco's architecture.
