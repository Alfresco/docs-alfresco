# Managing Share features

Use the Admin Tools to manages features of Alfresco Share such as look and feel, tagging, categories, and sites.

-   **[Changing the Share theme](../tasks/admintools-theme.md)**  
The look and feel of the user interface is set by a theme. The Application tool lets you select a color scheme for the user interface.
-   **[Changing the Share logo](../tasks/admintools-logo.md)**  
The Alfresco logo on the top left is at the top left-side. You can change the logo to another image file.
-   **[Using templates](../concepts/templated-nodes-intro.md)**  
With templated nodes and space templates you can store content and folder templates in Alfresco repositories that users can then use to create content.
-   **[Managing tags](../tasks/admintools-tagbrowser.md)**  
Tags can be added to content within the Document Library. Use the Tag Manager page to view, edit, and delete all the tags that have been created by users.
-   **[Managing categories](../tasks/admintools-catmanager.md)**  
Use the Category Manager to add, edit, and delete content categories.
-   **[Managing cloud syncs](../concepts/cloud-sync-manager.md)**  
With Cloud Sync Manager, Alfresco administrators have full visibility of all files and folders that have been synced from their organization to Alfresco Cloud sites, including their original and cloud locations, and the user who synced them.
-   **[Sites Manager](../concepts/network-sites-manage.md)**  
The Sites Manager is used for maintaining Alfresco sites. You have control over the visibility of all Alfresco sites as well as deleting sites or making yourself a site manager.
