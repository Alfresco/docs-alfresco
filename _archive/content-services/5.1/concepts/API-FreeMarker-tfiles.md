# Template files

Template files can be stored on the classpath or within the repository store.

Templates can be stored either on the classpath \(for example, in ./tomcat/shared/classes/alfresco/extension/templates/webscripts\) or in the repository store \(for example, in Repository/Data Dictionary/Web Script Extensions\).

In the case of the web script and Surf frameworks, FreeMarker is always selected as the template engine.
