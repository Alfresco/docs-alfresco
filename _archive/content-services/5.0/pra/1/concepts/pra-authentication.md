# How does an application do work on behalf of a user?

Your must application must authenticate with the Alfresco server to work with Alfresco resources. If your application is using resources on an Alfresco on-premise repository it uses basic HTTP authentication. If your application is using resources on an Alfresco Cloud account it uses OAuth authentication.

-   **[Authentication for Alfresco on-premise](../../../pra/1/concepts/pra-authentication-onpremise.md)**  
 You use HTTP basic access authentication to provide your user name and password to the Alfresco server.
-   **[Authentication for Alfresco Cloud](../../../pra/1/concepts/pra-authentication-cloud.md)**  
 You can register your application with Alfresco to use our authentication.
