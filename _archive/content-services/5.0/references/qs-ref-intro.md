# Reference

This section provides additional information for using the Web Quick Start demo in Share.

Three different sets of sample data are available in the Web Quick Start demo. All examples in this reference material use the **Finance**sample site.

-   **[Templates](../references/qs-ref-templates.md)**  
The Web Quick Start demo includes reusable template pages \(Surf pages\) that can be referenced in Share. A template mapping configured for a section specifies the page layout used for assets stored within that section on the website.
-   **[Breaking down the Web Quick Start site structure](../references/qs-ref-anatomy.md)**  
The content for the Web Quick Start website resides in the Document Library page component of Alfresco Share.
