-   **BPMN 2.0 standard**

    BPMN 2.0 \(Business Process Model and Notation\) is an open standard developed by the Object Management Group \(OMG\) to provide a notation that is easily understandable by all business users: business analysts designing processes, developers implementing technology to perform those processes, and business people managing and monitoring those processes.

    BPMN creates a standardized bridge for the gap between the business process design and process.
