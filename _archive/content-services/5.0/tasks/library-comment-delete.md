# Deleting a comment

You can delete a comment that you created, and site managers can delete any comment.

1.  Find the content \(file or folder\) that you commented on and click on it to open it in the file preview screen.

2.  Click the ![Delete icon](../images/ico-delete.png) Delete Comment icon for the comment you want to delete.

    This icon is available only to the user who created the comment and site managers. The comment list displays the last ten comments added.

    A message prompts you to confirm the deletion of the selected comment.

3.  Click **Delete**.
