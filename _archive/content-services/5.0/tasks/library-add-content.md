# Uploading files

Adding files from your computer to Alfresco is simple. You can upload a single file or several files at a time.

You can add content in two ways: drag and drop files from your computer directly into the library, or click ![Upload icon](../images/upload-icon.png) **Upload**. When you drag and drop a blue outline highlights the selected drop point.

**Tip:** In **Detailed View** you can drag and drop files into the current library level or directly onto a folder. An arrow will be displayed when the files are correctly positioned over the folder to be dropped. In all other views you can drop files into the current library level only. So if you want to drop them into a specific folder, that folder needs to be open in the library view.

**Note:** Internet Explorer 8 and 9 do not support drag and drop functionality. If you are using one of these browsers, you need to click **Upload** to add content.

1.  Select the folder in the document library where you want to add your content.

    When you select a folder in the explorer panel the item list displays the current contents of that folder. When using the **Upload** action the file\(s\) you select will be added here.

2.  Click ![Upload icon](../images/upload-icon.png) **Upload**.

3.  Click **Select files to upload** on the Upload Files dialog box.

4.  Find and select the files that you want to upload from your computer.


The document library displays the uploaded content.

This video show you how to add content to Alfresco.
