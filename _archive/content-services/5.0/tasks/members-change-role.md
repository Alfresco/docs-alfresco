# Changing a site role

A site manager can amend a member or group role to change what they can do in a site.

1.  In a site clickÂ **Site Members**, or **More** then **Site Members** if the site has additional features.

2.  Select **People** or **Groups** in the Members component.

3.  Search for the site member or group whose role you want to change.

    Type a full or partial name, or leave the search box empty to display all members or groups. The results list includes the assigned role.

4.  Click the current role and select a new role from the list.
