# Duplicating a list item

Quickly and easily create a new list item by duplicating an existing item in the same list. This is a particularly useful action if the two items have similar details.

1.  Click on a data list in the Data lists explorer panel.

2.  Position your cursor over the list item you want to duplicate to display the available actions.

3.  Click the ![Duplicate](../images/ico-datalist-duplicate.png) Edit icon.

    The new item is created. Its details are identical to the selected list item.

4.  Edit the new list item as necessary.
