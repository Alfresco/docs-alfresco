# Viewing attachments

When a file has been attached to a record it's easy to view the file in Alfresco where you can make any necessary modifications.

1.  Find a record and scroll down to the **Alfresco Documents** section.

    Any attachments will be displayed here.

2.  Click **View** next to the attachment you want to view.

    The attachment opens in Alfresco where you can see a preview and details of the attachment. The record details are shown in the Properties panel next to the preview. If you have the required permissions you can now use standard Alfresco functionality to work with the attachment, see [Working with content](../concepts/library-intro.md).

    **Note:** If you're not logged into Alfresco you may need to log in before the attachment is shown.


This video shows you how to view attachments.
