# Managing pending invitations

A site manager can view the outstanding invitations. You can revoke an invitation until the recipient accepts or declines it.

1.  In a site clickÂ **Site Members**, or **More** then **Site Members** if the site has additional features.

2.  Select the **Pending Invites** page in the Members component.

    This page lists the users who haven't responded to their site invitation.

3.  Use the search feature if you need to filter the list.

4.  Manage the site invitations using the buttons to the right of each user:

    -   Click **Cancel** to revoke the user's invitation to this site.
    -   Click **Remind** to send the user a reminder by email. Click **Yes** at the prompt to send the email.
5.  You can click **Cancel** to revoke the user's invitation to this site.
