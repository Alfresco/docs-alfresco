# View a file on Google Maps

When a file has geolocation data attached to it you can view the file location on Google Maps directly from Alfresco.

1.  Hover over a file that has the Geolocation Metadata available icon ![Geolocation metadata icon](../images/geographic-icon.png).

2.  Click **More** then **View on Google Maps**.

    The location attached to the file is shown in Google Maps, together with a preview of the file and a summary of the geolocation data.
