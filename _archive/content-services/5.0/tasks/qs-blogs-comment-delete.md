# Deleting a comment

When reviewing flagged comments, you have the option to completely remove a comment from the website.

This task assumes you are in the Data Lists page component of the Quick Start site and the Visitor Feedback list is displayed.

1.  In the Visitor Feedback list, locate a flagged comment.

    A value of **true** in the **Comment has been flagged** column distinguishes a comment as having been reported.

2.  Position your cursor over the comment of interest to display the available actions and click the **Delete** icon in the **Actions** column.

    A message prompts you to confirm the deletion of the selected list item.

3.  Click **Delete**.

    A message indicates the selected list item has been deleted. The related comment no longer appears on the Quick Start website.
