# Editing a comment

You can edit a comment to change what it says.

1.  Find the content \(file or folder\) that you commented on and click on it to open it in the file preview screen.

2.  Click the ![Edit Comment icon](../images/ico-configure.png) edit comment icon for the comment you want to edit.

    This icon is available only to the user who created the comment and site managers. The comment list displays the last ten comments added.

3.  Edit the comment.

4.  Click **Save**.

    The user name and profile picture beside the comment indicate who added it. These details are not replaced with your own if you are editing another user's comment.
