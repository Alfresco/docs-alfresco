# Viewing a topic

The discussion forum topics display in either a summary view or a simple list. Viewing a topic allows you to see the full contents of the discussion.

Although you can perform actions on a topic from the main page, you might want to view the topic before you edit, delete, or reply to it in order to confirm that you have selected the correct one.

1.  In the Discussions feature browse the discussion topics to find the one you want to view.

2.  Click the name of the topic to open it.

    **Note:** Alternately, click **View** to the right of the topic or click **Read** beneath the topic. If the main page displays the simple view, the **Read** action is not available.

    The topic view displays the selected topic in its entirety along with any replies.

3.  Click **Discussions Topic List** to return to the main view.
