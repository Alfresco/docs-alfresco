# Editing files in Google Docs

The **Edit in Google Docs** action is available for any file that can be edited in Google Docs. Common document, presentation, and spreadsheet formats are supported.

Files you edit are temporarily stored in Google Docs, then removed from Google Docs once they've been checked back in to Alfresco.

1.  Hover over file and click **More** then **Edit in Google Docs**.

    If prompted, authorize Alfresco to access your Google Docs account. If you have a Google Username in your Alfresco profile then it will be used as the default account.

    **Tip:** If your browser asks you to allow popups for Google Docs then go ahead and do so. If you're using Safari you won't be able to use Google Docs until you enable all popups in the settings, so for security reasons you may prefer to use a different browser.

    **Note:** If you previously locked the file for editing and are returning to it, you'll have the action **Resume Editing in Google Docs**.

    The file opens in Google Docs in a new browser tab. It's locked in Alfresco so that other users can't edit it while you're working on it. The file stays locked until you either discard or save your changes.

2.  Edit the content.

3.  When you're done, close the Google Docs browser tab.

    In Alfresco you'll see the file displays the ![Geolocation metadata icon](../images/ico-googledocs.png) icon to show that it's open in Google Docs.

4.  In Alfresco, click **More** then **Check In Google Doc**.

    You can also select **Resume Editing in Google Docs** to carry on editing, and **Cancel Editing in Google Docs** to discard the editing session and any changes made.

5.  On the Version Information dialog box, indicate if the revision is major or minor, then add any information that might be relevant to the updates you made.

6.  Click **OK**.

    This saves the file to Alfresco and unlocks the file.

You can share Google Docs files while you are editing them so multiple users can work with a document at the same time.
