# Editing files in Microsoft Office

You can edit Microsoft Office files directly from Alfresco. When you're editing a file it's locked in Alfresco until you finish editing it.

**Important:** If you're working on a Mac then make sure you've updated to the latest minor version number of Microsoft Office. If you have an older version installed then you might have problems opening documents.

1.  Hover over a file and click **More** then **Edit Online**.

    A message asks you to make sure you can trust the content.

2.  Hover over a file in the library and click **More** then **Edit in MS Office**.

    A message asks you to make sure you can trust the content.

3.  Click **OK** to open the file.

    The file opens in a separate window. In Alfresco the file will be shown as locked.

    **Note:** You might get a further request to enter your Alfresco login details and **Enable Editing**.

4.  You can now edit the file.

    The minor version number in Alfresco is updated each time you save the file. All standard Microsoft Office functionality is available.

5.  When you're done, save and close the file.


If **Edit Online** isn't available then check that:

-   You have the site permission to edit the file. Consumers can only view a file.
-   [Your browser is supported](https://www.alfresco.com/services/subscription/supported-platforms)
