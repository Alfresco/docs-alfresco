# Customizing content transformations

This task describes how to customize content transformations.

1.  Download the [content-services-context.xml](http://dev.alfresco.com/resource/AlfrescoOne/5.0/configuration/alfresco/content-services-context.xml)file:

2.  Paste this file into the `<extension>` directory.

3.  Open the file.

    Transformers start below the comment:

    ```
    <!-- Content Transformations -->
    ```

4.  Locate the bean containing a transformer that is most similar to the transformer that you want to add.

    \(It is unlikely that you would want to modify an existing transformer.\)

5.  Delete every pair of `<bean> </bean>` tags except the pair containing the similar transformer.

6.  Rename and modify the bean.

7.  Save the file.

    If you save the file in the `<extension>` directory, the filename must end with â€‘context.xml.
