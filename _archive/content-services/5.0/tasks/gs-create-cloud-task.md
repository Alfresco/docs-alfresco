# Starting a cloud-based workflow

You can start a cloud workflow which generates a workflow task or review in an Alfresco in the cloud site.

**Important:** This option is only available if your Alfresco administrator has enabled the Alfresco cloud sync and hybrid workflow options. The first time you create a cloud-based workflow you might be asked to verify your cloud log in details.

1.  Hover over an item in the library and click **More** then **Start Workflow**.

    **Tip:** You can also start a workflow by clicking **Tasks** on the toolbar, selecting any option then clicking **Start Workflow**. **Start Workflow** is also available on the My Tasks personal dashlet.

2.  Select **New Cloud Task or Review** from the **Workflow** list.

    The appropriate workflow form displays with required fields marked with an asterisk \(\*\).

3.  Enter details for the workflow in the General section.

    1.  In the **Message** field describe the task requirements, such as Please review urgently. This should clearly explain to the user what they are expected to do.

    2.  Leave the **Simple Cloud Task** a Type selected.

    3.  Select a **Due** date for the task.

    4.  Leave the **Priority** set to medium.

4.  Click **Select** to select the network, site, and folder destination for the synchronized content. Only networks that support the Cloud Sync feature can be selected.

5.  Click **Sync**.

6.  Select the user to assign the task generated by the workflow to.

    You can only assign to users in the current network.

    1.  In the Assignee section click **Select** and type the full or partial name of a user.

    2.  Click **Search**.

        Cloud users in your network who match your search are displayed.

    3.  Click the + icon to select a user.

    4.  Click **OK**.

7.  In the After Completion menu select **Delete content on cloud and remove sync**: The content will be removed from the cloud and the sync cancelled.

8.  Select **Lock 'on-premise' copy** to lock the on-premise content being synchronized.

    The lock will remain in place until you unsync the content, meaning that only the cloud version can be edited.

9.  Click **Start Workflow**.

    The workflow task is created. Tasks will appear in the users My Tasks dashlet when they log in to Alfresco in the Cloud.

    Once they set the task as done it will be assigned to you to complete and close.

    In the Document Library content that is part of an active workflow has the ![](../images/ico-workflow.png) icon. Content that has been synced has the ![](../images/ico-synced.png) icon.
