# Searching for a group

The Search feature enables you to locate any user group, regardless of where it exists in the group hierarchy. Once located, you can edit or delete the group.

1.  Click **Admin Tools**, and then click **Groups**.

2.  In the search box, type the full or partial identifier, not display name.

    The search is not case sensitive.

3.  Click **Search**.

    In the results table, click the column headings to sort the results as desired.
