# Viewing synced content in the cloud

After you sync content to the cloud, you can use the **View in Cloud** option to view the content in the cloud site. This can be especially useful if you locked the content on your Enterprise on-premise site.

1.  Hover over a synced file/folder in the library and click **More** then **View in Cloud**.

    **Tip:** Files and folders synced to the cloud display the ![](../images/ico-synced.png) synced icon. Contents of a folder that have been synced display the ![](../images/ico-synced-indirect.png) indirectly synced icon.

    You can also view synced content on the cloud by clicking on the location trail after clicking ![](../images/ico-synced.png) to display the **Sync Info**box.

    The synced cloud site will open, displaying your content.

    **Note:** If you aren't logged into the cloud you'll need to enter your email and password.
