# Creating folders from a template

As well as creating folders from scratch, you can also create folders from templates.

**Note:** Templates are only available if your Alfresco administrator has set some up for you.

1.  Select the folder in the document library where you want to add the folder.

    The item list displays the current contents of the selected folder. The folder you create will be added here.

2.  Click **Create** then **Create folder from template**.

    A list of available templates will be displayed.

3.  Select the template.

    A new folder based on the template is added to the document library. If the template contains content and subfolders these will also be replicated in the new folder.
