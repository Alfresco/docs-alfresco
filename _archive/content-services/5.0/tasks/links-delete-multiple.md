# Deleting multiple links

In the links list you can quickly delete multiple links rather than removing them one at a time.

1.  In the Links feature browse the links to find the ones you want to delete.

2.  In the links list select the links you want to delete:

    -   Click the check box to left of each link you want to delete.
    -   Click **Select** at the top of the list and click **All** to select all links in the current view.
    Click **None** to clear the list selections. Click **Invert Selection** to toggle the check boxes to their opposite state.

    The appropriate check boxes appear selected in the links list.

3.  In the header click **Selected Items** and then **Delete**.

    **Note:** Click **Deselect All** to clear the selected check boxes.

    A message prompts you to confirm the deletion.

4.  Click **Delete**.


A message indicates the selected links have been deleted.
