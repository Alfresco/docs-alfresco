# Following users

There can be many users of a system, so it is likely that there will be some users whose activities will be of more importance to you. You can choose to follow these users so that you can easily keep track of what they've been doing.

1.  Click **Site Dashboard**.

2.  Click the sorting menu on the Site Activities dashlet.

    By default it shows **Everyone's activities**, but you can see that there are other options available including to only show activity from people **I'm following** and to show **My activites**.

    To follow another user you just need to visit their profile. You can do this by clicking on their name in the Site Activities dashlet or by searching for them in the **Members** area of the site. You can see in the Site Members dashlet that no other users have accepted their invitations yet, so you'll need to search for pending users.

3.  Click **People** at the top of the site dashboard.

    This opens the People Finder where you can search for other site members.

4.  Type "a" in the search field and click **Search**.

    All users containing the letter "a" in their name are displayed.

5.  Click the **Follow** button next to a user and you are now following the user.

6.  Click your name at the top of the screen, then **My Profile**.


You'll see that the top of the page shows how many people you're following.
