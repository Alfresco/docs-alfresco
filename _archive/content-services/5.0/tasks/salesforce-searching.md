# Searching by record details in Alfresco

In Alfresco you can find items based on their content or metadata.

If you're using Alfresco for Salesforce then there are additional options to find items based on the details of the record they're attached to.

1.  In Alfresco click ![Advanced Search icon](../images/advanced-search-icon.png) twice in the search field then click **Advanced Search**.

    The Advanced Search page displays.

2.  Choose **CRM Attachments** as the type to look for.

    The options change so that you can search based on Salesforce record names, numbers, or identifiers.

    **Note:** The search is restricted to the current Alfresco network.

3.  Enter your search criteria.

    **Note:** If you searched for the word *ban* then only results for *ban* will be returned, the search won't return results for *banana*. To return matches for a partial word, use a wildcard in your search criteria \(example: *ban\**\).

4.  When you're done click **Save**.
