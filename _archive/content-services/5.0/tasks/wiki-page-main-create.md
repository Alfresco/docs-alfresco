# Creating the wiki main page

When you create a new site, the site's wiki contains a main page, which is empty. You will likely choose to make this the introductory page for the site wiki.

1.  In the wiki click **Main Page** if the main page is not already displayed.

2.  Click **Edit Page**.

3.  Type the content for the main page in the **Text** box.

    Use the features provided to format the text; insert bulleted and numbered lists; change the font color; and insert or edit links, anchors, and images. To assist with editing, use the undo, redo, and remove formatting features as needed. Additional functionality includes the ability to insert and customize tables; insert the current date and time; and view the editor in fullscreen mode. The text box includes other features you might find useful; position the cursor over an icon to display its function.

    The **Insert Library Image** feature displays a list of images in the site library. Click a thumbnail in this list to insert the related image into the wiki page at the current cursor position.

    The **Insert Document Link** feature enables you to insert a link to any piece of content in library of the site you are in. Navigate the library to locate the item you want to link to, then click Add. You can select any number of items. Click **OK** to insert links to the selected items at the current cursor position.

    Click and drag the bottom right corner to resize the text editor.

4.  Optionally, add existing or create new tags for the main page.

    The newly associated tags appear beneath the **Text** box. Click a tag to remove it.

5.  Click **Save**.


The page view displays the main page.
