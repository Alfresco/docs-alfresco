# Applying the Pass-through example

Restart the Alfresco server.

The main differences to notice are:

-   All Active Directory users can point their browser to the Alfresco server and be signed on automatically. \(In Internet Explorer, this requires adding the Alfresco server to the Local Intranet security zone.\)
-   All Active Directory users can access Alfresco as a CIFS file system using their Active Directory credentials.
