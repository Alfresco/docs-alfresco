# Requesting sync

Synced content is updated automatically as it changes. You can also run a manual sync on a single file or folder to ensure changes are transferred to the cloud immediately.

1.  Hover over a synced file/folder in the library and click **More**.

    **Tip:** Files and folders synced to the cloud display the ![](../images/ico-synced.png) icon. Contents of a folder that have been synced display the ![](../images/ico-synced-indirect.png) icon.

2.  Click **Request Sync**.

    The content is synced immediately.
