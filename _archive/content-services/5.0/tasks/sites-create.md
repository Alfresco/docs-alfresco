# Creating a site

You can create a site from anywhere in Alfresco, and are automatically made the manager of the site you create \(a site *can* have multiple managers\).

1.  Open the **Sites** menu on the toolbar and click **Create Site**.

    **Tip:** You can also create a site from your My Sites dashlet: click **Create Site**.

2.  Enter the site details:

    -   **Name**: The title of the site.
    -   **URL Name**: You'll notice that the URL Name is automatically created but you can edit it if you want.
    -   **Description**: Enter a description that will help users know what the site is for.
3.  Select the site visibility:

    -   **Public**: All users can view a public site in their own home network, whether or not they have joined the site. Users who join the site are listed as site members and can work with the site content, depending on their assigned roles.
    -   **Public - Moderated site membership**: The same as a **Public** site but the site manager must approve a users request to join.
    -   **Private**: Only available to the site manager and any users invited to join the site.
4.  Click **OK**.


You'll see the dashboard for the new site which you can now customize. Sites that you create are automatically added to your **Favorites** list.

This video shows you how to create a site in Alfresco.
