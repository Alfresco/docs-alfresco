# Accessing the wiki

Access the wiki to view the wiki content related to the current site. In the wiki you can create, delete, rename, and edit the wiki pages. You can perform most actions from both the wiki list and the page view.

1.  In a site click **More** then **Wiki**.

    **Note:** In each site the feature names can be customized. If the site manager has done this, the link might have a name other than **Wiki**.

    This opens the wiki which displays the main wiki page for this site. When viewing a wiki page the actions you can perform appear as buttons \(**New Page**, **Delete**, **Rename**\) and as links at the top right of the content area \(**View Page**, **Edit Page**, **Details**\).

2.  Click **Wiki Page List** to display the wiki list.

    The wiki list displays a summary of all pages in the wiki for the current site. In this view, the actions you can perform on a wiki page appear as buttons beneath the banner \(only **New Page** is available in this view\) and as links to the right of each page summary. You can perform most actions from both the wiki list and the page view.

    **Note:** You can click **Main Page** to return to the previous view.
