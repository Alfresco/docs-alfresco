# Adding groups to a site

Inviting users one at a time to join your site can be time consuming. To save time you can add entire user groups.

Unlike adding users, an invitation isn't sent to the users in the selected group; the group is added immediately. Groups are created by your Alfresco administrator.

1.  Click ![Invite to Site](../images/invite-to-site-icon.png) in the site you want to invite people to, or click **Invite** in the Site Members dashlet.

    **Tip:** You can also invite people directly from the Members page.

    **Important:** You must be a manager to send invitations.

2.  Click **Groups** and then click **Add Groups**.

3.  Search for and add groups.

    1.  In the Find Groups box, type the full or partial name of the group you want to add.

        You must enter a minimum of one \(1\) character. The search is not case sensitive.

    2.  Click **Search**.

    3.  Click **Add** to the right of the group you want to add.

        The group appears in the Add these Groups box.

4.  In the Add these Groups box, specify a role for the users of each group.

    -   To set the role for a group, click **Select Role** to the right of the group and select a role.
    -   To set the same role for all groups in the list, click **Set All Roles to** at the top of the list and select a role.
    **Note:** You can click **back to Site Groups** to return to the Search for Site Groups page without adding any groups.

5.  Click **Add Groups** to add the groups listed.
