# Day Zero architecture validation

This section describes the steps required to validate the architecture to ensure that it meets the prerequisites for an Alfresco installation.

Check the following steps to validate the architecture:

1.  [Check the supported stacks list for Alfresco](../concepts/supported-stacks.md).

2.  [Validate the architecture](configuration-checklist-arch.md).

3.  [Software requirements settings](../concepts/prereq-install.md).

4.  [Validate the database](../concepts/zeroday-database.md).

5.  [Validate the Operating System](../concepts/zeroday-os.md).

6.  [Validate and tune the JVM](../concepts/zeroday-jvm.md).


-   **[Validating the architecture](../tasks/configuration-checklist-arch.md)**  
There are a number of steps required to validate the architecture to ensure that it meets the prerequisites for an Alfresco installation.
-   **[Software requirements](../concepts/prereq-install.md)**  
The following table lists the required software that must be on your system for manually installing Alfresco.
-   **[Database validation](../concepts/zeroday-database.md)**  
This section describes how to validate your database to ensure that it meets the prerequisites for an Alfresco installation.
-   **[Operating System validation](../concepts/zeroday-os.md)**  
You should ensure that your chosen OS has been officially certified for use with Alfresco.
-   **[Java Virtual Machine validation](../concepts/zeroday-jvm.md)**  
You should ensure that your chosen JDK-enabled Java Virtual Machine has been officially certified for use with Alfresco.
