# Installation

This section of the documentation takes you through getting set up to work with the Alfresco SDK. The Alfresco SDK itself does not need to be installed \(as it is based around Maven\), but there are some pre-requisites that will need to be made available.

This section of the documentation describes how to get ready to use the Alfresco SDK. It takes you through installing the requirements and configuring and validating your installation. Much of the work you need to do can be done on the command line. However, Alfresco SDK does support Rapid Application Development in IDEs such as Eclipse and IntelliJ. These latter topics will be explained in more detail in later sections of the documentation.
