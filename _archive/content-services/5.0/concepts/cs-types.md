# Content store types

By default, Alfresco is configured to save files or content items in the File content store and orphaned files in the Deleted content store. Alfresco also provides other content stores, which may be used in place of or in addition to the default stores. This section gives an overview on the File content store and additional content stores that you can use with Alfresco.

-   **[File content store](../concepts/cs-file.md)**  
This topic describes the File content store, which is Alfresco's default content store.
-   **[Alfresco S3 content store](../concepts/cs-s3connector.md)**  
The Alfresco S3 Connector is an add-on module that provides an alternative content store. It uses Amazon's Simple Storage Service \(S3\) as the storage mechanism for Alfresco, allowing for virtually unlimited and inexpensive storage.
-   **[Caching content store \(CCS\)](../concepts/ccs-home.md)**  
This section provides an overview on Caching content store \(CCS\) and describes how to configure it.
-   **[Aggregating content store](../concepts/cs-aggregating.md)**  
An Aggregating content store \(`AggregatingContentStore`\) is a content store implementation that aggregates a set of stores. This topic provides information on the Aggregating content store and its configuration details.
-   **[Encrypted Content Store](../concepts/encrypted-cs-home.md)**  
Alfresco Version 5.0 includes the Encrypted Content Store subsystem, which provides the ability to encrypt content at rest. This section provides an overview of this subsystem, its components and how it is administered.
