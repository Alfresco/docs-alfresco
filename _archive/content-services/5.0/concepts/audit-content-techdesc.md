# Content auditing technical overview

The data producer `org.alfresco.repo.audit.access.AccessAuditor` gathers together lower events into user recognizable events. For example, the download or preview of content is recorded as a single read. Similarly the upload of a new version of a document is recorded as a single create version. By contrast the `AuditMethodInterceptor` data producer typically would record multiple events.

Default audit filter settings are provided for the `AccessAuditor` data producer, so that internal events are not reported. These settings can be customized \(by setting global properties\) to include or exclude auditing of specific areas of the repository, users or some other value included in the audit data created by `AccessAuditor`.

No additional functionality is provided for the retrieval of persisted audit data, as all data is stored in the standard way, and so is accessible using the `AuditService` search, audit web scripts, and database queries.

The following properties are set by default to discard events where the user is *null* or *"System"*, the content or folder path is under *"/sys:archivedItem"* or under *"/ver:"* or the node type is not *"cm:folder"*, *"cm:content"* or *"st:site"*.
-   **[Audit data generated by AccessAuditor](../concepts/audit-accessauditer.md)**  
Folder and content changes generate the following audit data structure. Elements are omitted if not changed by the transaction.
-   **[Persisted audit data](../concepts/audit-persisted.md)**  
The default audit configuration file alfresco-audit-access.xml only copies the following audit data elements. It also adds `login`, `loginFailure` and `logout` persisted data.
