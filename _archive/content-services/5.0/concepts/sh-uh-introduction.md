# Finding your way around

Alfresco content is stored in sites, and each individual site has its own dashboard made up of *dashlets*.

You also have your own user dashboard which gives you an overview of what's happening in Alfresco, and a user profile which you can use to let others know what you're doing.

-   **[Alfresco toolbar](../concepts/ui-description.md)**  
The Alfresco toolbar is designed to help you to navigate Alfresco and to quickly find, create, and share content.
-   **[User dashboard](../concepts/dashboard-intro.md)**  
Wherever you are in Alfresco, clicking **Home** takes you to your user dashboard. The dashlets on this page give you a simple and up-to-date overview of what's been going on in the sites you're a member of.
-   **[Viewing your user profile](../tasks/profile-view.md)**  
Your user profile includes more information than just your contact details. Here you can see at a glance who you are following, who is following you, the sites you belong to, and the content you have recently added and modified.
-   **[What version of Alfresco am I using?](../tasks/finding-version-number.md)**  
If you need to check which version of Alfresco you're using it's easy to find.
-   **[Subscribing to an RSS feed](../tasks/site-subscribe-rss-feed.md)**  
There are several places in Alfresco where you can subscribe to RSS feeds. These feeds let you automatically receive regular updates on various activities.
