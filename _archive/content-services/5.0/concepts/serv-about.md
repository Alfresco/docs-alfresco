# Alfresco content services

Services address the core use cases for content management applications including the logical organization of content, file management, version control, and security. Services also support the control of content through workflow and process management, and social and collaborative applications.

Alfresco exposes services at various levels including:

-   Java
-   Scripting
-   REST
-   Web services
-   Client interfaces, such as Alfresco Share

Some services are considered internal; others are public. For example, the Java level services are internal. The majority of these are accessible through other public interfaces including the public APIs, client applications, and CMIS.

Alfresco services are divided into two main categories; content application services and content repository services.

-   **[Content repository services](../concepts/serv-repo-about.md)**  
Content repository services are the fundamental services for working with content in Alfresco. Content repository services are written in Java.
-   **[Content application services](../concepts/serv-application-about.md)**  
Content application services extend the repository services, providing extended capabilities for rich content and collaborative applications.
