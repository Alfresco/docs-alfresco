# AMP files

Alfresco Module Packages, known as AMP files, are the recommended way of packaging Alfresco customizations and extensions for deployment. AMPs are zip files that follow a specific layout and can be merged with the other WAR files such as alfresco.war or share.war using the Alfresco Module Management Tool \(MMT\), which is available as alfresco-mmt.jar in the bin directory of your Alfresco installation.

The [Maven Alfresco SDK](alfresco-sdk-intro.md) provides a set of tools for building and deploying AMP files.
