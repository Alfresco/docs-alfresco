# Alfresco power users

Alfresco power users have additional options that aren't available to standard users.

These options are made available when your Alfresco Administrator gives you advanced permissions by signing you up to a power user group.

The current additional options available are:

-   Sites Manager
-   Search Manager

If you have the following permissions you can access the Site Manager through an additional link on the Alfresco toolbar, and the Search Manager from the Search Results screen.

-   Sites Manager is available to users in the `ALFRESCO_ADMINISTRATORS` and `SITES_ADMINISTRATORS` permissions groups.
-   Search Manager is available to users in the `ALFRESCO_ADMINISTRATORS` and `ALFRESCO_SEARCH_ADMINISTRATORS` permissions groups.

Sites Manager is available to users who've been assigned Network Administrator permissions \(speak to Alfresco Support for further details\) on an Alfresco in the Cloud Enterprise Subscription account.

-   **[Sites Manager](../concepts/network-sites-manage.md)**  
The Sites Manager is a great tool for maintaining Alfresco sites. You have control over the visibility of all Alfresco sites as well as deleting sites or making yourself a site manager.
-   **[Search Manager](../concepts/super-search-manager.md)**  
With the Search Manager you can see details of existing search filters and create new filters.
