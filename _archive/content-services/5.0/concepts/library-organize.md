# Organizing content

With different people creating folders and adding files, you want to keep on top of it. Alfresco has multiple features available to help you keep content labelled, organized, and filed correctly.

-   **[Dragging and dropping content](../tasks/library-item-move-dragndrop.md)**  
The drag and drop functionality lets you easily move content around the library.
-   **[Moving content](../tasks/library-item-move.md)**  
You can move content to relocate it to another location within the current library or to a library in a different site.
-   **[Copying content](../tasks/library-item-copy.md)**  
You can copy content between Alfresco locations, within a site or across different sites.
-   **[Renaming content](../tasks/library-item-rename.md)**  
You can quickly rename files and folders.
-   **[Tagging and categorizing content](../tasks/site-content-tag.md)**  
You can tag and categorize similar or related content within a site, making it easy to find the content again.
-   **[Favoriting content](../tasks/library-item-favourites.md)**  
Use the **Favorite** action to mark library content that you access often. This adds the file or folder to the My Favorites view in the explorer panel where you can easily find it.
-   **[Locate items and folders](../tasks/library-locate-content.md)**  
When you filter library content using one of the **Documents** or **Tags** explorer views, it is not possible to tell where a file or folder is within the library folder structure. The **Locate File** and **Locate Folder** actions reveal the actual location of a file or folder in the library.
-   **[Multi-selecting content](../tasks/library-items-multiple-select.md)**  
You can perform a single action on several pieces of content at once. You can select any number of files and folders in the same view.
-   **[Deleting content](../tasks/library-item-delete.md)**  
Delete content to remove it from a site library.
-   **[Recovering deleted content](../tasks/library-item-delete-retrieve.md)**  
If you need to recover content that you've deleted, then it's easy to get it back from your trashcan.
-   **[Emptying your trashcan](../tasks/library-item-delete-final.md)**  
When you delete content, it is moved to your trashcan. By emptying your trashcan you can permanently remove content from Alfresco.
