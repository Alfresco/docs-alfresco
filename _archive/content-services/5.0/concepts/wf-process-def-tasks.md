# Tasks

The integration of Activiti in Alfresco provides three types of tasks in a process definition.

-   **userTask**

    describes work to be done by a human actor. When process execution arrives at a user task, a new task is created in the task list of the user or group assigned to that task.

-   **scriptTask**

    describes an automatic activity. When a process execution arrives at the script task, the corresponding script is executed.

-   **mailTask**

    is similar to a script task, but is specifically set up to send an email.


Tasks are described in detail in the Activiti user guide.
