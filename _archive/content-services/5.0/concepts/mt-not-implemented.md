# Features not supported in a multi-tenant environment

There are some features and components that are not supported in a multi-tenant production environment.

-   Record Management
-   CIFS
-   Portlets
-   LDAP, NTLM and authentication methods other than `alfresco`
-   Inbound email
-   Content replication
-   IMAP
-   Encrypted Content Store
