# Test and familiarize after upgrading Alfresco

You have successfully upgraded Alfresco. The aim of this section is to test and help you gain familiarity and confidence that the core features and functionalities of Alfresco that you intend to use, work as expected.

Here are some of the tips to help you familiarize yourself with Alfresco.

**Note:** Alfresco recommends that you create one or two test sites for testing purpose and put all your test data in those sites. After finishing the tests, you can delete the test sites in order to clear your database.

-   Check if the roles users had in the previous Alfresco version are still valid in the new upgraded Alfresco.
-   Check if your data or document in the previous Alfresco version are available in the new upgraded Alfresco.
