# Admin Console: Directories

The Directories section on the Admin Console contains the page for defining authentication of Alfresco users and groups, including access to external directory services, synchronization and setting up authentication chains.

-   **[Managing authentication directories](../concepts/adminconsole-directorymgt.md)**  
 The Directory Management page on the Admin Console enables you to set up authentication chains, and configure external SSO, CIFS and FTP authentication. In other words, the Directory Management feature gives you the ability to configure and test connections to various directory services.
