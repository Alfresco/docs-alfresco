# Alfresco sites

An Alfresco site is a project area where you can share content and collaborate with other site members.

Any user can create a site. The site creator becomes the Site Manager by default, though additional or alternate managers can be added after this.

Each site has a visibility setting that marks the site as public or private. This setting controls who can see the site and how users become site members.

-   **Public site**

    All users can view the content but only site members can work with the content.

    Any user can join the site.

-   **Moderated public site**

    All users can access the site but only site members can see and work with the content.

    Users must ask to join the site.

-   **Private site**

    Only site members can access the site.

    Users must be invited to join the site.


The manager of any site—whether public or private—can invite users to join.

You can remove yourself from a site at any time.

-   **[Accessing existing sites](../concepts/site-existing.md)**  
Accessing an existing Alfresco site is easy. You can search for sites using the Site Finder, the search box on the Alfresco toolbar, or you might receive an email invitation to a site.
-   **[Site dashboard](../concepts/site-using-2.md)**  
Whenever you enter a site the first thing you see is its dashboard. The site dashboard contains information specific to the current site, and like your user dashboard, site information is organized and displayed in dashlets.
-   **[Managing a site](../concepts/site-build.md)**  
Creating a site is quick and simple. You can then customize it to build a fully functional project site.
-   **[Managing site members](../concepts/members-manage.md)**  
Site users can easily see who else is a member of the site, and site managers can edit user roles, remove a user from the site, and cancel a site invitation.
