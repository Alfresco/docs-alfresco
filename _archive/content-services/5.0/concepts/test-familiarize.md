# Test and familiarize after upgrading and configuring Alfresco

You have successfully upgraded and configured Alfresco. The aim of this section is to make sure that the features and customizations you have added, are operational.

Here are some of the tips to help you test your Alfresco customizations.

**Note:** Alfresco recommends that you create one or two test sites for testing purpose and put all your test data in those sites. After finishing the tests, you can delete the test sites in order to clear your database.

-   Check if the users or groups created previously, still exist.
-   Check if all the dashboards created previously, still exist.
-   Check if the folders in the document library that were created prior to the upgrade, still exist.
