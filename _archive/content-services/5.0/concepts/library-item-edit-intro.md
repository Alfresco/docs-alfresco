# Editing files

There are multiple ways to edit content. These options are available whenever suitable for a file type.

The **Edit Offline** action lets you download a file to your computer so you can edit it there. This locks the file in the library to prevent others from editing it simultaneously. It's available for every file.

The **Edit Online** action lets you edit the file without first saving it offline. It's available only for Microsoft Office 2003 or later files.

The **Inline Edit** action lets you edit plain text, HTML, or XML files directly in the document library. It's available for these file types, which can all be created with the **Create** feature in the library.

The **Edit in MS Office** action lets you edit a Microsoft Office file in the appropriate MS Office program.

The **Edit in Google Docs** action lets you work with files in Google Docs. Like the **Edit Offline** action, this locks the file in the library while it is being edited. It's available for supported document, presentation, and spreadsheet formats.

You can also edit the properties of a file, or upload content as a new version of an existing file.

-   **[Editing files offline](../tasks/library-item-edit-offline.md)**  
When you edit a file offline it's downloaded to your computer and locked in the library, so that other users can't overwrite it while you make changes offline.
-   **[Editing files inline](../tasks/library-item-edit-inline.md)**  
You can edit plain text, HTML, and XML files directly in Alfresco.
-   **[Editing files in Microsoft Office](../tasks/library-item-edit-online.md)**  
You can edit Microsoft Office files directly from Alfresco. When you're editing a file it's locked in Alfresco until you finish editing it.
-   **[Editing files in Google Docs](../tasks/library-edit-content-googledocs.md)**  
The **Edit in Google Docs** action is available for any file that can be edited in Google Docs. Common document, presentation, and spreadsheet formats are supported.
-   **[Editing file and folder properties](../tasks/library-item-edit-metadata.md)**  
Edit the basic details of a folder or file to change its name, description, and tags.
-   **[Uploading new versions](../tasks/library-item-upload.md)**  
You can upload content from your computer to update a file.
