# Managing authentication directories

The Directory Management page on the Admin Console enables you to set up authentication chains, and configure external SSO, CIFS and FTP authentication. In other words, the Directory Management feature gives you the ability to configure and test connections to various directory services. 

The Directory Management page provides an interface for you to:

-   create, configure and manage internal Alfresco directories, OpenLDAP and Active Directory
-   configure authentication chain options for services, such as CIFS and browser SSO
-   test connections to various services before activating them in the authentication chain
-   manage common user synchronization settings
-   easily set up directory services for Alfresco without using property files
