# Alfresco content

A site Document Library is where you store and manage content, such as documents, images, and videos.

You can upload content to share and work on with other site members. Users can view and work on this content, depending upon their permission settings.

Document Library activities appear in the Site Content dashlet so you can see at a glance the content that's been added and updated.

You can also store content in the My Files and Shared Files areas and in the Alfresco Repository, see [Working with content outside the library](library-external.md) for more.

-   **[The Document Library](../tasks/library-access.md)**  
Access the site Document Library to view and work with the content in the current site.
-   **[Building up content](../concepts/library-build.md)**  
You build up site content by creating an organized folder structure then adding content to it.
-   **[Viewing content](../concepts/library-folder-intro.md)**  
To get a closer look at a file or folder without downloading it, you can view it on the file preview screen. This gives you more detail, a preview, and access to social features, actions, and version history.
-   **[Working with content](../concepts/library-items-individual.md)**  
Once files are added to a site, site members can access and work with them. In addition to adding more files, members can view, download, edit, and delete files.
-   **[Applying rules to folders](../concepts/library-folder-rules.md)**  
In the library you can define folder rules to manage your content automatically. You can come up with many creative solutions to make sure specific content processes are automated all without you having to do the work yourself.
-   **[Organizing content](../concepts/library-organize.md)**  
With different people creating folders and adding files, you want to keep on top of it. Alfresco has multiple features available to help you keep content labelled, organized, and filed correctly.
-   **[Using social features](../concepts/library-share-opinion.md)**  
In Alfresco you can use social features to like, favorite, and comment on files and folders.
-   **[Working with files outside the library](../concepts/library-external.md)**  
While the Document Library is the focal point for working with content in Alfresco, there are also a few other areas available to you.
-   **[Working with replicated content](../concepts/replicated-content.md)**  
Alfresco administrators can configure Alfresco so that content is replicated across multiple repositories. Files and folders created as the result of a replication job display the **Transferred from another Repository** icon in the file list.
-   **[Syncing content to Alfresco Cloud](../concepts/cloud-sync-overview.md)**  
The Cloud Sync feature lets you work with your content without you needing access to your Enterprise on-premise system.
