# Operating System validation

You should ensure that your chosen OS has been officially certified for use with Alfresco.

Alfresco is not sensitive to changes to the OS configuration, beyond the impact on I/O performance. For more details, see [Validating the architecture](../tasks/configuration-checklist-arch.md).
