# Alfresco for Salesforce

Alfresco for Salesforce offers document management capabilities to Salesforce CRM users and is accessible from directly within Salesforce.

Using Alfresco for Salesforce sales teams can manage content from within Salesforce, while storing that content in Alfresco. Alfresco enables review and approval processes, passing the content to other employees or third parties as soon as it's uploaded to Salesforce. Features include:

**Full document management support**

-   You can upload, share, edit, and delete files. It also provides version history and tagging capability.
-   Metadata is carried through from Salesforce to Alfresco.

**Access for non-Salesforce users**

-   You can synchronize Salesforce content into Alfresco. This allows non-Salesforce users to access the synchronized content, facilitating secure online collaboration with people outside your organization.

**Automate business processes**

-   You can set up rules in Alfresco that will automatically manage your Salesforce business processes. For example, you could set up rules so that your documents are sent straight to the right people for approval as soon as they're saved in Alfresco. You can then track the progress and completion of the approval process in Alfresco or in the Alfresco Mobile app.

Alfresco for Salesforce is available for [free download](https://appexchange.salesforce.com/listingDetail?listingId=a0N3000000B34XIEAZ) from the Salesforce AppExchange.
