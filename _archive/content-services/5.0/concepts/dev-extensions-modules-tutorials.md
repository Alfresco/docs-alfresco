# Module Tutorials

The following tutorials demonstrate how to create simple modules from scratch. They use Ant-based build scripts to illustrate the concepts of constructing, building and deploying modules. They do not represent a recommended way to develop extensions - they are designed to help you learn more about the construction and layout of modules from first principles.

See [Managing AMP packaging projects](https://artifacts.alfresco.com/nexus/content/repositories/alfresco-docs/alfresco-lifecycle-aggregator/latest/plugins/alfresco-maven-plugin/advanced-usage.html) for more guidance on managing AMPs with Maven.
