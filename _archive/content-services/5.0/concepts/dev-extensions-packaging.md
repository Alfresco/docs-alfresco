# Extension packaging

When you get beyond very simple web scripts to more complex applications, especially where you would like to distribute your extension to a wider audience, you will need to package your extension for convenience. This makes you extension much easier to install.

Some packaging techniques are more suitable while developing your extension, and other package types are better for the day when you want to release your package to a wider community. The [first part](dev-extensions-packaging-techniques.md) of this documentation looks at several packaging options that are available to you. The [second part](dev-extensions-modules-intro.md) focuses on the Alfresco Module Package \(AMP\) system, which is our recommended packaging approach for wider distribution of your extension, and for more complex extensions.

-   **[Packaging options](../concepts/dev-extensions-packaging-techniques.md)**  
There are various ways of packaging Alfresco extensions.
-   **[Modules \(AMPs\)](../concepts/dev-extensions-modules-intro.md)**  
A Module is a collection of code, configuration, scripts and media resources, contained in an AMP file.
