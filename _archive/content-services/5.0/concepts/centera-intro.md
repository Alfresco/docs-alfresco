# Installing and configuring the Alfresco EMC Centera Connector

This topic describes how to install and configure the Alfresco EMC Centera Connector module. It also lists the prequisites for setting up the EMC Centera environment on Windows and Linux platforms.

The Alfresco EMC Centera Connector module addresses the Centera store directly through its native API.

The module uses a series of properties to control the way that you access the store. A feature of this module allows you to set retention policies, such as, preventing content from being deleted for a period of time \(for example, retaining invoices for seven years\).

The Alfresco EMC Centera Connector module can be applied to Alfresco Enterprise 4.2.0 or later.
