# Sharing content externally

Having set up your site and added content to it, you can now use the Cloud Sync feature to collaborate with your external partners.

You will sync your content to the cloud. Your marketing consultants will be able to edit it without having access to your on-premise network, and you can maintain visibility of their edits. When the updates are complete you will unsync the updated content from the cloud.

You will then also create a task that must be completed by a cloud user.

**Note:** The Cloud Sync feature is not available in Alfresco Community.

-   **[Linking your site to the cloud](../tasks/gs-sync-link.md)**  
You can create a link from your Alfresco One site to your cloud account to enable cloud-sync.
-   **[Sharing your content on the cloud](../tasks/gs-sync-sync.md)**  
 You can now sync your content to the cloud, so that your external consultants can make updates to it.
-   **[Removing your content from the cloud](../tasks/gs-sync-unsync.md)**  
 When your external collaborators have completed their work on your content, you can remove the content from the cloud.
-   **[Starting a cloud-based workflow](../tasks/gs-create-cloud-task.md)**  
You can start a cloud workflow which generates a workflow task or review in an Alfresco in the cloud site.
