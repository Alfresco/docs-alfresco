# Developing Extensions

This section of the documentation looks at developing extensions for Alfresco. There are various APIs and approaches that can be used in developing for Alfresco, from constructing small web scripts, to sophisticated extensions.

There are a variety of APIs that can be used to develop your Alfresco extensions. There are also several approaches with regards packaging and deployment of extensions too. Larger extensions tend to be distributed most conveniently as Alfresco Module Packages \(AMPs\), although this is not the only option. Using the [Alfresco SDK](alfresco-sdk-intro.md) is now the recommended approach for developing extensions.

-   **[Web scripts](../concepts/ws-webscripts.md)**  
Web scripts provide a way to write small extensions to Alfresco using JavaScript and FreeMarker.
-   **[Extension packaging](../concepts/dev-extensions-packaging.md)**  
When you get beyond very simple web scripts to more complex applications, especially where you would like to distribute your extension to a wider audience, you will need to package your extension for convenience. This makes you extension much easier to install.
-   **[Alfresco Public Java API](../concepts/java-public-api-list.md)**  
The following alphabetically ordered list of class names is the complete Alfresco Public Java API. Your Java applications should only use methods found in these packages.
