# Viewing content

To get a closer look at a file or folder without downloading it, you can view it on the file preview screen. This gives you more detail, a preview, and access to social features, actions, and version history.

-   **[Viewing folder details](../tasks/library-folder-viewdetails.md)**  
View the details page for a folder to conveniently see all information and actions in one place.
-   **[Viewing a file](../tasks/library-item-view.md)**  
You can preview files by clicking on the thumbnail or name in the document library. All file details and actions are available on this one screen.
-   **[Viewing a file in a browser](../tasks/library-item-view-browser.md)**  
While the preview feature lets you view a file in Alfresco, you also have the option of viewing it in your default browser.
-   **[View a file on Google Maps](../tasks/library-item-view-googlemaps.md)**  
When a file has geolocation data attached to it you can view the file location on Google Maps directly from Alfresco.
