# Personalizing Alfresco

Having installed and signed into Alfresco, the first thing you can do is to personalize Alfresco to your own tastes and needs.

In this section you're going to update your dashboard and your profile.

Your dashboard is made up of dashlets - each dashlet displays summary information on different parts of Alfresco, such as your latest updates, your tasks, or your Alfresco sites. There are two different sets of dashlets available - one set for your personal Alfresco dashboard and one set that is used to customize individual sites that you set up.

As well as adding and removing dashlets you can also customize your dashboard layout.

Managing your profile means that you can create a personality that's visible to other Alfresco users.

-   **[Customizing your dashboard](../tasks/gs-dashboard-setup.md)**  
You can customize your dashboard so that you only see the information that you're interested in.
-   **[Updating your profile](../tasks/gs-publish-credentials.md)**  
Alfresco user profiles help you to identify a user's roles and responsibilities, or even find out who's who in your organization by checking profile pictures.
