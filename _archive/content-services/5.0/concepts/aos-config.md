# Configuring Alfresco Office Services

This information will help you to configure AOS for your environment.

-   **[Setting up Alfresco Office Services using a non-SSL connection](../tasks/aos-config-nonSSL.md)**  
If you are using AOS with a non-SSL connection, you must edit the Windows registry, or run a command at the Mac terminal for every client machine.
-   **[Setting up a global filepath to access Alfresco](../tasks/aos-filepath.md)**  
In Windows Explorer, you can set up a Group Policy to manage Favorites on client machines, or share a .lnk file in your Links folder. This can be useful if you want to preconfigure the folder that users will need to access the Alfresco repository from Microsoft Office \(http://servername:port/alfresco/aos\).
-   **[Configuring mapping properties in Alfresco Office Services](../tasks/aos-props-mapping.md)**  
Property mapping in AOS allows you to inject custom properties and metadata into Office documents. Property mapping is deactivated by default. Follow these instructions to activate property mapping.
