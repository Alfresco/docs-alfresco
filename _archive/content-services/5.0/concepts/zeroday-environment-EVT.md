# Environment validation using EVT

This topic describes how to validate a setup by using the Alfresco EVT.

An Environment Validation Tool \(EVT\) is also available that can validate most of the following requirements. The tool and documentation are available at [https://artifacts.alfresco.com/nexus/content/repositories/alfresco-docs/alfresco-environment-validation/latest/index.html](https://artifacts.alfresco.com/nexus/content/repositories/alfresco-docs/alfresco-environment-validation/latest/index.html). All versions of the EVT are also available on the Alfresco Nexus server at [https://artifacts.alfresco.com/nexus/index.html\#nexus-search;quick~alfresco-environment-validation](https://artifacts.alfresco.com/nexus/index.html#nexus-search;quick~alfresco-environment-validation).

To get a list of the tests that currently run in the latest version of the tool, see the sample report at [https://artifacts.alfresco.com/nexus/content/repositories/alfresco-docs/alfresco-environment-validation/latest/usage.html](https://artifacts.alfresco.com/nexus/content/repositories/alfresco-docs/alfresco-environment-validation/latest/usage.html).
