# Searching in Alfresco

You can use the search box on the Alfresco Toolbar to search for files, sites, and people.

Type your search into the search box, and a list of matching files, sites, and people will be shown as you type.

**Note:** All sites in the network you're currently in are searched, not just the site that you're in. Private sites that you're not a member of and their files aren't shown.

**Tip:** You can type \* to complete a word if you don't know the full word you're searching for. For example, both "*\*resco*" and "*alf\**" will show results for *alfresco*.

The five most relevant files, sites, and people are shown, but you can click **More** to see further results.

**Note:** Wiki pages and blog postings are shown under along with other files. Previews for the following aren't shown, you need to press Enter to search for them:

-   calendar events
-   site-related web links
-   discussion topics
-   data lists and list items

You can either:

-   Click on one of the suggestions to go straight to it, or

-   Press Enter \(with the cursor in the search box\) to view all the files found by your search.


If you press Enter then all the files and folders found by your search are shown. You can now:

-   Click on a result to open it.

-   Click on one or more of the filter options to switch them on and off and narrow down the search results.

-   Hover over a result and click **Actions** and select an option from the menu.

    **Tip:** The main file actions are available here, but you may find more options available when you preview the file.

    You can delete a file this way but the search results won't be updated until you run a new search.


**Note:** Click the **Search in** menu to search in all sites or just in the site you're in.

If you're a [Search Manager](super-search-manager.md) super user then you'll have an additional **Search Manager** option you can click where you can create new search filters.

As well as the search box on the toolbar, there are also additional advanced search features for finding people, sites, and content.

**Tip:** If a file is a Microsoft Office, PDF, or other text-based file type \(not an image or video\) then you can also click ![Advanced Search icon](../images/advanced-search-icon.png) on the file preview to search for text in the file.
