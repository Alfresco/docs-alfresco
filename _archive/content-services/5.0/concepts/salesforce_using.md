# Using Alfresco for Salesforce

With Alfresco for Salesforce you can attach documents to Salesforce records \(accounts, cases, contracts, and opportunities\) and work with them in Alfresco.

Attach a file to a Salesforce record and it's automatically stored in Alfresco. You can then view and edit it in Alfresco as required. The record details are captured as metadata and can also be viewed in Alfresco.

You also have additional advanced search options so that you can search for attachments in Alfresco based on the record that they're attached to.

-   **[Attaching files to records](../tasks/salesforce_attaching_docs.md)**  
You can attach files to opportunities, accounts, cases, or contracts.
-   **[Viewing attachments](../tasks/salesforce_viewing_attachments.md)**
