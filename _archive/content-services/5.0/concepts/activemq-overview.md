# Configuring ActiveMQ

Alfresco uses ActiveMQ for message queuing with various products, for example Alfresco Analytics and Alfresco Media Management.

The standard ActiveMQ installation runs with a basic configuration. You can configure and extend ActiveMQ based on your requirements.

For information about installing ActiveMQ for your specific product, see:

-   [Alfresco Analytics](http://docs.alfresco.com/analytics/tasks/analytics-install-mq.html)
-   [Alfresco Media Management](http://docs.alfresco.com/mm/tasks/mq-auto.html)

For more advanced configuration, such as security, transport connectors, or memory settings, see [Configuring advanced settings for ActiveMQ](activemq-config.md).

-   **[Setting up ActiveMQ](../tasks/activemq-install.md)**  
Set up Apache ActiveMQ to enable message queuing in Alfresco. If you already have an ActiveMQ instance connected to Alfresco, you do not need to perform these step.
-   **[Configuring advanced settings for ActiveMQ](../concepts/activemq-config.md)**  
Some modules require setting up and configuring ActiveMQ to enable high-performance clustering and authentication.
