# Surf View Composition framework

Surf provides a view composition framework.

Surf provides a View Composition framework that lets you define user interface items such as:

-   Pages
-   Templates
-   Regions
-   Components

Â 

-   **[Pages](../tasks/surf-page-view.md)**  
You can define views of pages including specific pages, page formats, and page types.
-   **[Templates and regions](../concepts/surf-templates-regions.md)**  
A template is a reusable layout that you can build once and then apply it to many pages. Each page can then benefit from a common look-and-feel that was pre-prescribed. By changing the template, a web designer can affect many pages all at the same time. This is especially meaningful for large websites where you might need to manage hundreds, if not thousands, of pages.
-   **[Components](../concepts/surf-components.md)**  
Surf lets you bind components to regions. A component usually associates a region with a web script.
