# Setting up Hybrid workflow

Hybrid workflowÂ is an Enterprise only feature for synchronizing workflows between Enterprise on-premise and cloud.

When a workflow is initiated on-premise for a document \(for example, for a task for a review\), this automatically synchronizes to the cloud and triggers a cloud workflow associated with the document. When the cloud process is complete, the workflow then returns to the on-premise workflow.

Hybrid workflow allows you to collaborate with associates and partners without giving access to your Alfresco on-premise behind the firewall. Tasks can be more easily managed and directed by being able to call for explicit actions, rather than simply sharing a document.

To set up and using Hybrid workflow requires:

-   An Alfresco license that includes access to Hybrid workflow
-   Access to an appropriate Cloud network

-   **[Enabling Hybrid workflow](../tasks/hybrid-workflow-enable.md)**  
Hybrid workflow is not enabled by default in an Alfresco installation.
