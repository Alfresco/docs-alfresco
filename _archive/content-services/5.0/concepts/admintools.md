# Using the Share Admin Tools

Share Admin Tools let you manage your administration operations.

Admin Tools enables Alfresco administrators to create and manage users and groups from within Share, set application preferences, manage categories and tags, and browse the system information in the node browser.

**Note:** Some of the tools previously found in Share Admin Tools have been moved to the Repository Administration Console, which is available in Alfresco Enterprise only.

The Admin Tools option is visible on the menu bar only if you are an Administrator user or a user who is a member of the `ALFRESCO_ADMINISTRATORS` group.

-   **[Opening the Share Admin Tools](../tasks/admintools-open.md)**  
You can only see the **Admin Tools** option on the menu bar if you are an administrator user or a user who is a member of the `ALFRESCO_ADMINISTRATORS` group.
-   **[Application settings](../concepts/admintools-prefs.md)**  
Use the Application tool in the **Admin Tools** to set application settings.
-   **[Managing categories](../tasks/admintools-catmanager.md)**  
Use the Category Manager to add, edit, and delete content categories.
-   **[Managing cloud syncs](../concepts/cloud-sync-manager.md)**  
With Cloud Sync Manager, Alfresco administrators have full visibility of all files and folders that have been synced from their organization to Alfresco Cloud sites, including their original and cloud locations, and the user who synced them.
-   **[Using the Node Browser](../tasks/admintools-nodebrowser.md)**  
The Node Browser is a debugging aid that allows you to browse the raw Alfresco repository structure. This is a read-only feature with basic search capability, and is intended for developers responsible for customizing the application.
-   **[Managing tags](../tasks/admintools-tagbrowser.md)**  
Tags can be added to content within the Document Library. Use the Tag Manager page to view, edit, and delete all the tags that have been created by users.
-   **[Sites Manager](../concepts/network-sites-manage.md)**  
The Sites Manager is a great tool for maintaining Alfresco sites. You have control over the visibility of all Alfresco sites as well as deleting sites or making yourself a site manager.
-   **[Managing replication jobs](../concepts/admintools-replication-intro.md)**  
The Replication Jobs tool enables you to create and manage jobs for content replication.
-   **[Managing users](../concepts/admintools-users-intro.md)**  
The Users tool lets you create and manage the user accounts.
-   **[Managing groups](../concepts/admintools-groups-intro.md)**  
The Groups tool lets you create and manage user groups.
