# Process definition deployment

You can deploy a process definition manually or use the Process Designer.

For manual deployment, the Alfresco server must be shut down. Process definitions are deployed when Alfresco starts.

-   **[Deploying a process definition manually](../concepts/wf-deploy-pd-manual.md)**  
You can use the `workflowDeployer` bean to deploy process definitions \(refer to the following code snippet\).
-   **[Deploying a process definition](../tasks/wf-deploy-pd.md)**  
Use the JBoss jBPM Process Designer to save a process definition to a process archive file or to deploy directly to an existing server. Alfresco supports deployment directly to Alfresco.
