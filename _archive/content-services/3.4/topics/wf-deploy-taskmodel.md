# Deploying the task model

This section describes the methods to deploy a task model.

You can deploy a task model in two ways:

-   Using the workflowDeployer bean
-   Deploying as a content model

-   **[Using the workflowDeployer bean](../concepts/wf-using-bean.md)**  
A workflow task model may be deployed using the workflowDeployer bean.
-   **[Deploying as a content model](../concepts/wf-deploy-contentmodel.md)**  
The task model is a content model, so it may be deployed like any other content model.
