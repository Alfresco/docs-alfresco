# What is workflow?

A workflow is a work procedure and workflow steps that represent the activities users must follow in Alfresco to achieve a desired outcome. You can define your own content-oriented workflows. Alfresco provides two different types of workflow: simple workflow and advanced workflow.

## Simple workflow

Simple workflow defines content rules for a space. The content rule dictates how the content entering, leaving, or currently residing in the space is managed. Each workflow definition is restricted to a single state.

## Advanced workflow

Advanced workflow is any workflow constructed using the Alfresco embedded workflow engine. Alfresco includes two out-of-the-box workflows, which are both basic examples of advanced workflows:

-   Adhoc Task \(for assigning a task to a colleague\)
-   Review & Approve \(for setting up review and approval of content\)

In both examples, the content items are attached to the workflow.
