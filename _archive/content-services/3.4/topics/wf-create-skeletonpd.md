# Creating a process definition

The process definition allows you to do the following:

-   Group tasks into task nodes

-   Assign task nodes to people using swimlanes \(example\)

-   Define system actions that can occur during the transition from one task node to the next


-   **[Process definition methods](../concepts/wf-decide-howtopd.md)**  
A process definition can be either an XML file or a process archive. Both of these can be created using jBPM Process Designer. You can also create the XML file manually.
-   **[Creating a skeleton process definition manually](../concepts/wf-create-skeletonpd-manual.md)**  
The high-level parts of the process definition are shown in the Adhoc task example. The complete process definition is shown in the Process definition for an ad hoc task.
