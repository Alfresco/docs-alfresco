# Creating and managing workflows

This section contains steps for creating a workflow process definition and task model.

-   **[What is workflow?](../topics/wf-whatis-workflow.md)**  
A workflow is a work procedure and workflow steps that represent the activities users must follow in Alfresco to achieve a desired outcome. You can define your own content-oriented workflows. Alfresco provides two different types of workflow: simple workflow and advanced workflow.
-   **[Advanced workflow artifacts](../concepts/wf-adv-workflow.md)**  
An Alfresco "advanced" workflow comprises the following artifacts.
-   **[Creating a process definition](../topics/wf-create-skeletonpd.md)**  
The process definition allows you to do the following:
-   **[Setting up JBoss jBPM Process Designer](../topics/wf-prodes-setup.md)**  
This section describes the two ways to set up Process Designer.
-   **[Creating a task model](../tasks/wf-create-taskmodel.md)**  
Perform this task to create a task model, which is similar to a content model.
-   **[Deploying the task model](../topics/wf-deploy-taskmodel.md)**  
This section describes the methods to deploy a task model.
-   **[Adding behavior to a process definition](../concepts/wf-addbehav-skeletonpd.md)**  
You can add behavior to a process definition to describe the data flow, task assignments, and repository actions.
-   **[Configuring UI workflow dialogs](../concepts/wf-configure-uidlgs.md)**  
Dialogs are used in Explorer to present tasks to users.
-   **[Process definition deployment](../topics/wf-intro-deploy-pd.md)**  
You can deploy a process definition manually or use the Process Designer.
