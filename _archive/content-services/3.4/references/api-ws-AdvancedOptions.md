# Advanced options

Advanced options for web scripts.

-   **[Lifecycle](../references/api-ws-lifecycle.md)**  
The `lifecycle` option allows a web script developer to indicate the development status of a web script. Typically, web scripts start out in a draft state while being developed or tested, are promoted to production quality for widespread use, and finally retired at the end of their life.
-   **[Family](../references/api-ws-family.md)**  
The `family` option allows a web script developer to categorize their web scripts. Any value may be assigned to family and any number of families may be assigned to the web script, providing a freeform tagging mechanism. The web script index provides views for navigating web scripts by family.
-   **[Run As](../references/api-ws-runas.md)**  
The `Run As` option allows a web script developer to state that the execution of a web script must run as a particular Alfresco content repository user, regardless of who initiated the web script.
