# WCM roles and tasks

There are four user roles available within Alfresco Web Content Management \(WCM\): Content Manager, Content Publisher, Content Contributor, and Content Reviewer.

When a user is invited to join a web project, the role assigned to the user dictates the functionality available to that user within that specific web project.

Note that the WCM roles are different from the Alfresco roles.
