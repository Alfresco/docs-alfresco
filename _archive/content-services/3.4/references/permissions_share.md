# Permissions

Alfresco uses roles to determine what a user can and cannot do within a Share site. Each role is associated with permissions. The following sections describe the Share user permissions. In general, permissions apply as follows:

-   A site Manager has full rights to all site content â€” what they have created themselves and what other site members have created.
-   Collaborators have full rights to all site content they own; they have rights to edit but not delete content created by other site members.
-   Contributors have full rights to all site content they own; they cannot edit or delete content created by other site members.
-   Consumers have view-only rights in a site: they cannot create their own content.

Site content can be defined as any content created or added to a site. This includes, but is not limited to, Wiki pages, Blog postings, Document Library folders and items, Calendar events, Discussion topics, and comments on any content.

-   **[Dashboards](../references/permissions_share_other.md)**  
The following sections detail the user permissions relating to your Share dashboards \(personal and site\) and their related dashlets.
-   **[Site page components](../references/permissions_share_components.md)**  
The following sections detail the user permissions for each page component.
