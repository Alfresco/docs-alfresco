# Alfresco Repository FreeMarker Template reference

This reference contains the public APIs that compose the Alfresco Repository FreeMarker Template API.

-   **[Template framework architecture](../concepts/APIfreemarker-arch.md)**  
Templates are widespread throughout Alfresco: they are used within the repository core to generate emails and activities, in the Explorer client to build custom views, at the remote REST API layer, and also as the default rendering mechanism for the web script and Surf frameworks.
-   **[Template files](../concepts/APIfreemarker-tfiles.md)**  

-   **[Template models](../concepts/APIfreemarker-models.md)**  
A model consists of a number of objects or hierarchy of objects from which a template file retrieves values that can be used to dynamically generate the output. The model is like the API for the template page: it provides the objects from which properties and values can be accessed.
-   **[People API](../references/APIfreemarker-PeopleAPI.md)**  

-   **[Default Model Methods](../references/APIfreemarker-defaultmodelmethods.md)**  

-   **[Current Date](../references/APIfreemarker-CurrentDate.md)**  

-   **[JSP Page](../concepts/APIfreemarker-JSPpage.md)**
