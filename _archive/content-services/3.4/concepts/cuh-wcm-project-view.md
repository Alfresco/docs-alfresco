# Viewing a web project and its contents

There are various views available within a web project, each view providing a different level of information and allowing a specific set of actions to be performed. The jumping off point for each view is the Web Projects space \(**Company Home** \> **Web Projects**\).

-   **[Viewing the web project details](../tasks/tuh-wcm-project-view-details.md)**  
The Web Project Details page displays the web project properties.
-   **[Displaying the Sandbox view](../tasks/tuh-wcm-project-view-sandbox.md)**  
Each user associated with a web project has their own space, called a sandbox, which contains the existing web project content. Within the sandbox the user manages the content independently from changes made by other users.
-   **[Viewing the sandbox contents](../tasks/tuh-wcm-project-view-contents.md)**  
Within a sandbox, the web project files are organized in folders. The sandbox displays all website or web application content.
