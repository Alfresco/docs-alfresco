# Working with replicated content

Content items and folders created as the result of a replication job display the icon **Transferred from another Repository** in the item list.

This icon indicates that this is replicated, not original, content. Depending on the transfer configuration, the content may be read-only.

Content marked with this icon also displays the action **View in Source Repository**. Select this action to display the details page for the related *original* content item or folder.

**Parent topic:**[The library](../concepts/library-intro.md)
