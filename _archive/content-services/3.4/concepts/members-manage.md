# Managing members

In the Members component the member management tasks are divided across three pages.

The links to these pages appear beneath the site banner. They are:

-   **People**

    This is the default selection and displays the Search for Site Members page. On this page you can search for a particular site member and view a list of all site members. A site manager has access to additional functionality to remove a site member, change a member's role, and invite users to join the site.

-   **Groups**

    The **Groups** link displays the Search for Site Groups page. On this page you can search for a site group and view a list of all groups. A site manager has access to additional functionality to remove a site group, change a group's role, and add groups to the site.

-   **Pending Invites**

    The **Pending Invites** link displays the Manage Pending Invites page. On this page you can view the users that have been invited to join the current site and you can cancel a pending invitation. This page is available only to site managers.


The link of the currently displayed page appears highlighted so you can easily see which page you are viewing.

-   **[Accessing the Members page component](../tasks/members-page-access.md)**  
 Accessing the Members page component enables you to manage the members of any site for which you are a Site Manager.
-   **[Viewing site members](../tasks/members-view.md)**  
The Search for Site Members page enables you to search for a particular site member.
-   **[Viewing site groups](../tasks/members-view-groups.md)**  
The Search for Site Groups page enables you to search for a particular group that has been added to the current site.
-   **[Changing the role of a site member or site group](../tasks/members-change-role.md)**  
A Site Manager can, at any time, change the role assigned to a site member or site group.
-   **[Removing a site member or site group](../tasks/members-remove.md)**  
A Site Manager can, at any time, remove a member or a group from a site. Once removed, the user or group removed no longer has access to the site. If the site is public, an individual user can choose to rejoin the site.
-   **[Viewing and managing the invited users](../tasks/members-view-invited.md)**  
On the Pending Invites page you can view the full list of invited users or search for a particular user. This page enables you to view the users that have been invited to join the current site. When you invite a user to join your site, you can revoke the invitation until it is accepted.
