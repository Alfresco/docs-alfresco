# Working with spaces

The Alfresco panel displays your documents in the same hierarchy of spaces as they exist in the Alfresco repository. The topics in this section describe how to use the Browse Spaces and Documents tab to navigate these spaces, view their contents, create new spaces, and upload a document to a space.

-   **[Browsing spaces](../tasks/MSAddin-browse-spaces.md)**  
The Browse Spaces and Documents tab displays the name of the current space at the top of the pane. Beneath this, you see the subspaces contained in this space, and then a list of all documents and files contained within the current space.
-   **[Creating a new space](../tasks/MSAddin-create-space.md)**  
Create a new space in the Alfresco repository directly from Word.
-   **[Uploading a document to a space](../tasks/MSAddin-upload-doc.md)**  
Upload a saved Word document to any space in the Alfresco repository.
