# Working with comments

Adding comments to a blog post helps make the site blog interactive. While all users with access to the site can view the blog conversations, only site members can add comments.

The number of replies added to a post is recorded and displayed for each posting. You must view a post to add, view, and manage the related comments.

-   **[Adding a comment to a post](../tasks/blog-comment-add.md)**  
 In the Blog page component, you can add a comment to reply to any published blog post.
-   **[Editing a comment](../tasks/blog-comment-edit.md)**  
Edit a blog comment to modify or add to its content. Only a Site Manager, a Site Collaborator, and the user who created the comment can edit it.
-   **[Deleting a comment](../tasks/blog-comment-delete.md)**  
Delete a comment to permanently remove it from a blog post. Only a Site Manager and the user who created the comment can delete it.
