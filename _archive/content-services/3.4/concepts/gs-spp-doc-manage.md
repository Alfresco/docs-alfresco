# Manage a document

Many users will work with documents in the Share repository without ever entering the Share user interface. It is the SharePoint Protocol support built into Alfresco that enables you to do this.

This section of the tutorial walks you through some common SharePoint functionality in Word that you can use for documents stored in the Share repository.

-   **[Create a Document Workspace](../tasks/gs-spp-workspace-create.md)**  
To perform these document management tasks, you need to start with a Document Workspace containing a single document. A Document Workspace is simply a particular type of Alfresco Share site. You can create this within Word.
-   **[Edit a Document Workspace document](../tasks/gs-spp-doc-edit.md)**  
You can open a document stored in a Document Workspace from Word itself. Once open, you display the Document Management task pane, which contains many of the document management features available.
-   **[Work with document versions](../tasks/gs-spp-doc-versions.md)**  
Once you add a document to the Document Workspace, it has version history. You can view and manage the versions from Word.
-   **[Add content to the Document Workspace](../tasks/gs-spp-content-add.md)**  
Letâ€™s presume you require research material for this site. In this step, you create a separate folder in the document library to contain this material and then add a document to the folder.
