# Site links

The links component lets the site members compile a list of web links that are related to the site or that might be of interest to site users. These can be internal links pointing to Share pages or external links pointing to any web address.

The comment feature allows site members to add and manage comments on the site links.

-   **[Accessing the Links page component](../tasks/links-page-access.md)**  
Accessing the Links page component enables you to view the links created for the current site. You can create new links, as well as edit and delete the links that you created. You can add a comment to any link listed.
-   **[Browsing the links](../tasks/links-browse.md)**  
 The browsing feature in the Links page component enables you to filter the links for easier navigation.
-   **[Viewing a link](../tasks/links-view.md)**  
Browsing the links list displays the existing links in the main window of the Links page component. These links display in either a summary view or a simple list. Viewing a link allows you to see the full link details and any related comments.
-   **[Creating a new link](../tasks/links-create.md)**  
Create a new link to associate with the current site. You can add any internal or external web address that you feel may be useful or relevant for users of the site.
-   **[Editing a link](../tasks/links-edit.md)**  
Edit an existing link to modify it. Only a Site Manager, a Site Collaborator, and the user who created the link can edit it.
-   **[Deleting a link](../tasks/links-delete.md)**  
Delete a link to permanently remove it from the Links page component. Deleting a link also deletes all comments associated with it. Only the Site Manager and the user who created the link can delete it.
-   **[Adding a comment to a link](../tasks/links-comment-add.md)**  
In the Links page component, you can add a comment to a link.
