# Presentation content

Presentation content consists of templates, scripts, and XML files that Surf can pick up without a server restart.

Surf consults presentation content when it renders the user interface. Surfâ€™s presentation content consists of three kinds of files:

-   Surf objects
-   Templates
-   Web scripts

-   **[Surf objects](../concepts/surf-objects.md)**  
Surf objects define website parts and describe how they fit together to build the complete web application structure.
-   **[Templates and Surf](../concepts/surf-templates.md)**  
Templates are transformers that generate markup for the browser to render.
-   **[Web scripts and Surf](../concepts/surf-webscripts.md)**  
Surf lets you reuse web scripts and bind them together into unlimited numbers of pages. The scripts are lightweight, making them easy to assemble and deploy.
