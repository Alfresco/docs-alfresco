# Auditing Records Management

Auditing is a requirement of a Records Management system to demonstrate the compliance with the legal and regulatory requirements for managing and controlling electronic and physical records. It is especially important for systems that deal with classified information.

The Audit tool displays the auditing information collected from the system to show whether business rules are being followed and ensure that unauthorized activity can be identified and traced.

The Audit tool maintains a complete trace of all the actions on every record and it cannot be altered.

-   **[Accessing the audit tool](../tasks/rm-audit-access.md)**  
The audit tool displays by default when you access the Management Console.
-   **[Auditing tasks](../tasks/rm-gs-audit-tasks.md)**  
You use the Audit tool user interface to filter the audit log results to display the required details. You can then save the audit log results, either filed as a record, or exported to an HTML file.
