# Alfresco Kofax Release script configuration tabs

The Kofax Release script is configured using three main tabs. The following sections describe each of these and the options available.

-   **[Repository tab](../concepts/kofax-relscript-repotab.md)**  
The Repository tab is used to configure where documents are stored in the Alfresco repository and how existing documents are handled.
-   **[Index tab](../concepts/kofax-relscript-indtab.md)**  
The Index tab defines the Alfresco document type used for released documents, and the mappings between Kofax index fields and Alfresco properties.
-   **[General tab](../concepts/kofax-relscript-gentab.md)**  
The General tab defines the working folder used by Kofax Capture for temporary file storage during the release process.
