# Your personal dashboard

Once you log in to Share you can view information and perform functions on the dashlets that sit on your personal dashboard.

Where a user name, site name, or piece of content appears as a link in a dashlet, you can click it to navigate to the associated page.

Each dashlet includes help text that explains the information presented and how the dashlet can be used. Position your cursor in the dashlet header to reveal the help button, then click it to display the related text. The help remains open until you close it or navigate away from the dashboard.

The topics in this section provide details on using the personal dashlets.

-   **[Entering a site](../tasks/dashboard-site-enter.md)**  
You can enter a site from the My Sites dashlet on your personal dashboard. This dashlet lists all sites that you created or of which you are a member.
-   **[Specifying favorite sites](../tasks/sites-favourites.md)**  
The star to the left of the site name on the My Sites dashlet enables you to mark a site as a favorite. Sites marked as favorites appear in the **My Favorites** list in the **Sites** menu for easy access. You can tag any number of sites this way.
-   **[Configuring the personal dashboard RSS feed](../tasks/dashboard-rss-configure.md)**  
You can configure the Alfresco Global Feed personal dashlet to display any RSS feed on your dashboard.
-   **[Viewing scheduled events](../tasks/dashboard-meetings-view.md)**  
The My Calendar personal dashlet summarizes the scheduled items from all sites with which you are associated. It contains a rolled up view of events that you have created, as well as events for each site you are associated with, either as a member or as the Site Manager.
-   **[Managing site membership requests](../tasks/dashboard-membership-request.md)**  
In addition to displaying upcoming and overdue tasks, the **My Tasks** dashlet enables the Site Manager to manage requests from users to join a public site that has moderated site membership.
-   **[Using the Alfresco Network](../tasks/dashboard-network-use.md)**  
The Alfresco Network personal dashlet displays the most recent Alfresco news and information conveniently on your personal dashboard.
-   **[Configuring the Web View personal dashlet](../tasks/dashboard-configure-webview.md)**  
You can configure the Web View personal dashlet to display any website on your dashboard. View the website within the dashlet or click the dashlet title to open the website in a separate window.
