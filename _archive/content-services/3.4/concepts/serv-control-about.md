# Control services

Control services encapsulate processes through which content flows.

Control services comprise the following:

-   **Workflow** - structured process that includes a sequence of connected steps
-   **Records** - file plans, record types, retention and archival policies, disposition, and reporting, all certified to the DOD 5015.2 standard
-   **Change set** - working area for making safe content modifications
-   **Preview** - viewing content as it should be before publishing
-   **Deployment** - publishing content from one environment to another

-   **[Workflow service](../concepts/serv-workflow-about.md)**  
 Workflow includes structured processes with a sequence of connected steps. Workflow services manage business processes around content using user-assigned tasks, automated steps, and flow control.
-   **[Web Projects service](../concepts/serv-webprojects-about.md)**  
 Web content management applications use web projects to store content related to a web site, web application, and other types of managed web property. The key use case is where multiple artifacts must be managed together through the concept of change sets â€“ collections of related assets that must be managed as a whole.
-   **[Sandbox service](../concepts/serv-sandbox-about.md)**  
 Sandboxes in a web project provide users with an isolated working area in which to make changes to the web content without affecting the view of the data by other users. Workflow is then used to manage a controlled submission process for publishing the changes to the production web property.
-   **[Assets](../concepts/serv-assets-about.md)**  
Assets are the individual items of content being managed within a web project sandbox.
