# Accessing Alfresco Explorer

Use the launch action provided to easily start the Alfresco Explorer application in a new web browser window.

On the My Alfresco tab of the Alfresco panel, click **Launch Alfresco** in the **Actions** list to access Alfresco Explorer.

**Note:** The Microsoft Office Add-In uses Internet Explorer to render the user interface. When an external link is launched in a new browser window, it uses Internet Explorer even if you have a different default browser set in Windows.
