# Managing the Records Management system

The next step in the scenario is to manage the Records Management system.

The Records Management administration features are available in the Management Console. You will only have access to the Management Console if you are a member of the **ALFRESCO\_ADMINISTRATORS** and **Records Management Records Manager** groups. Add your permissions using the **Admin Console**.

The Management Console allows you to manage the Records Management site. You can manage the following Records Management-specific administration tasks, for example:

-   Auditing
-   Creating custom metadata
-   Defining roles
-   Setting email mappings
-   Defining events
-   Creating lists of values
-   Setting relationships
-   Defining user rights report

This tutorial describes the list of values and auditing administrative tasks.

-   **[Accessing the Records Management Console](../tasks/rm-gs-console-access.md)**  
This task assumes that you have access to the Records Management site dashlet and that you are logged in as a user who is a member of the **ALFRESCO\_ADMINISTRATORS** group.
-   **[Managing lists of values](../concepts/rm-gs-lov.md)**  
Throughout the Records Management system, there are metadata entry fields. The metadata can be simple text strings, Boolean values, or dates.
-   **[Auditing Records Management](../concepts/rm-gs-auditing.md)**  
Auditing is a requirement of a Records Management system to demonstrate the compliance with the legal and regulatory requirements for managing and controlling electronic and physical records. It is especially important for systems that deal with classified information.
