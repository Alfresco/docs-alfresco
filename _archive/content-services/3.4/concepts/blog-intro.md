# The blog

The site blog lets you add commentary, descriptions of events, and other material related to your site.

Site members can create, edit, and add comments to blog postings. The postings can be saved as drafts and then, when ready, published to the internal blog. Members can also choose to publish posts to an external blogging site \(WordPress or TypePad\).

-   **[Accessing the Blog page component](../tasks/blog-page-access.md)**  
Accessing the Blog page component enables you to view all published blog posts for the current site. Within the blog, you can create new posts, as well as edit, publish, and delete posts you created. You can also add comments to existing blog posts.
-   **[Browsing the blog](../tasks/blog-browse.md)**  
 The browsing feature in the Blog page component enables you to filter the blog posts. This allows you to more easily navigate the blog content.
-   **[Configuring the external blog](../tasks/blog-configure.md)**  
In addition to creating blog posts and publishing them internally within the site, you can publish the blog posts to an existing WordPress or TypePad blog. To publish the site blogs externally, you must configure the external blog details.
-   **[Viewing a blog post](../tasks/blog-post-view.md)**  
Browsing the blog displays the existing posts in the main window of the Blog page component. These posts display in either a summary view or a simple list. Viewing a post allows you to see the full contents of the post.
-   **[Creating a blog post](../tasks/blog-post-create.md)**  
Create a new blog post to add information or a commentary related to the current site.
-   **[Editing a blog post](../tasks/blog-post-edit.md)**  
Edit an existing blog post to modify or add to its content. Only a Site Manager, a Site Collaborator, and the user who created the blog post can edit it.
-   **[Deleting a blog post](../tasks/blog-post-delete.md)**  
Delete a blog post to permanently remove it from the current site's blog. Deleting a post also deletes all of its comments. Only a Site Manager and the user who created the blog post can delete it.
-   **[Publishing a post to an external blog](../tasks/blog-post-publish-external.md)**  
In addition to publishing a blog post to the site's internal blog, you can publish a post to a configured external blog. To publish a draft post externally, you must also publish it internally.
-   **[Working with comments](../concepts/blog-comment.md)**  
Adding comments to a blog post helps make the site blog interactive. While all users with access to the site can view the blog conversations, only site members can add comments.
