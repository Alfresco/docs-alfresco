# Process definition methods

A process definition can be either an XML file or a process archive. Both of these can be created using jBPM Process Designer. You can also create the XML file manually.

The Process Designer allows you to switch between diagram mode and XML editor mode. This means that you can initially create a file using diagram mode, then switch to editor mode for viewing and fine tuning.

When you redeploy updated process definitions, you can do so manually or using the Process Designer. In either case, the previously deployed process definition is versioned and kept alive to allow existing “in-progress” workflows to continue executing.
