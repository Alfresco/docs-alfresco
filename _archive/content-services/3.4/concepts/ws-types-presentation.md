# Presentation web scripts

Presentation web scripts let you build user interfaces. These include dashlets for Alfresco Explorer or Alfresco Share, portlets for a JSR-168 portal, UI components within Alfresco Surf, websites, or custom applications. They typically render HTML and may include browser-hosted JavaScript.

Unlike data web scripts, presentation web scripts may be hosted in the Alfresco content application server or in a separate presentation server. When hosted separately, presentation web scripts in the presentation server interact with data web scripts in the Alfresco content application server via HTTP.
