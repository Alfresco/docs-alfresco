# Records Management Auditing

The function of the Records Management system is to manage and control electronic and physical records according to legislative and regulatory requirements, and it must be capable of demonstrating this compliance.

The Audit tool displays the auditing information collected from the system to show whether business rules are being followed and ensure that unauthorized activity can be identified and traced. The Audit tool is especially important for systems that deal with classified information.

The Audit tool maintains a complete trace of all the actions on every record and it cannot be altered. The information that is captured and stored includes:

-   any action on any record, any aggregate, or the File Plan
-   user undertaking the action
-   date and time of the action

The Audit tool displays by default when you access the Management Console.
