# Customizing and extending

This section provides developers guidance and reference for customizing and extending Alfresco.

-   **[Alfresco API Reference](../concepts/API-intro-34.md)**  

-   **[Customizing Alfresco Explorer](../concepts/dev-explorer.md)**  
Alfresco Explorer provides a web-based user interface providing document management, collaboration, and administration capabilities.
-   **[Customizing and extending Alfresco Share](../concepts/dev-Share-intro.md)**  
 Alfresco Share provides a rich web-based collaboration environment for managing documents, wiki content, blogs and more. Share leverages the Alfresco repository to provide content services and uses the Alfresco Surf platform to provide the underlying presentation framework.
-   **[Developing against the Alfresco repository](../reuse/gge-hdg-alfrescodevelopment.md)**  
This section provides guidelines and examples for developing against the Alfresco repository.
-   **[Content modeling](../concepts/content-modeling-about.md)**  
Content modeling is a fundamental building block of the Alfresco content repository that provides a foundation for structuring and working with content.
-   **[Building applications with Content Management Interoperability Services \(CMIS\)](../concepts/cmis-about.md)**  
Content Management Interoperability Services \(CMIS\) is an OASIS standard designed for the ECM industry. CMIS enables access to any content management systems that implement CMIS, such as Microsoft SharePoint, IBM FileNet, EMC Documentum, and Alfresco in a standardized and interoperable way.
-   **[Configuring and extending Alfresco services](../concepts/serv-using-about.md)**  
 Services are core to the Alfresco content application server and are used by all applications working against the server. These applications include the Alfresco Explorer and Alfresco Share clients, Virtual File System interfaces such as CIFS, WebDAV, and APIs.
-   **[Working with the Surf framework](../concepts/surf-fwork-intro.md)**  
Surf lets you build user interfaces for web applications using server-side scripts and templates without Java coding, recompilation, or server restarts. Surf follows a content-driven approach, where scripts and templates are simple files on disk so that you can make changes to a live site in a text editor.
-   **[Working with Alfresco web scripts](../concepts/ws-architecture.md)**  
Alfresco web scripts provide a unique way to programmatically interact with the Alfresco content application server. Unlike other interfaces exposed by Alfresco, web scripts offer a RESTful API for the content residing in the content repository. The REST \(Representational State Transfer\) web architecture is based on HTTP requests and responses, URIs \(Uniform Resource Identifiers\), and document types.
-   **[Integrating with other applications](../concepts/integration-options.md)**  
 Alfresco provides different programmatic ways to access the content management capabilities of the system to support use cases where applications need content services. By supporting a number of standards-based protocols, applications and application development environments can use existing tools to access, update, and search content.
-   **[Environment considerations](../concepts/alfresco-considerations.md)**  
While Alfresco can scale from small solutions to enterprise-wide infrastructure, it is best to ensure that Alfresco is configured correctly and the solution is programmed with the most appropriate tools and interfaces when developing a content application.
