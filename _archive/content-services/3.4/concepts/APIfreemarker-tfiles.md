# Template files

Templates can be stored either on the classpath \(for example, in alfresco/config/templates\) or in the repository store.

Each template file will be specific to a particular template engine. The Template Service will pick the appropriate engine based on the file extension. By default, FreeMarker template files will be used. In the case of the web script and Surf frameworks, FreeMarker is always selected as the template engine.
