Use the Criteria tab of the Search page to enter a search query to locate a list of specified records.

|Search criteria|Description|
|---------------|-----------|
|**Insert Field**|A drop down list of search fields. The list of fields assists you when entering the query text. For example, if you select **Disposition \> Disposition Action Name**, the field name `dispositionActionName:` displays in the **Query Text**box. You can then type a disposition action name. For example, `dispositionActionName:cutoff`.|
|**Query Text**|The text field for entering the search query, using the query syntax.|
|**Results options**|The options you can view in the Results tab. The options include the metadata fields, sort order against multiple fields, and custom fields. The **Components** section provides automatic constraints for searches based on record or container type such as record category or folder. There are also constraints for common components such as Cut Off or Frozen items.|
