# My dashboard

Your personal dashboard displays dashlets.

On your dashboard, these are referred to as personal dashlets. Most dashlets summarize and organize information from your Share sites \(the sites that you belong to\) and other pages so that it is available to you in a convenient location.

You can customize your personal dashboard to display the dashlets that interest you. Each one that you select appears as a pane on the dashboard.

When you first access Share the following dashlets appear:

-   **My Sites**

    The My Sites dashlet displays the sites that you belong to. This includes any site that you created yourself. On this dashlet you can mark a site as a favorite, navigate to a site, and create a new site. You an also delete a site if you are a manager of that site. Use the filter beneath the dashlet title to display all of your sites or just your favorite sites.

-   **My Site Activities**

    The My Site Activities dashlet tracks the most recent activities in your sites. Filters let you decide whose activites you see \(everyone's, yours, or other users'\), which type of activities you see \(all, status updates, comments, content, or memberships\), and for what time period. These preferences are saved between sessions. An RSS feed is offered on this dashlet; subscribe to the feed to automatically receive the activity updates.

-   **My Tasks**

    The My Tasks dashlet displays the tasks assigned to you as well as invitations to join sites. There are actions for viewing and editing each task, as well as starting a new workflow. If you have many tasks and want to see them outside the dashlet, click **My Tasks** to jump to the full page view. Use the filter beneath the dashlet title to display only a specific type of task, such as the ones that are overdue or are high priority.

-   **My Documents**

    The My Documents dashlet helps you keep track of your own content in all of your site libraries. Use the filter to show favorite items, items you're editing, or items you've recently worked on. You can choose a simple or detailed view for this dashlet. In the detailed view, you see extra features that let you like an item and mark it as a favorite. You can also jump to a page where you can read and add comments.


Other dashlets are also available:

-   **My Profile**

    The My Profile dashlet shows a summary of your personal details. Click **View Full Profile** to open the Profile page.

-   **My Calendar**

    The My Calendar dashlet displays all of the upcoming events that are scheduled for your sites.

-   **Content I'm Editing**

    The Content I'm Editing dashlet lists the last three library items, blog posts \(drafts, not published posts\), wiki pages, and discussion forum posts that you edited.

-   **My Document Workspaces**

    The My Document Workspaces dashlet displays all Document Workspace sites that you belong to. You can navigate to the Document Workspace sites from this dashlet and also delete the sites if you have the correct permissions.

-   **My Meeting Workspaces**

    The My Meeting Workspaces dashlet displays all Meeting Workspace sites that you belong to. You can navigate to the Meeting Workspace sites from this dashlet and also delete the sites if you have the correct permissions.

-   **RSS Feed**

    By default the RSS Feed dashlet displays the Alfresco website feed. Use the edit action in the dashlet title to change the RSS feed.

-   **Web View**

    The Web View dashlet can be configured to display any website. Use the edit action in the dashlet title to change the website.

-   **Records Management Config**

    The Records Management dashlet displays links for creating, accessing, and configuring the Records Management site. This dashlet is available only when the Records Management module is installed.


Most personal dashlets can be resized. Click and drag the resizing bar on the bottom edge of the dashlet until it is the height you want. This preference is saved between sessions so that each time you return to your dashboard it looks the same as when you last left it.
