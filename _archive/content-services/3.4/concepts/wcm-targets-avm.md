# avm deployment target

The AVM Deployment Target is a target which is registered with the repository-based Deployment Engine. By default its target name is `avm` although this can be changed through configuration. The AVM Deployment Target receives a deployment from an AVM authoring environment and puts the content into an AVM store where it can be used to support a dynamic web site.
