# Editing library content

There are multiple ways to edit document library content. Not every method is available for each content item.

The **Edit Offline** action is available for every content item. Use this to download a working copy of the item to your computer. This locks the item in the library to prevent others from editing the item simultaneously.

The **Inline Edit** action is available only for content items created with the **Create Content** feature in the library. Use this to edit these plain text, HTML, or XML documents directly in the document library.

The **Edit Online** action is available only for Microsoft Office 2003 or greater files. Use this to edit the content item without first saving it offline.

The **Check Out to Google Docs** action is available only for items with the aspect *Google Docs Editable*. Use this to work with items in Google Docs. Like the Edit Offline action, this locks the item in the library while it is being edited.

-   **[Editing an item offline](../tasks/library-item-edit-offline.md)**  
Editing an item offline creates a working copy of the file that is placed in the **I’m Editing** view. While the original item remains in the directory, site members are only able to view and download it. An icon indicates to users that the item is locked. Once checked out to your computer, you can edit the item and then upload the new version.
-   **[Editing an item inline](../tasks/library-item-edit-inline.md)**  
The **Inline Edit** action enables you to edit plain text, HTML, and XML content items that were created using the **Create Content** feature in a site’s document library. This action is also available for content items configured with the aspect *Inline Editable*.
-   **[Editing your Microsoft Office documents online](../tasks/library-item-edit-online.md)**  
The **Edit Online** feature enables you to edit your document without first saving it offline \(checking it out\). An invisible check-out action ensures your document remains protected, or locked, in the Document Library during the editing session. Upon closing the document, the document is invisibly checked in with the updated version available to other users.
