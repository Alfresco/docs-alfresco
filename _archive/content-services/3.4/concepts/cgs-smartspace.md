# Building smart spaces

Define rules within a space to automatically manage the content.

One of the key benefits of Alfresco Explorer is the ability to define rules that affect content within a space. These rules can be used to provide creative solutions to automation and management of content. Rules are applied when content moves in or out of a space and may also apply to content directly in the space or in sub spaces.

A rule is made up of three main elements:

-   The conditions on the content for the rule to match

-   The actions that are performed on the content

-   The type of rule it is


Any number of conditions and actions may be defined in a rule.

-   **[Creating content rules](../tasks/tgs-create-rules.md)**  
In this task you will create content rules within a space.
-   **[Adding a content versioning rule](../tasks/tgs-add-versionrule.md)**  
In this task, you will add a versioning rule for the content using the Create Rule Wizard.
-   **[Adding simple workflow rules](../concepts/cgs-add-workflowrule.md)**  
This topic explains the simple workflow rules you will add to the space.
-   **[Moving content using the clipboard](../tasks/tgs-move-content.md)**  
A sample software overview document is created as part of the template you are using. Use this document to test the rules.
