# The calendar

The site calendar lets you schedule and track events related to the current site.

Site members can create events that appear on the calendar for all site users to see. These events also display in the Site Calendar dashlet.

-   **[Accessing the Calendar page component](../tasks/calendar-page-access.md)**  
Accessing the Calendar page component enables you to view upcoming events for the current site. The calendar defaults to a monthly view.
-   **[Browsing the calendar](../tasks/calendar-page-browse.md)**  
The main view of the Calendar page component defaults to a calendar displaying the current month. The browsing pane to the left provides another calendar for navigating the months without affecting the main view.
-   **[Viewing an event](../tasks/calendar-event-view.md)**  
 The calendar displays only the name provided for a scheduled event, so to view full details you must open the event. Once open, you can edit or delete the event.
-   **[Adding an event](../tasks/calendar-event-add.md)**  
 Any site member can schedule an event that is relevant to the site. Once created, the event appears on the site calendar.
-   **[Editing an event](../tasks/calendar-event-edit.md)**  
To edit a scheduled event, you must locate and then open the event. You can change any event details, including the location, date, and time. You can also add and remove tags associated with the event, and change the Document Library folder associated with the event.
-   **[Deleting an event](../tasks/calendar-event-delete.md)**  
To delete a scheduled event, you must locate and then open the event.
-   **[Browsing the site events](../tasks/calendar-event-browse.md)**  
The **Agenda** view displays all upcoming events scheduled for the current site.
