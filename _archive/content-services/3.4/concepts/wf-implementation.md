# Implementation

This section describes the way that workflow is implemented in Alfresco.

-   Workflows are defined using jPDL process language.

-   You can create process definitions manually in XML files or you can create the definitions graphically using the JBoss jBPM Process Designer. These definitions are automatically saved in XML files.

-   You can specify the content of the workflow task dialogs that will be displayed in the UI.

-   Workflow definitions are easily localizable.

-   Optionally, you can use Process Designer to deploy the process definitions to the Alfresco server in real time.
