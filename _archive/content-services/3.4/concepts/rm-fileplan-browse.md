# Browsing the File Plan

The File Plan consists of a left panel and a content item list.

The left panel shows the following functions:

-   **Navigation**

    A hierarchy of the records.

-   **File Plan**

    A temporary space for records in transition.

-   **Saved Searches**

    A list of searches saved in Records Search.


The structure of the File Plan hierarchy reflects business functions and comprises the following predefined levels:

-   **Record series**

    A record series is container that holds record categories.

-   **Record category**

    The record category contains the retention and disposition instructions for its folders and records.

-   **Record folder**

    A record folder is a space created in a record category, which inherits the attributes of the record category. The record folder is also considered to be under the control of the record category. Once the record folder is created, security restrictions apply. A record folder can be open or closed. A closed record folder cannot accept records for filing.

-   **Record**

    A record is a document under the control of records management, which is filed in a record folder.

-   **Vital record**

    A vital record is considered to be essential to the operation of an organization. A vital record must be reviewed on a periodic basis, which is defined in the review schedule. The review schedule is defined on the record category or folder. Just as record folders appear to exist even though they are really no more than aggregations of records, so higher levels of the File Plan hierarchy seem to exist, though they are no more than aggregations of record folders and/or higher levels.
