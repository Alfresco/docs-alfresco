# Adding content to a web project

Just as in a standard Alfresco space, there are multiple methods of adding and creating content for a web project.

In addition to creating web content within a project, you can upload individual files from your computer and perform a bulk import. To help organize your website or web application content, you can create folders as needed.

-   **[Creating web content](../tasks/tuh-wcm-content-create.md)**  
Within a web project, you can create XML, HTML, and Plain Text web content.
-   **[Uploading content from your computer](../tasks/tuh-wcm-content-upload.md)**  
The basic process for uploading a file from your computer into a web project is the same as when uploading content to a standard Alfresco space.
-   **[Importing content](../tasks/tuh-wcm-content-import.md)**  
Once created, a new web project contains no content. Use the **Bulk Import** feature to quickly import content to populate your web project.
-   **[Creating a folder](../tasks/tuh-wcm-content-createfolder.md)**  
Within a web project, use folders to store and organize your web content. Create the folders within your personal sandbox as you need them.
