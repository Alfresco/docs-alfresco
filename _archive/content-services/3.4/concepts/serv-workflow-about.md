# Workflow service

Workflow includes structured processes with a sequence of connected steps. Workflow services manage business processes around content using user-assigned tasks, automated steps, and flow control.

The workflow engine uses the embedded JBoss jBPM Workflow engine, which is encapsulated within a Workflow service that provides a standard interface to the underlying workflow engine itself. Workflow definitions define process templates, a number of which are provided out of box. You can also define additional process definitions.
