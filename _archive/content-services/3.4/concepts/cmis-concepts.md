# CMIS repository

At the root of the CMIS model and services is a repository, which is an instance of the content management system and its store of metadata, content, and indexes.

The repository is the end point to which all requests are directed. In the RESTful model, it is the root path of the resources being addressed in CMIS. The repository is capable of describing itself and its capabilities.

Other core concepts include:

-   CMIS object model
-   CMIS query
-   CMIS services
