# Adding content to the library

Share provides you with two way to populate the site's document library.

The **Upload** action enables you to upload existing content from your computer into the library.

The **Create Content** menu provides options for creating plain text, HTML, and XML documents directly in the library. It also enables you to create three different types of Google Docs content items: documents, spreadsheets, and presentations.

For both methods, it is important to understand how to create a folder structure within the library to organize the new content items.

-   **[Adding items to the library](../tasks/library-add-content.md)**  
Adding content items from your computer to a site’s document library is a simple process. Share allows you to upload individual files or several files at a time.
-   **[Creating content in the library](../tasks/library-create-content.md)**  
The **Create Content** feature enables you to create text files, HTML files, and XML files directly in a site’s document library.
