# Setting user options

The **User Profile** feature enables you to set various preferences for your view of the application.

From the User Profile and Settings page, you can change your user name, password, and email address; set user interface preferences, including the page displayed when you login; and manage items that have been deleted from the repository.

-   **[Changing your password](../tasks/tuh-options-password.md)**  
Change your password for increased security.
-   **[Editing user details](../tasks/tuh-options-userdetails.md)**  
All users have permissions to change their own name and email address.
-   **[Recovering deleted items](../tasks/tuh-options-recoveritems.md)**  
If you delete a content item in error, you can recover it easily.
-   **[Removing deleted items](../tasks/tuh-options-removeitems.md)**  
Deleted items are still stored in the repository. You may want to permanently remove these items as a housekeeping activity.
-   **[Specifying your preferences](../tasks/tuh-options-preferences.md)**  
The **User Profile** feature enables you to set general preferences for your view of the application.
