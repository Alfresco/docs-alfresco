# Defining roles and capabilities

User permissions are set in Records Management using a combination of roles and capabilities.

A role is a named collection of functional user access. A capability refers to the functions that can be assigned to each user.

A role can be assigned to one or more users; however, a user can be assigned one role only at a time.

-   **[Roles](../concepts/rm-roles-roles.md)**  
The Administrator user has permission to add new roles. The Administrator defines the range of capabilities for each role. Each role can be assigned many capabilities.
-   **[Capabilities](../concepts/rm-roles-cap.md)**  
A capability is an ability that can be granted to a user, which controls the behavior of the system. With respect to the user, this may be to grant a certain operation, or privilege or it may be to alter the behavior of the system for that user.
