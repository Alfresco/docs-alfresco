# Managing content awaiting launch

The **Content Awaiting Launch** list in the Staging Sandbox is a separate staging environment. Submitted and approved content is held here until a specified launch date and time, at which point it will be promoted to the Staging Sandbox as a snapshot.

In the **Actions** list, **Preview Contents** enables users to view the content awaiting launch in the context of the current staging snapshot.

In addition to viewing the content in this staging environment, you can compare current and future versions of the website or web application; override the set launch date and submit the content immediately; and cancel the pending launch altogether.

-   **[Comparing versions](../tasks/tuh-wcm-content-tolaunch-compare.md)**  
The **Visual Comparison** action enables you to do a side-by-side comparison of the version of the web project waiting to be promoted to staging and the current staging snapshot.
-   **[Overriding the launch](../tasks/tuh-wcm-content-tolaunch-now.md)**  
The **Submit Now** action enables you to process the pending launch immediately rather than waiting for the specified launch date and time.
-   **[Cancelling the launch](../tasks/tuh-wcm-content-tolaunch-abort.md)**  
The **Abort Submission** action enables you to cancel the pending launch before the specified launch date and time.
