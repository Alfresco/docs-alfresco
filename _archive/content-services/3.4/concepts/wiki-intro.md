# The Wiki page component

The Wiki page component enables you to create web pages for a collaborative website. Anyone who accesses it can contribute or modify content using a simplified markup language.

When you enter the Wiki page component, the page view displays the wiki main page. Click **Wiki Page List** to display the wiki list.

The wiki page list displays a summary of all pages created for the current site's wiki. A browsing pane on the left side of the page enables you to populate the wiki list with a subset of the wiki content. Selecting a page in the wiki list displays the entire wiki page in the page view.

In both views you can create, delete, view details for, and edit a wiki page. You must be in the page view to rename a wiki page.

-   **[Accessing the Wiki page component](../tasks/wiki-page-access.md)**  
Accessing the Wiki page component gives you access to all wiki content. Within the wiki you can create, delete, rename, and edit the wiki pages. You can perform most actions from both the wiki list and the page view.
-   **[Browsing the wiki pages](../tasks/wiki-browse-pages.md)**  
The browsing pane to the left of the wiki page list enables you to filter the wiki content to make locating specific wiki pages more manageable.
-   **[Creating the wiki main page](../tasks/wiki-page-main-create.md)**  
When you create a new site, the site's wiki contains a main page, which is empty. You will likely choose to make this the introductory page for the site wiki.
-   **[Creating a new wiki page](../tasks/wiki-page-create.md)**  
You can create a new wiki page from both the wiki list and the page view.
-   **[Editing a wiki page](../tasks/wiki-page-edit.md)**  
Edit a wiki page to create new content, edit existing content, and add tags.
-   **[Renaming a wiki page](../tasks/wiki-page-rename.md)**  
You rename a wiki page in the page view.
-   **[Deleting a wiki page](../tasks/wiki-page-delete.md)**  
Delete a wiki page you no longer want to appear in the wiki for the current site. You can perform this task from both the wiki list and the page view.
-   **[Viewing the wiki page details](../tasks/wiki-page-view-details.md)**  
View the details for a wiki page to see the version history, view the tags associated with the page, and list the wiki pages that link to the selected page. You can view the page details from both the wiki list and the page view. On this page, you can view previous versions of the page and even revert to a specific version.
