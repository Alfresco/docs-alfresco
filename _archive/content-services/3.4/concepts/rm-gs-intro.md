# Getting Started with Records Management

The *Getting Started with Records Management* tutorial introduces the basic concepts to accompany the download of the Records Management module for Alfresco. It takes you through a scenario to demonstrate how to store and manage records in the Alfresco Share collaborative environment.Alfresco recommends you walk through this guided tutorial to familiarize yourself with the features.

This tutorial assumes that you have downloaded and installed Alfresco and the Records Management module, and that you are accessing it as an administrator user. The administrator user has permission to access the full functionality of Records Management.

This tutorial also assumes that you have familiarity to Alfresco Share.

-   **[Scenario](../concepts/rm-gs-scenario.md)**  
For this tutorial, you will be walking through the following scenario.
-   **[Log in](../tasks/rm-login.md)**  
Log in to Alfresco Share using the default credentials.
-   **[Designing the File Plan](../tasks/rm-fileplan-design.md)**  
The structure of the File Plan hierarchy reflects business functions and comprises the following predefined levels:
-   **[Preparing disposition schedules](../tasks/rm-gs-disposition.md)**  
The next step in the scenario is to prepare a disposition schedule for the records within a category.
-   **[Filing items to the File Plan](../tasks/rm-gs-fileplan-upload.md)**  
The next step is to file some items into your File Plan structure. When you upload content into Alfresco, you need to specify whether it is stored electronically and is available for you to upload, or whether the item is in non-electronic form and is stored in a physical location.
-   **[Declaring a record](../tasks/rm-gs-undeclared-records.md)**  
When you file an item, Alfresco creates an undeclared record profile but it is not automatically considered to be a record.
-   **[Managing record folders](../tasks/rm-gs-recordfolder-manage.md)**  
You can manage record folders within the File Plan, including viewing the full details, editing the metadata, closing the folder, managing permissions, and viewing the audit log for this folder.
-   **[Managing records](../tasks/rm-gs-records-actions.md)**  
Each level in the File Plan structure provides appropriate actions for the record series, record category, record folder, and records. You can manage records within the File Plan, including viewing the full details, editing the metadata, managing permissions, and viewing the audit log for this record.
-   **[Searching for records](../tasks/rm-gs-search.md)**  
The next step in the scenario is to search for records. The Search records functionality allows you to search the records in the Alfresco repository, and to save the results in a Saved Search area.
-   **[Managing the Records Management system](../concepts/rm-gs-manconsole.md)**  
The next step in the scenario is to manage the Records Management system.
