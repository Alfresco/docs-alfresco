# Working with multiple list items

Select multiple list items in the current data list using the item check boxes in the leftmost column or the **Select** feature at the top of the list. You can select any number of items across multiple pages.
-   **[Performing actions on multiple list items](../tasks/datalists-item-multiple-actions.md)**  
Once you select the list items you want to work with, you can select an action to perform.
