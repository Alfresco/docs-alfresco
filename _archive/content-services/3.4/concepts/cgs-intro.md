# Getting Started with Alfresco Explorer Document Management

The Getting Started with Alfresco Document Management Guide is a tutorial that walks you through the basic concepts of the Alfresco Document Management System.

This Getting Started guide will:

-   Introduce the basic concepts of the Alfresco Document Management solution. It accompanies the download of the system available at: [http://support.alfresco.com/](http://support.alfresco.com/) \(after logging in, click **Online Resources** on the menu bar and then **Downloads**\).

-   Demonstrate how to set up and configure Alfresco for managing your documents.

-   Showcase a Smart Space, which is a collaborative space that uses rules to simplify the handling, management, and transformation of content.

-   Show how to use additional properties and categories to organize and find content.


It is recommended that you download the Alfresco Enterprise 3.4.14 release and walk through this guided product evaluation guide to familiarize yourself with the Document Management features of Alfrescoâ€™s DM platform offering.

-   **[Important notes](../concepts/cgs-important.md)**  
Before proceeding with the tutorial, you must ensure the installation is complete. Documentation is available online for installation assistance and reference.
-   **[Starting with Explorer](../concepts/cgs-starting.md)**  
Take a moment to familiarize yourself with the main page of the application.
-   **[Adding new users](../tasks/tgs-add-user.md)**  
As part of adding the new user, you can define the user's home space. When Alfresco is installed, a User Homes space is created automatically to contain all user home spaces.
-   **[Creating spaces and content](../tasks/tgs-create-spacecontent.md)**  
After adding a new user, you can log in as that user.
-   **[Working with space templates](../tasks/tgs-spacetemplates.md)**  
You can use templates that you create or that are provided to accelerate the setup of a space and to ensure consistency across multiple spaces.
-   **[Building smart spaces](../concepts/cgs-smartspace.md)**  
Define rules within a space to automatically manage the content.
-   **[Collaborating with other users](../tasks/tgs-collaborate.md)**  
To work with other users on this project, you will invite them to a space for collaboration.
-   **[Editing content in a collaborative space](../concepts/cgs-edit-collaborativecontent.md)**  
You can now explore how to edit content in a collaborative space while protecting the content.
-   **[Sending content for review](../tasks/tgs-send-contentreview.md)**  
When content has been completed, it can be sent for review. Any workflow steps that are available for an item of content are shown in its actions, either from the **More Actions** icon or from the **View Details**icon associated with the content item.
-   **[Uploading and transforming content](../tasks/tgs-upload-content.md)**  
Define a transformation rule that converts content as it is uploaded to a space.
-   **[Categorizing content and advanced search](../tasks/tgs-categorize-content.md)**  
Another feature is the ability to assign categories to items. This allows information to be classified in any number of ways. With this, you can retrieve items that match combinations of constraints, including categories. Categories are hierarchical, so searching for an item in a category will also find anything classified below it. In the following example, you are going to add some content to a category and then search for it.
-   **[Forums and discussions](../concepts/cgs-forumsdiscussions.md)**  
This application provides an easy way for people to collaborate using forums and discussions. Forums contain topics of discussion and topics contain posts from different users.
-   **[Summary](../concepts/cgs-summary.md)**
