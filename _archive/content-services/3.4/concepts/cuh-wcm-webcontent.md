# Working with Web Project Content

Once a project has been set up, you can view, add, edit, and manage the web project content.

-   **[Viewing a web project and its contents](../concepts/cuh-wcm-project-view.md)**  
There are various views available within a web project, each view providing a different level of information and allowing a specific set of actions to be performed. The jumping off point for each view is the Web Projects space \(**Company Home** \> **Web Projects**\).
-   **[Adding content to a web project](../concepts/cuh-wcm-content-add.md)**  
Just as in a standard Alfresco space, there are multiple methods of adding and creating content for a web project.
-   **[Maintaining web project content](../concepts/cuh-wcm-content.md)**  
Within a web project, you have your own space, called a *sandbox*, where you can work with your website or web application content.
