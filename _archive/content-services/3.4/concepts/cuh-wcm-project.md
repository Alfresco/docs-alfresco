# Maintaining a web project

To maintain your web project, you can edit the project details, invite members to join the project, and delete user sandboxes. You also have the option of deleting the entire web project.

-   **[Editing the web project settings](../tasks/tuh-wcm-project-edit.md)**  
You edit the web project details in the Edit Web Project Wizard. This wizard allows you to edit the basic web project details, configure the web forms, and configure the web project workflow.
-   **[Inviting users to a web project](../tasks/tuh-wcm-project-inviteusers.md)**  
The Invite Web Project Users feature enables you to add users to an existing web project and assign roles to them.
-   **[Deleting a sandbox from a web project](../tasks/tuh-wcm-project-deletesandbox.md)**  
Deleting a userâ€™s sandbox removes that user and all content contained within the sandbox from the web project. This does not affect the web project as a whole. The delete action cannot be reversed.
-   **[Deleting a web project](../tasks/tuh-wcm-project-delete.md)**  
Deleting a web project is much like deleting any space within Explorer. You can perform this task in the **Web Projects** space. You can also perform this task on the **Details** page or in the Sandbox view of the web project being deleted.
