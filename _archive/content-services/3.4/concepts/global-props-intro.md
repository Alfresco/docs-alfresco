# Global properties file

The global properties alfresco-global.properties file contains the customizations for extending Alfresco.

If you install Alfresco using one of the installation wizards, the alfresco-global.properties file is modified with the settings that you chose during installation. If you install Alfresco using the WAR file, you must modify properties in the sample alfresco-global.properties file manually.

A sample global properties file is supplied with the Alfresco installation. By default, the file contains sample settings for running Alfresco, for example, the location of the content and index data, the database connection properties, the location of third-party software, and database driver, and Hibernate properties.
