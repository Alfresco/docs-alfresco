# Sidebar

The sidebar appears to the left of the working area and can contain one of four features: **Navigator**, **Shelf**, **OpenSearch**, and **Categories**. The sidebar defaults to the **Navigator**.

To change the current sidebar option, click ![Menu](../images/im-menu.png) and select the desired feature.

-   **[Navigator](../concepts/cuh-navigator.md)**  
The **Navigator** enables you to navigate the contents of the Alfresco repository and view them in a tree format without updating the working area as you navigate.
-   **[Shelf](../concepts/cuh-shelf.md)**  
The **Shelf** displays the items in your clipboard. It also provides quick access to content, through shortcuts and the list of recently viewed spaces.
-   **[OpenSearch](../tasks/tuh-opensearch.md)**  
OpenSearch enables you to connect to other available OpenSearch services, such as other Alfresco repositories, to expand your search outside the current repository.
-   **[Categories](../tasks/tuh-categories.md)**  
The **Categories** feature in the sidebar enables you to filter the content items in the repository by a predefined set of categories. Categories are defined by the System Administrator and associated with content items by users.
