# Upgrading an Alfresco runtime

Any Alfresco runtimes in your environment must be upgraded using the same general upgrade process.

This process requires downtime, so to achieve an interruption-free upgrade, configure at least two Alfresco runtimes and upgrade each of them separately \(so that at least one remains online at all times\).
