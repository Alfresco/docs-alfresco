# Roles

The Administrator user has permission to add new roles. The Administrator defines the range of capabilities for each role. Each role can be assigned many capabilities.

Capabilities are not hierarchical, so when the Administrator assigns a capability, it does not grant further capabilities.

Roles for Records Management are:

-   Records Management Administrator
-   Records Management Power User
-   Records Management Records Manager
-   Records Management Security Officer
-   Records Management User
