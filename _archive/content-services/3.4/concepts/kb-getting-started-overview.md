# Building a custom Knowledge Base application

This section provides an example of how to build a custom Knowledge Base application in Alfresco.

There are three main parts:

1.  **Getting started** describes the foundation work for building a Knowledge Base application, including designing and implementing the content model and content rules required to implement a lifecycle for Knowledge Base articles.
2.  **Customizing Alfresco Share \(basic\)** describes how to extend Alfresco Share by implementing custom dashlets, pages, and site presets.
3.  **Customizing Alfresco Share \(advanced\)** describes how to extend Alfresco with additional customizations, including custom forms and workflows.

**Note:** These instructions include sample code and assume that you are adding the sample files in a location referred to as <installLocation\>. Path references use a Windows file convention. If you are using a non-Windows system, such as a Linux distribution, adjust the file paths accordingly.

**Important:** Before installing any code, you must stop the Alfresco server.

-   **[Getting started](../concepts/kb-about.md)**  
This section focuses on the Alfresco repository and Alfresco Explorer and walks through the design and implementation of the required content model and rules to implement a lifecycle for Knowledge Base articles.
-   **[Customizing Alfresco Share \(basic\)](../concepts/kb-share-customize-about.md)**  
This section demonstrates how to extend Alfresco Share to implement custom dashlets and pages. It walks through the configuration of each of these into an Alfresco Share project site and looks at how to define new site presets and make them available to your users.
-   **[Customizing Alfresco Share \(advanced\)](../concepts/kb-share-customize-adv.md)**  
This section guides you through the process of adding advanced customizations to Alfresco Share and the Alfresco repository. These customizations include the addition of archiving logic based on the Alfresco repository rules, and customizing the Alfresco Share interface by introducing new actions and workflows to the document library, and introducing custom forms.
