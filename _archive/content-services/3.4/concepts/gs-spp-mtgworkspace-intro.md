# Collaborate with colleagues around a meeting

To easily manage content related to a specific meeting, create a Meeting Workspace in Share when you create a meeting request in Microsoft Outlook.

Like a Document Workspace, a Meeting Workspace is simply a particular type of Share site. Here you can post an agenda and manage materials associated with the meeting, such as documents, presentations, and discussions. Use this site to prepare for the meeting, record details of the meeting, and then share and follow-up on the results of the meeting.

-   **[Create a Meeting Workspace](../tasks/gs-spp-mtgworkspace-create.md)**  
You can create a Meeting Workspace in Share at the time you create a meeting request. The existing Share users that you add as meeting attendees automatically become members of the Meeting Workspace. The user who creates the Meeting Workspace automatically becomes the site manager.
-   **[View the Meeting Workspace](../tasks/gs-spp-mtgworkspace-view.md)**  
Once a meeting connected to a Meeting Workspace exists on your calendar, you can access that workspace directly from Outlook.
-   **[Edit the meeting attendees](../tasks/gs-spp-mtgworkspace-edit.md)**  
In Outlook, you can easily change the users invited to a meeting and then send an update. When a meeting is associated with a Meeting Workspace, changing the users automatically updates the members of the related workspace in Share.
