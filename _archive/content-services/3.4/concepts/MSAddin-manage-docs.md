# Managing documents

Once a document exists in the repository, there are a number of Alfresco Explorer functions available to you within Word. Each function exists in the Alfresco panel as an action that you can perform against your open Word document.

-   **[Checking out a document](../tasks/MSAddin-checkout-doc.md)**  
When editing content, you can check out a content item to prevent other users from overwriting your work.
-   **[Modifying documents](../tasks/MSAddin-modify-docs.md)**  
You edit both checked in and checked out repository documents in the same way.
-   **[Viewing document details](../tasks/MSAddin-doc-details.md)**  
The **Document Details** tab displays information on the document currently open in Word. The information available includes the document metadata, tags associated with the document, and the version history.
-   **[Tagging a document](../tasks/MSAddin-tag-docs.md)**  
Create tags to categorize your document content. This enables you to easily locate the content again.
-   **[Making a document versionable](../tasks/MSAddin-version.md)**  
Enable versioning for a document to track the revisions made to it.
-   **[Checking in a document](../tasks/MSAddin-checkin-doc.md)**  
Once you complete your edits on a checked out document, you must check in the working copy to update the original in the repository.
-   **[Transforming a document to PDF](../tasks/MSAddin-transform-doc.md)**  
You can easily transform a Word document in the Alfresco repository into Adobe PDF format.
-   **[Inserting a file into the current document](../tasks/MSAddin-insert-file.md)**  
Use the **Insert File** action to insert the contents of a Word document from the repository directly into the currently open Word document.
-   **[Starting a new workflow against a document](../tasks/MSAddin-start-workflow.md)**  
Use the workflow feature to attach workflow directly to a document and then assign the document to another user for review. Two preconfigured workflows are available: Adhoc Task \(for assigning a task to a colleague\) and Review & Approve \(for setting up review and approval of content\). The workflow tasks are managed on the My Tasks tab.
-   **[Deleting a document](../tasks/MSAddin-delete-doc.md)**  
Delete a document to permanently remove it from the repository.
-   **[Managing your document tasks](../tasks/MSAddin-manage-tasks.md)**  
Use the My Tasks tab to view and manage the tasks assigned to you.
-   **[Viewing document tags](../tasks/MSAddin-view-tags.md)**  
Viewing tags enables you to filter the repository contents to make locating specific documents more manageable.
