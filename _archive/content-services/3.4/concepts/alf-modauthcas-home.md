# Using Alfresco with CAS authentication through Apache `mod_auth_cas`

This section provides an overview on how to install and use Alfresco on a Red Hat Enterprise Linux server that uses aÂ Central Authentication Service \(CAS\) server as a Single Sign-On \(SSO\) solution.

**Note:** CAS 3.3.5 is the only version that has been confirmed to work with this configuration of Alfresco. CAS 3.4.3.1 requires changes to this configuration.
