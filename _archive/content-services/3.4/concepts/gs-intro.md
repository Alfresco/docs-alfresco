# Getting Started with Alfresco Share Collaboration

In today’s workplace, individuals spend most of their time working on teams. To collaborate effectively, they need tools to facilitate communication, share information, and run projects. Alfresco Share provides these tools.

The *Getting Started with Alfresco Share Collaboration* tutorial introduces the basic concepts to accompany the download of Alfresco Share. It takes you through a scenario to demonstrate the flexibility Alfresco Share provides for working in a collaborative team environment.

Alfresco recommends you walk through this guided tutorial to familiarize yourself with the features.

-   **[Scenario](../concepts/gs-scenario.md)**  
For this tutorial, you will be walking through the following scenario.
-   **[Log in](../tasks/gs-login.md)**  
Log in to Alfresco Share using the default credentials.
-   **[Create your collaboration site](../tasks/gs-site-create.md)**  
The next step in the scenario is to create a collaboration site for your team.
-   **[Prepare your site for collaboration](../concepts/gs-site-prepare.md)**  
To make the new site as collaborative as possible, you should prepare it before inviting users.
-   **[Invite members to your site](../tasks/gs-members-invite.md)**  
After you have set up your collaborative site, you can invite people to join it.
-   **[View activities within your site](../concepts/gs-activities-view.md)**  
Now that you have prepared your site and invited your users, you can return to the site dashboard and see the specific activities that occurred and documents that were modified within the site.
-   **[Use SharePoint Protocol \(SPP\) Support with your MS Office documents](../concepts/gs-spp-support.md)**  
If you are familiar with editing your Microsoft™ Office documents using SharePoint, Alfresco enables you to work with the same interface, using Alfresco Share as your repository instead of SharePoint.
