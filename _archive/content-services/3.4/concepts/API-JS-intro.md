# Alfresco Repository JavaScript API

The Alfresco Repository JavaScript API lets you develop JavaScript \(ECMAScript\) 1.6 compatible files to access, modify, and create Alfresco repository objects such as nodes, aspects, and properties.

The Alfresco JavaScript API is relevant for JavaScript files that execute in the Alfresco web client and for web scripts that execute JavaScript within the repository.

You can use scripts to perform the following functions:

-   Find nodes
-   Perform searches
-   Walk node hierarchies
-   Modify the value of properties, aspects, and associations
-   Transform and manipulate content
-   Process WCM web projects and AVM objects
-   Create groups, people, and modify permissions
-   Create new files, folders, or nodes
-   Copy, move, and delete nodes
-   Create, modify, and remove child and target associations between nodes
-   Include \(or import\) other scripts

-   **[About script files](../concepts/API-JS-Scripts.md)**  
Script files are generally located either on the classpath \(for example, alfresco/extension/myscripts\), or in a repository store \(for example, the default repository in Company Home/Data Dictionary/Scripts\)
-   **[Scripting API](../references/API-JS-Scripting-API.md)**  
The Alfresco JavaScript API provides a rich set of scriptable Java objects.
-   **[Services API](../references/API-JS-Services.md)**
