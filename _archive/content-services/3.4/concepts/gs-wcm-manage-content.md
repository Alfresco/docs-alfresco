# Manage web project content

At this point, your web project is populated with content items, some imported and some created, some submitted and some not. You must now deal with the approval of content items that were routed through workflow and the submission of the remaining items to staging.

-   **[Approve content](../tasks/gs-wcm-approve-content.md)**  
With all of your web project content created, you can now address the items assigned for editorial review as part of the defined workflow.
-   **[Submit content](../tasks/gs-wcm-submit-content.md)**  
With the website content now complete, we need to confirm how these changes will look within the website. To do this, you promote the content items from your user sandbox to the Staging Sandbox.
