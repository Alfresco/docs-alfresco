# Installing and configuring Alfresco WCM

Alfresco Web Content Management \(WCM\) is the leading open source solution.

Alfresco Web Content Management provides:

-   An Open Source, lower cost, and lower risk solution that offers greater control and visibility over current and future costs
-   A full ECM suite providing complete control over any content from within a single integrated platform â€“ documents, images, video, audio, etc.
-   A complete collaboration environment for creating, approving and publishing content to the web
-   A platform built on industry standard technology that is as simple to use as a shared network drive

The Alfresco repository supports two store implementations for WCM:

-   Web Quick Start \(WQS\)
-   Alternative Versioning Model \(AVM\)

-   **[Web Quick Start](../concepts/WQS-intro.md)**  
Web Quick Start is an easy-to-install package that provides developers with a strong starting point for their Alfresco implementations.
-   **[Alfresco Web Editor](../concepts/awe-intro.md)**  
The Alfresco Web Editor is a Spring Surf-based web application that provides in-context editing capabilities for Alfresco repository content. The editor provides a mechanism for non-technical users to make edits to Alfresco content directly within a web page.
-   **[Alternative Versioning Model \(AVM\)](../concepts/wcm-admin-intro.md)**  
This section describes the installation, configuration, and deployment procedures for the Alfresco WCM functionality using the Alternative Versioning Model \(AVM\).
