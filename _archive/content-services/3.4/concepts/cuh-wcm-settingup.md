# Setting up a Web Project

To set up an Alfresco web project, you must set up web forms and a web project.

-   **[Creating a web form](../tasks/tuh-wcm-webform-create.md)**  
A web form is a form created by a web developer for use in web projects. The web form is used by a Content Contributor to capture content and store it as XML content in the repository.
-   **[Creating a web project](../tasks/tuh-wcm-project-create.md)**  
You create a web project using the **Create Web Project Wizard**. The wizard automates the creation of a source repository, called a *Staging Sandbox*, and a set of development repositories, called *user sandboxes*. The number of user sandboxes created corresponds to the number of users invited to work on the web project.
