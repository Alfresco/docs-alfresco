# Using Records Management

Records management is a process for the systematic management of information recorded on all media, including both physical and electronic records. It encompasses the whole life cycle of information, from creation through to final disposal. It is based on the principles of regular review, and controlled retention or destruction. The general aim is to ensure cost-effective business processes, legal and regulatory compliance, and good practice.

A record is information that is created, received, and maintained as evidence by an organization or person, in pursuance of legal obligations, or in the transaction of business. The definition of a record is often identified strongly with a document; however, a record can be either a tangible object or digital information that has value to an organization. Examples of records include birth certificates, medical x-rays, office documents, tax returns, audited accounts, and email.

The other crucial aspect of records and records management is their veracity for use as evidence. Records management can be seen as being primarily concerned with the identification and management of the evidence of an organization's business activities.

Electronic records management systems can reduce the burden of managing records, making them easier to file, search, use, and eventually destroy. This is the purpose of the Alfresco Records Management module.

-   **[Getting started](../concepts/rm-gettingstarted.md)**  
This section enables you to familiarize yourself with the Records Management site dashboard. You can visit these components at any time to update, edit, or reconfigure the Records Management environment.
-   **[The File Plan component](../concepts/rm-fileplan.md)**  
The File Plan is a container for the records management hierarchy that uses a pre-determined classification structure. The navigation panel contains a navigation hierarchy showing the hierarchical structure.
-   **[File Plan structure](../concepts/rm-fileplanstruct-create.md)**  
Each user is given a role that may or may not grant them permission to create the File Plan structure. You can file records and create the structure within the File Plan level in which you have permission.
-   **[Managing the File Plan](../concepts/rm-fileplan-manage.md)**  
Each level in the File Plan structure provides appropriate actions for the record series, record category, record folder, and records. These actions allow you to manage the metadata, move, copy, and delete.
-   **[Disposition schedules](../concepts/rm-dispschedule.md)**  
Disposition schedules are a key function of the records management system. The disposition schedule defines the procedures required for maintaining records in the records management system until their eventual destruction or transfer to another location.
-   **[Searching records](../concepts/rm-search.md)**  
The Records Search functionality allows you to search the records in the Alfresco repository, and to save the results in a Saved Search area. You can search for categories, series, and folders separately.
-   **[Administering Records Management](../concepts/rm-admin-intro.md)**  
The administrator can manage Alfresco Records Management from the Management Console.
