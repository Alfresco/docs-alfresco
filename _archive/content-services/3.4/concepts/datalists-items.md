# Working with list items

Once you create a list you must populate it with the desired list items.

You can add items to both your own lists and lists created by other site members. Do this by creating new items or duplicating existing list items.

To maintain your lists you can also edit and delete items.

-   **[Creating a list item](../tasks/datalists-item-create.md)**  
Create list items to populate an existing data list.
-   **[Editing a list item](../tasks/datalists-item-edit.md)**  
Edit an existing list item to modify it. Only a Site Manager, a Site Collaborator, and the user who created the item can edit it.
-   **[Duplicating a list item](../tasks/datalists-item-duplicate.md)**  
To quickly and easily create a new list item, you can duplicate any existing item in the same list. This is a particularly useful action if the two items have similar details.
-   **[Deleting a list item](../tasks/datalists-item-delete.md)**  
Delete a list item to permanently remove it from the current data list. Only the Site Manager and the user who created the item can delete it.
