# Configuring Alfresco Explorer extensions

Alfresco Explorer provides a useful interface for content contributors, letting them use it to create new Knowledge Base articles and adjust metadata properties using automatically rendered property sheets. Alfresco Explorer features a number of configurable options for working with your Knowledge Base spaces and articles.

These include:

-   Property sheets
-   Wizards and icons
-   Smart spaces
-   Space templates



-   **[Property sheets](../tasks/kb-prop-sheets-config.md)**  
Alfresco Explorer automatically renders content metadata for viewing and editing. It generates a property sheet for content in applications, such as a Knowledge Base, that you can tweak by informing Alfresco Explorer of properties that exist on the `kb:status` and `kb:article` aspects.
-   **[Wizards and icons](../tasks/kb-icons-config.md)**  
Alfresco Explorer features a number of configurable wizards to which you can plug in your Knowledge Base assets.
-   **[Smart spaces and scripting](../concepts/kb-smart-spaces-about.md)**  
Using rules and scripting let you wire custom business logic into a space in the Alfresco repository without the need for any Java code, compilers, or server restarts.
-   **[Space templates](../concepts/kb-space-templates-about.md)**  
Using content types, rules, and server-side JavaScript, you can implement a wide variety of custom workspaces. You may have elaborate folder structures or a complex chain of rules established. You may have set up permissions and groups exactly according to the needs of your project or task. An easy way to capture and reuse that work is using space templates.
