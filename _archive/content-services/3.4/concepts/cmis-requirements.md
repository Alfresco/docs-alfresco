# CMIS requirements

CMIS uses web protocols to access the repositories and supports SOAP and REST through the AtomPub protocol.

**Note:** Atom Publishing Protocol, or AtomPub, is an IETF standard for creating and updating web resources. It is REST-based and very flexible in extending the metadata it handles. This protocol is the basis for REST-based APIs.

CMIS focuses on mapping to existing systems targeting core use cases, such as:

-   **Collaborative content creation** - allows users to work collaboratively to create one or more documents or web pages
-   **Portal access of ECM systems** - portals with CMIS provide an aggregated interface to viewing content from multiple sources
-   **Mashups of content in websites** - websites using CMIS can create composite applications that mash up or integrate data and functionality from one or more repositories
-   **Portable search against multiple repositories** - search interfaces in CMIS support a consistent way for search engines to index and access content from a content repository
