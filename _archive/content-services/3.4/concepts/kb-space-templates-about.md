# Space templates

Using content types, rules, and server-side JavaScript, you can implement a wide variety of custom workspaces. You may have elaborate folder structures or a complex chain of rules established. You may have set up permissions and groups exactly according to the needs of your project or task. An easy way to capture and reuse that work is using space templates.

You can apply a space template to any location in the repository and stamp out an exact copy of your entire preconfigured workspace. This includes:

-   The entire folder structure of your project
-   The rules on the folders in your project
-   The permissions on the folders in your project
-   The server-side JavaScript or FreeMarker templates you configured for the folders of your project
-   Any sample content you placed in the folders of your project

You will build your Knowledge Base space as a space template to quickly stamp out Knowledge Base spaces.
