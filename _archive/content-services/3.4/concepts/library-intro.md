# The library

The site library lets you store and collaboratively manage the content related to a site, such as documents, media files, and graphics.

Site members can create and upload content for all site users to see and work on. Activities performed by site members display in the Recently Modified Documents site dashlet.

-   **[Accessing the Document Library page component](../tasks/library-access.md)**  
Accessing the Document Library page component enables you to view all content items for the current site. Within the library, you can view, upload, edit, and delete items. You can also add comments to an item and edit its metadata.
-   **[Browsing the library](../tasks/library-browse.md)**  
The browsing feature in the Document Library page component enables you to filter the items displayed in the item list. This allows you to more easily navigate the library contents.
-   **[Creating a folder structure](../tasks/library-create-folder.md)**  
The **Library** section of the browsing pane displays the folder structure for the current site. A new site contains only the root folder, **Documents**. Add new folders beneath the root to create the site’s folder structure.
-   **[Adding content to the library](../concepts/library-add-content-intro.md)**  
Share provides you with two way to populate the site's document library.
-   **[Working with folders](../concepts/library-folder-intro.md)**  
Once the document library structure has been set up, site members can access and work with the folders that organize the library content. In the content item list, clicking a folder name or thumbnail displays the contents of that folder. From this list, site members can also choose to view the folder details and edit the properties defined for a folder.
-   **[Working with individual library items](../concepts/library-items-individual.md)**  
Once the document library is populated with content items, site members can access and work with individual items stored in the library. In addition to adding more content, members can view, download, edit, and delete content items.
-   **[Specifying favorites](../tasks/library-item-favourites.md)**  
The star to the left of a folder or content item in the Document Library item list enables you to mark it as a favorite. Folders and items marked as favorites appear in the **My Favorites** view for easy access. The items, but not folders, also appear on the My Documents dashlet on the personal dashboard beneath the **Favorites** filter. You can tag any number of folders and items as favorites.
-   **[Editing folder or item details](../tasks/library-item-edit-details.md)**  
Edit the basic details of a library folder or content item to rename it, edit its associated tags, and add or change the description. If the aspect *Classifiable* is configured for the selected folder or item, you also have the ability to edit the associated categories.
-   **[Editing folder or item metadata](../tasks/library-item-edit-metadata.md)**  
From the details page, you can edit the metadata of the currently displayed folder or content item. The fields displayed on this page vary depending on how the metadata has been customized.
-   **[Using comments](../concepts/library-comments.md)**  
Adding comments to folders and individual library items is a convenient way to provide site users with information or notes specific to that content. While all users with access to the site can view the comments, only site members can add comments. You can edit and delete any comments that you added.
-   **[Locating items and folders](../tasks/library-locate-content.md)**  
When you filter library content using one of the browsing views provided, such as the **I'm Editing** or **My Favorites** view, it is not possible to tell where in the folder structure an item or folder resides. The **Locate File** and **Locate Folder** actions enable you to reveal the actual location of an item or folder in the library.
-   **[Copying content](../tasks/library-item-copy.md)**  
You can copy an entire folder or an individual item to another site within Share or to any space in the Alfresco Explorer repository. The selected content remains in its original location and a copy is placed in the destination folder \(Share\) or space \(Explorer\) specified.
-   **[Moving content](../tasks/library-item-move.md)**  
Move content to relocate it to another location within the current site. You cannot relocate content to a different site or a location outside Share.
-   **[Managing content permissions](../tasks/library-item-permissions.md)**  
There are four roles, or groups, available to categorize Share users: Manager, Collaborator, Contributor, and Consumer. Share allows you to manage permissions for library items by changing a group's default permissions for a folder \(and its content\), an individual content item, or a group of content items.
-   **[Deleting content](../tasks/library-item-delete.md)**  
Delete content to permanently remove it from a site’s library. Deleting a folder removes both the folder and its contents from the library.
-   **[Working with replicated content](../concepts/replicated-content.md)**  
Content items and folders created as the result of a replication job display the icon **Transferred from another Repository** in the item list.
-   **[Working with multiple library items](../concepts/library-items-multiple.md)**  
Share provides several methods for selecting multiple items. Doing this lets you perform a single task on multiple items in the library.
