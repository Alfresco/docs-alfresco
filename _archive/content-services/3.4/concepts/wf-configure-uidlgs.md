# Configuring UI workflow dialogs

Dialogs are used in Explorer to present tasks to users.

You can modify default dialogs to:

-   Control which task properties display.

-   Control which task properties are read-only and mandatory.

-   Control how each task property is rendered in the dialog.

-   Present a custom dialog for each kind of task in the workflow.


Alfresco Explorer already provides a sophisticated configuration mechanism for controlling dialogs. This same mechanism extends to workflow tasks.
