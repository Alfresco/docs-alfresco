# File Plan structure

Each user is given a role that may or may not grant them permission to create the File Plan structure. You can file records and create the structure within the File Plan level in which you have permission.

-   Users with the Create, Modify, Destroy File Plan metadata capability are allowed to create record series and record categories. This capability is typically granted to Records Managers and Administrators of the system.
-   Users with the Create, Modify, Destroy Folders capability are allowed to create record folders. This capability is often given to power users, local records officers, and so on. These users are allowed to create and manage record folders, and also records, within a specified part of the File Plan.

The structure levels, record series, record categories, and record folders, are known as aggregation objects. An aggregation object is a space in which you can put a collection of other objects.

When you create an aggregation object, the system records the date of creation and the user creating the object. This information is recorded in the object's metadata. Depending on the aggregation object being created, the system may mandate certain other metadata. Record categories, for example, carry the most metadata, as they carry the disposition instructions for the whole category.

-   **[Adding a new record series](../tasks/rm-recordseries-add.md)**  

-   **[Adding a new record category](../tasks/rm-recordcategory-add.md)**  

-   **[Adding a record folder](../tasks/rm-recordfolder-add.md)**  

-   **[Adding items to the File Plan](../tasks/rm-fileplan-additems.md)**  
This task assumes you are in the File Plan page of the Records Management site.
-   **[Editing record metadata](../tasks/rm-metadata-edit.md)**  
Before you can declare a record, you must enter details about the record in the metadata. The metadata is extracted and required when the document is filed.
-   **[Declaring a record](../tasks/rm-record-declare.md)**  
Documents are not automatically considered to be a record. An uploaded document is not considered to be part of the Records Management system until it has been declared as a record.
