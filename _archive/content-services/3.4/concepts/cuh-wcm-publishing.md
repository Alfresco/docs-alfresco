# Publishing a Web Project

Once the web content is complete and has been promoted to the Staging Sandbox, you can publish the web project to the production environment. Once published, you still have the option to revert to a previous version of the project, if necessary.

-   **[Deploying a snapshot](../tasks/tuh-wcm-deploy.md)**  
You deploy a snapshot in the Staging Sandbox to publish it to the production environment.
-   **[Rolling back to a previous snapshot](../tasks/tuh-wcm-revert-snapshot.md)**  
The Revert action in the Staging Sandbox enables you to roll back to a previous snapshot. This creates a new snapshot of that version, which becomes the current staging snapshot.
