# Working with multiple library items

Share provides several methods for selecting multiple items. Doing this lets you perform a single task on multiple items in the library.

-   **[Selecting multiple items](../tasks/library-items-multiple-select.md)**  
Select multiple items in the current view using the item check boxes to the left of each item thumbnail or the **Select** feature at the top of the item list. You can select items, folders, or a combination of the two.
-   **[Performing actions on multiple items and folders](../tasks/library-items-multiple-actions.md)**  
Once you select the library items and/or folders you want to work with, you can select an action to perform.

**Parent topic:**[The library](../concepts/library-intro.md)
