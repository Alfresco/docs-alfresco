# Using CMIS with Alfresco

The Alfresco CMIS implementation is the basis for many CMIS applications. Most applications that use CMIS with Alfresco use the AtomPub protocol rather than the SOAP protocol; however, some applications with a strong web services framework use SOAP.

If you are programming CMIS applications in Java, you can use the Apache Abdera libraries that were built to handle AtomPub. Abdera provides both client and server implementations of the Atom Publish and Subscribe protocols. To use CMIS with PHP, use one of the PHP web frameworks.

Use CMIS for building applications or application integrations against Alfresco to make the application portable to other systems; however, use web scripts to:

-   Use or query aspects or access properties in aspects
-   Add or manage workflows
-   Apply actions or rules
-   Perform any records management operations
-   Work with web content management
-   Perform any management or administrative task such as user or group management, or indexing control

You can also integrate web scripts with the AtomPub protocol of CMIS.
