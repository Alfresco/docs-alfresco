# DocLib Portlets capabilities

The Share DocLib Portlets include most of the functionality available in a standard Share Document Library.

The following Document Library features are not available in DocLib Portlets:

-   The **View in Alfresco Explorer** action is not available for folders.
-   When viewing the Details page for a folder or content item, the **Share** section does not display.
-   User names do not link to the related Profile page.

As the Share header does not display in the DocLib Portlet, the following framework functionality is not available:

-   **Share toolbar:**

    My Dashboard, My Profile, Sites menu, People Finder, Search, Help, Logout

-   **Other page components:**

    Wiki, Blog, Calendar, Links, Discussions, Data Lists

-   **Site dashboard:**

    Invite, Customize Dashboard, Edit Site Details, Customize Site, Leave Site


Refer to the Document Library page component section of the Share User Help for full details of the functionality available.
