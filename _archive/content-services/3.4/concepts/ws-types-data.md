# Data web scripts

Data web scripts encapsulate access and modification of content/data held in the content repository; therefore, they are provided and exposed only by the Alfresco content application server.

Data web scripts provide a server interface for client applications to query, retrieve, update, and perform processes, typically using request and response formats such as XML and JSON.
