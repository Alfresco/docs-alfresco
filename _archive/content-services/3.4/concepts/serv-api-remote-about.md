# Using Remote APIs

Remote APIs allow clients connecting from a separate tier to communicate with the Alfresco content application server. Remote APIs are based on web services and RESTful and CMIS protocols, and are language agnostic, allowing you to develop against these APIs using a range of languages including Java, PHP, Ruby, and .NET.

There are several Remote APIs available, including:

-   **Web services** - object-oriented API using SOAP and supporting a range of content services including authentication, query, node creation and update, access control, and actions
-   **RESTful** - HTTP-based resource oriented interfaces used by the Surf framework and Alfresco Share
-   **CMIS** - a standard that defines web services and REST-based bindings for working with CMIS compliant repositories

-   **[Using the RESTful API to retrieve document tags](../tasks/api-tags-retrieve.md)**  
 This is a simple example of using a Remote API to retrieve a list of tags for a document.
