# Customize the Document Workspace

Once the Document Workspace exists, you can manage the site directly from Word.

You can:

-   Edit the site name
-   Customize the site

When you create a Document Workspace from Word, the URL name is generated automatically from the name provided for the site. Once created, you cannot edit the URL name. In this tutorial, both the site name and URL name are **SPP**.

-   **[Edit the site name](../tasks/gs-spp-editsite-name.md)**  
Ensure the document spp-tutorial.docx is open on your computer. The Document Management task pane is open in the document window with the site name, SPP, displayed at the top. This is the name you will edit.
-   **[Change the site settings](../tasks/gs-spp-editsite-settings.md)**  
In Share, there are seven page components available for a site: Wiki, Blog, Document Library, Calendar, Links, Discussions, and Data Lists. By default, when you create a Document Workspace from Word, the site includes only the Document Library and Links components. From Word, you can easily access the Share page for customizing the site. Again, you will work from the document spp-tutorial.docx.
