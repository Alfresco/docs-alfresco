# Selecting articles for the landing page

You use asset collections—collections of web assets—to populate the Quick Start website pages with the desired content from the Quick Start site in Share. The two types of asset collections, static and dynamic, enable you to manually select the desired web assets or automatically generate assets from a query run on a configured interval.

Refer to the following topics to explore editing a static asset collection \(**featured.articles**\) to select articles for the News page and editing a dynamic asset collection \(**section.articles**\) to populate the links in the More News sidebar of the News landing page.

-   **[Configuring a static asset collection](../tasks/qs-configure-static.md)**  
Edit a static asset collection to manually select the web assets to be used by that collection. You can add and remove assets from an existing collection.
-   **[Configuring a dynamic asset collection](../tasks/qs-configure-dynamic.md)**  
There are several configurations that you can make when editing a dynamic asset collection. Edit the query to change the location from which the web assets are being retrieved or to exclude an asset from being selected. You can also change the maximum number of assets to be retrieved and the interval at which the query run.
