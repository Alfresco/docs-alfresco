# Collaboration services

Collaboration services integrate the production and publishing of content into social networks.

These comprise:

-   **Social graph**: represents people and their relationship to each other, either directly or indirectly through groups or teams
-   **Activities**: continuous personalized feed of activities performed by others in the social graph or by Alfresco
-   **Wiki**: easy creation and editing of interlinked web pages
-   **Blog**: log of regularly maintained entries of commentary, events, and other material, such as documents and videos
-   **Discussions**: threaded conversations

-   **[Sites service](../concepts/serv-sites-about.md)**  
Sites are a key concept within Alfresco Share for managing documents, wiki pages, blog posts, discussions, and other collaborative content relating to teams, projects, communities of interest, and other types of collaborative sites.
-   **[Invite service](../concepts/serv-invite-about.md)**  
The Invite service maintains user and group memberships for sites.
-   **[Activity service](../concepts/serv-activity-about.md)**  
Alfresco Share uses activities to track a range of changes, updates, events, and actions, allowing users to be aware of of details of the changes.
-   **[Tagging service](../concepts/serv-tagging-about.md)**  
Tags are keywords or terms assigned to a piece of information including documents, blogs, wiki pages, and calendar events.
-   **[Commenting service](../concepts/serv-commenting-about.md)**  
 Comments are modeled as separate content items that are associated with the relevant node through child associations. The Commenting service provides a RESTful API for working with comments.
