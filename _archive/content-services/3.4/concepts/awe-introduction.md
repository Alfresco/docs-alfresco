# Alfresco Web Editor

Alfresco Web Editor provides in-context editing functionality for content obtained from an Alfresco repository. This enables you to edit Alfresco content directly in the web page in which it is being viewed.

**Note:** You can use the **Search topics** button to narrow the search scope to just this topic, or to this topic and its subtopics.

-   Click the **Search topics** button ![Search Topics icon](../topics/../images/e_quick_search_multi.gif) in the **Contents** toolbar.
-   Select **Search selected topic** or **Search selected topic and all subtopics** from the menu. A search window appears.
-   Enter your search query in the search window and click **OK**. The search results are listed in the **Search Results** view.

In a web browser that has JavaScript enabled, a ribbon displays the application toolbar, which is always visible, and the Web Editor toolbar.

With JavaScript disabled, the Web Editor in-context editing functionality is still available in the web page but no ribbon is displayed. In this case, either an icon \(CSS enabled\) or text marker \(CSS disabled\) indicates the editable content on the web page.

The application toolbar contains the following features:

-   **Orientation**

    Enables you to position the ribbon in the browser; select from the options **Top**, **Left**, and **Right**

-   **Help**

    Displays online help specific to the current tab

-   **Logout**

    Logs you out of the Alfresco repository
