# The discussions forum

The discussion forum lets you post user-generated content related to a site. These topics often take the form of questions or comments with threaded discussions.

Members of a site can create new topics and can also reply to a posting to take part in a discussion on a specific topic.

-   **[Accessing the Discussions page component](../tasks/discussions-page-access.md)**  
Accessing the Discussions page component enables you to view the discussion topics for the current site. Within a discussion, you can create new topics, as well as edit and delete topics you created. You can also reply to existing topics to take part in the discussion.
-   **[Browsing the topics](../tasks/discussions-topics-browse.md)**  
 The browsing feature in the Discussions page component enables you to filter the discussion topics. This allows you to more easily navigate the content.
-   **[Viewing a topic](../tasks/discussions-topic-view.md)**  
Browsing the discussion forum displays the existing topics in the main window of the Discussions page component. These topics display in either a summary view or a simple list. Viewing a topic allows you to see the full contents of the discussion.
-   **[Creating a new topic](../tasks/discussions-topic-create.md)**  
Create a new topic to start a discussion relevant to the current site with the site members.
-   **[Editing a topic](../tasks/discussions-topic-edit.md)**  
Edit an existing discussion topic to modify or add to the content. Only a Site Manager, a Site Collaborator, and the user who created the topic can edit it.
-   **[Deleting a topic](../tasks/discussions-topic-delete.md)**  
Delete a topic to permanently remove it from the Discussions page component. Deleting a topic also deletes all of its replies. Only the Site Manager and the user who created the topic can delete it.
-   **[Creating a reply](../tasks/discussions-topic-reply.md)**  
Creating a reply enables you to begin or take part in a discussion related to the site. You can reply to the original discussion topic or any replies already created for that topic. Each reply is nested to visually indicate the discussion flow.
