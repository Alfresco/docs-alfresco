# Features not supported in this release

This version of Alfresco does not currently support all SharePoint features.

The following features are not supported:

-   Alert me about this document
-   Tasks
-   Custom metadata
-   Publish Back to Source Location
-   Create Document Workspace from Alfresco Share Collaboration Site
-   Sub sites
-   Options

    **Note:** Microsoft Office 2010 onwards doesn't include a Document Management panel for working with the Alfresco repository from Microsoft Office, but you can still use the online editing feature in Alfresco. You can reopen documents stored in Alfresco by clicking **File** then **Recent** in a Microsoft Office program and selecting the document.
