# Working area

The working area is a dynamic area displaying items relevant to the selected space and the task you are performing.

In the Company Home, My Home, and Guest Home spaces, the working area contains a space header, the Browse Spaces pane, and the Content Items pane. In these panes, the actions that can be performed are displayed in menus and as clickable icons. If you are not sure which action an icon performs, position your mouse over the icon to display a helpful label.

When you select **My Alfresco** in the navigator, the working area displays your personal dashboard. See [My Alfresco Dashboard](cuh-dashboard.md) for full details.
