# Working with visitor feedback

Visitors to the Quick Start website are able to provide feedback in two ways: by commenting on a blog post and by submitting a form on the Contact page. All visitor feedback received from these two sources is captured in the Data Lists page component of the Quick Start Share site where it can be managed.

In addition to capturing the Contact page visitor feedback in a data list, the submission of this website form triggers a simple workflow in the Share site, enabling a designated user \(the administrative user by default\) to track and address the communication.

-   **[Managing comments on blog posts](../tasks/qs-blogs-manage.md)**  
When a visitor to the Quick Start website posts a comment on a blog article, that comment is displayed on the website for all to see. If any website visitor finds the posted comment to be inappropriate or offensive, they have the option of reporting the post.
-   **[Responding to Contact page submissions](../tasks/qs-contact-respond.md)**  
To easily track comments and queries originating from the Contact page, submission of this form on the website triggers a simple workflow in Share. This results in the creation of a task that appears in the My Tasks dashlet on the personal dashboard. By default, the task is assigned to the administrative user.
