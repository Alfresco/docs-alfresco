# Working with folders

Once the document library structure has been set up, site members can access and work with the folders that organize the library content. In the content item list, clicking a folder name or thumbnail displays the contents of that folder. From this list, site members can also choose to view the folder details and edit the properties defined for a folder.

-   **[Viewing folder details](../tasks/library-folder-viewdetails.md)**  
The folderâ€™s details page gives you access to the actions available to be performed on the folder; the comments feature; custom metadata; and other details, including the folder URL, tags, and permission settings.
-   **[Viewing a folder in Alfresco Explorer](../tasks/library-folder-view-explorer.md)**  
The **View in Alfresco Explorer**action displays the selected folder in the Alfresco Explorer web client, providing access to all relevant actions.
-   **[Using rules](../concepts/library-folder-rules.md)**  
In the document library you can define rules on folders to provide creative solutions for automating and managing your content.
