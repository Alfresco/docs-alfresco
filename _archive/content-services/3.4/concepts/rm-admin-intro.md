# Administering Records Management

The administrator can manage Alfresco Records Management from the Management Console.

Users can only access the Management Console if they are members of the `ALFRESCO_ADMINISTRATORS` group.

-   **[Management Console](../concepts/rm-man-console.md)**  
The Management Console allows you to manage the Records Management site.
-   **[Accessing the Records Management Console](../tasks/rm-console-access.md)**  
This task assumes that you have access to the Records Management site dashlet and that you are logged in as a user that is a member of the `ALFRESCO_ADMINISTRATORS` group.
-   **[Records Management Auditing](../concepts/rm-audit-intro.md)**  
The function of the Records Management system is to manage and control electronic and physical records according to legislative and regulatory requirements, and it must be capable of demonstrating this compliance.
-   **[Creating custom metadata](../concepts/rm-custmeta-intro.md)**  
The Records Management installation defines a default set of metadata. The metadata is logged against each level in the File Plan and at the record level itself.
-   **[Defining roles and capabilities](../concepts/rm-roles-intro.md)**  
User permissions are set in Records Management using a combination of roles and capabilities.
-   **[Mapping emails](../concepts/rm-emailmap-intro.md)**  
The Alfresco Records Management system supports accessing the Alfresco server using IMAP. The protocol allows email applications that support IMAP to connect to and interact with Alfresco repositories directly from the mail application.
-   **[Managing events](../concepts/rm-events-intro.md)**  
In the Records Management system, events can control the life cycle of a record. There are several events that are defined internally to the system.
-   **[Creating a list of values](../concepts/rm-lov-intro.md)**  
Throughout the Records Management system, there are metadata entry fields. The metadata can be simple text strings, Boolean values, or dates.
