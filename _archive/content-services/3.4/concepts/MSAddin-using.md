# Using the Microsoft Office Add-In

The Microsoft Office Add-In enables you to use many of Alfresco Explorerâ€™s document management features from within Microsoft Office 2003.

**Note:** You can use the **Search topics** button to narrow the search scope to just this topic, or to this topic and its subtopics.

-   Click the **Search topics** button ![Search Topics icon](../topics/../images/e_quick_search_multi.gif) in the **Contents** toolbar.
-   Select **Search selected topic** or **Search selected topic and all subtopics** from the menu. A search window appears.
-   Enter your search query in the search window and click **OK**. The search results are listed in the **Search Results** view.

The examples in this guide use the Word 2003 application. The Microsoft Office Add-In works similarly with Excel and PowerPoint.

-   **[Accessing the Microsoft Office Add-In](../concepts/MSAddin-access.md)**  
The Microsoft Office Add-In starts automatically when Microsoft Word starts.
-   **[Setting up the panel](../tasks/MSAddin-panel-setup.md)**  
If your panel has not already been configured to work with your instance of Alfresco, the configuration information displays automatically.
-   **[Working with spaces](../concepts/MSAddin-spaces.md)**  
The Alfresco panel displays your documents in the same hierarchy of spaces as they exist in the Alfresco repository. The topics in this section describe how to use the Browse Spaces and Documents tab to navigate these spaces, view their contents, create new spaces, and upload a document to a space.
-   **[Managing documents](../concepts/MSAddin-manage-docs.md)**  
Once a document exists in the repository, there are a number of Alfresco Explorer functions available to you within Word. Each function exists in the Alfresco panel as an action that you can perform against your open Word document.
-   **[Accessing Alfresco Explorer](../concepts/MSAddin-access-explorer.md)**  
Use the launch action provided to easily start the Alfresco Explorer application in a new web browser window.
-   **[Searching](../tasks/MSAddin-searching.md)**  
Use the search feature provided to search for spaces and files in the Alfresco repository.
