# Using the AVM to Manage Web Content

Alfresco Web Content Management \(WCM\) is a content management system for your websites and web applications. It allows you to create, develop, and maintain your source code all within one repository.

The Using the AVM to Manage Web Content tutorial introduces the basic WCM concepts to accompany the download of Alfresco Explorer ECM \(Enterprise Content Management\). It demonstrates how to set up and configure Explorer for managing a website and showcases a sample web publishing scenario.

Alfresco recommends you download the Enterprise Trial and walk through this guided tutorial to familiarize yourself with the features. Refer to the user help provided with the application for information on using all WCM features.

-   **[System requirements and prerequisites](../tasks/gs-wcm-sysreq.md)**  
This tutorial assumes you are familiar with Alfresco Explorer.
-   **[Scenario](../concepts/gs-wcm-scenario.md)**  
For this tutorial, you will be walking through the following scenario.
-   **[Log in](../tasks/gs-wcm-login.md)**  
Log in to Alfresco Explorer using the default credentials.
-   **[Set up the web project](../concepts/gs-wcm-setup-project.md)**  
To set up a web project, you must create both web forms and the web project.
-   **[Add content to the web project](../concepts/gs-wcm-add-content.md)**  
There are multiple methods of adding and creating content for a web project. In addition to creating web content within a project, you can upload individual files from your computer and perform a bulk import. For the purpose of this tutorial, you will import content and generate content using web forms.
-   **[Manage web project content](../concepts/gs-wcm-manage-content.md)**  
At this point, your web project is populated with content items, some imported and some created, some submitted and some not. You must now deal with the approval of content items that were routed through workflow and the submission of the remaining items to staging.
-   **[Publish the website](../tasks/gs-wcm-publish.md)**  
With the web project content complete and submitted, you can now publish the Staging Sandbox snapshot to the production environment. Weâ€™ll deploy the website in stages, beginning with the initial version of the site after the content was imported to the project.
