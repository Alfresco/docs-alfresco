# Managing lists of values

Throughout the Records Management system, there are metadata entry fields. The metadata can be simple text strings, Boolean values, or dates.

There are two predefined lists in the Records Management installation that you can modify:

-   Supplementary marking list
-   Transfer Locations

Initially, these lists are empty. You can populate these lists with appropriate values.
