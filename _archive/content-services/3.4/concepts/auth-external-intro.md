# Configuring external authentication

The `external` authentication subsystem can be used to integrate Alfresco with any external authentication system.

The external authentication system can be integrated with your application server in such a way that the identity of the logged-in user is passed to servlets via the `HttpServletRequest.getRemoteUser()` method. As this is the standard way for application servers to propagate user identities to servlets, it should be compatible with a number of SSO solutions, including Central Authentication Service \(CAS\).

The subsystem also allows a proxy user to be configured, such that requests made through this proxy user are made in the name of an alternative user, whose name is carried in a configured HTTP request header. This allows, for example, the Share application and other Alfresco Surf applications to act as a client to an SSO-protected Alfresco application and assert the user name in a secure manner.

**Note:** Activating external authentication makes Alfresco accept external authentication tokens. Make sure that no untrusted direct access to Alfresco's HTTP or AJP ports is allowed.

The external subsystem supports the following properties.

This section provides an overview on how to install and use Alfresco on a Red Hat Enterprise Linux server that uses aÂ Central Authentication Service \(CAS\) server as a Single Sign-On \(SSO\) solution.
