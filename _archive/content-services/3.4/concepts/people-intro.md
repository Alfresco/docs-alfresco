# People

The People Finder feature lets you search for a particular user or display a list of all users.

From the user list you you can view a user's full profile. The profile details are organized across multiple pages:

-   **Info**

    The **Info** page displays the selected user's personal details, including contact information, company details, and a photo.

-   **Sites**

    The **Sites** page displays the sites the selected user is a member of. Click a site name in this list to navigate to that site.

-   **Content**

    The **Content** page displays two lists detailing the user's recent activities in their sites. The **Recently added** list shows the last three pieces of content from any site that the user added to Share. This includes wiki pages, blog postings, library content, and discussion items. The **Recently modified** list displays the last three pieces of content that the user changed. Click an item in either list to view it in its associated site.

-   **Following \(\#\)**

    The **Following** page displays a list of people who the selected user is following. The number to the right of the page label indicates how many people are currently being followed by this user. Click a name in this list to navigate to that user's profile. If the user has marked their list as private, this page will not appear in the profile.


**Note:** When viewing another user's profile these pages display only sites and content that you have permission to view.
