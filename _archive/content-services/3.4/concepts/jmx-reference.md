-   **[JMX read-only monitoring beans](../concepts/jmx-readonly-beans.md)**  
This section contains the list of read-only monitoring beans.
-   **[JMX configuration beans](../concepts/jmx-configuration-beans.md)**  
This section contains the list of configuration beans. Alfresco introduces an innovative way to manage the configuration of the individual Spring beans that compose the server. This feature is available for security and authentication configuration, which can be particularly complex to manage given the possibility of multiple-chained authentication services and authentication components, each with their own DAOs and other supporting services.
-   **[JMX editable management beans](../concepts/jmx-editman-beans.md)**  
This section contains the list of editable management beans.
