# Sites

A site is a collaborative area for a unit of work or a project. Users can create both public and private sites.

Public sites are available for all users to view but only site members can work within the site. This includes:

-   working with content in the Document Library
-   creating events in the site calendar
-   creating, commenting on, and publishing blog posts
-   creating and commenting on site links
-   working with discussion topics
-   working with wiki pages

Some public sites are configured to allow the Site Manager to moderate the site membership. To become a member of a moderated public site, you make a request to join the site or accept an invitation to join the site.

Private sites appear only to site members. To become a member of a private site, a Site Manager must extend an invitation to you.

Once a member of a site, you can choose to remove yourself at any time. On the site banner, selecting **Leave Site** from the **Actions** menu \(or the **More** menu if you are a Site Manager\) enables you to easily cancel your membership in the current site.

From the **Sites** menu on the toolbar, you can:

-   create a new site
-   enter any site marked as a favorite
-   display the Site Finder page component
-   mark the current site as a favorite

The Site Finder page component allows you to search for a particular site or display a list of all sites you can access: the Share public sites, sites you created, and sites \(public and private\) of which you are a member. From the site list, you can enter a site, delete a site, and manage your site membership by joining or leaving individual sites.

-   **[Creating a site](../tasks/sites-create.md)**  
You can create a site from anywhere in the application using the **Sites** menu on the toolbar. When creating a site, you have the option of making it public or private. The user who creates the site becomes the Site Manager.
-   **[Searching for a site](../tasks/sites-search.md)**  
The Site Finder page component enables you to search for sites. You can enter a site from the list displayed.
-   **[Managing your site membership](../tasks/sites-manage.md)**  
The Site Finder page component enables you to search for sites. Once found, you manage your membership in these sites by joining and leaving them. The results list displays the public sites, sites you created, and private sites of which you are a member that match the search criteria provided. You can enter a site from the list displayed.
-   **[Deleting a site](../tasks/sites-delete.md)**  
Delete a site to permanently remove it from the repository. Deleting a site also deletes all site content, including the Document Library content, Wiki pages, Blog posts, Calendar events, Links entries, and Discussion topics. Only a Site Manager can delete a site.
