# Getting Started

The Getting Started tasks enable you to familiarize yourself with the Share user interface, customize your personal dashboard, and set up your user profile. You need to perform the dashboard and user profile setup only once; however, you can revisit these components at any time to update, edit, or reconfigure the Share environment.

-   **[Becoming familiar with the user interface](../concepts/ui-description.md)**  
When you enter Share, you are presented with your personal dashboard. This is an interactive user interface that presents and organizes information that is relevant to you. You can customize the information that appears on this page.
