# Dictionary service

The Dictionary service supports methods to access and view content models and their definitions.

The content repository uses the repository Data Dictionary to manage definitions for content models such as folders, files, and metadata schemes. The content models are registered with the content repository to constrain the structure of nodes and the relationships between them, as well as to constrain property values.

The methods relating to the Dictionary service include the ability to:

-   Access content models
-   View content models
-   Query and inspect model definitions
