# Using the AVM

Todayâ€™s websites are becoming more and more complex with greater amounts of dynamic content, interactivity, and user-generated content.

Companies are looking for web infrastructure solutions that are:

-   Flexible to customize by web application developers
-   Easy to update by business users with content tools they already use
-   Integrated with full business process support and audit capability
-   Scalable to support large quantities of content and high numbers of users

This end user online help describes how to use Alfresco WCM functionality with the Alternative Versioning Model \(AVM\).

**Note:** You can use the **Search topics** button to narrow the search scope to just this topic, or to this topic and its subtopics.
