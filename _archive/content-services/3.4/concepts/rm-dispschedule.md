# Disposition schedules

Disposition schedules are a key function of the records management system. The disposition schedule defines the procedures required for maintaining records in the records management system until their eventual destruction or transfer to another location.

A disposition schedule contains one or more steps that define a particular function to be carried out at a date or after an event has occurred. An example disposition schedule is:

*Cutoff 30 days after filing, transfer to offline storage two years after cutoff and destroy seven years after transfer.*

The disposition functions are:

-   Retain
-   Cutoff
-   Transfer
-   Destroy

-   **[Creating disposition schedules](../tasks/rm-dispschedule-create.md)**  
The disposition schedule must be defined at a record category level. The procedure for creating a disposition schedule is a two part process. The first part is to create a summary of the schedule; the second part is to create the steps in the schedule.
-   **[Disposition schedule rules](../concepts/rm-dispschedule-rules.md)**
