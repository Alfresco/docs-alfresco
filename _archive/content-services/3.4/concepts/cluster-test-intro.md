# Verifying the cluster

This section describes how to verify that clustering is working for the various components involved. You will need direct Explorer access to each of the machines in the cluster. The operation is done on machine one \(M1\) and verified on the other machines \(Mx\). The process can be switched around with any machine being chosen as M1.
