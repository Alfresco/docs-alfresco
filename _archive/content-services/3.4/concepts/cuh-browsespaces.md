# Browse Spaces pane

The Browse Spaces pane displays all sub spaces contained within the current space.

There may be multiple pages of sub spaces. Use the navigation buttons provided to view the pages.

Throughout this document, the instruction to navigate to a particular space assumes that the space will be open in the working area and not simply visible in the Browse Spaces pane. When open, the name and description of the space appear in the space header; the Browse Spaces pane displays the sub spaces; and the Content Items pane displays the files the space contains. To perform functions on the open space, use the functions and menus on the right side of the header.

**Note:** When a space is listed as a sub space of the current space, you can use the icons \(actions\) associated with that sub space to perform functions on it. Use this shortcut if you are certain of the contents of the space and donâ€™t need to verify them before performing actions that may affect them.
