# Managing events

In the Records Management system, events can control the life cycle of a record. There are several events that are defined internally to the system.

A system event is generated whenever an action occurs on a record or folder, for example, versioned, cutoff, closed, superseded, and so on. These events can then be used in disposition instructions.

The following events are available in Records Management:

-   Event
-   Abolished
-   All Allowances Granted Are Terminated \(DoD 5015.2 event\)
-   Case Closed \(DoD 5015.2 event\)
-   Case Complete
-   No Longer needed
-   Obsolete
-   Redesignated
-   Related Record Transferred
-   Separation
-   Study Complete
-   Superseded
-   Training Complete
-   WGI action complete

Some events, like Case Closed and Allowances Terminated, are part of the DoD 5015.2 tests, but they are user-defined events, usually defined by the Records Manager.
