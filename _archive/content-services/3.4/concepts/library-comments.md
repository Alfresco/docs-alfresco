# Using comments

Adding comments to folders and individual library items is a convenient way to provide site users with information or notes specific to that content. While all users with access to the site can view the comments, only site members can add comments. You can edit and delete any comments that you added.

-   **[Adding a comment](../tasks/library-comment-add.md)**  
In the Document Library page component, you can add a comment to a folder or individual content item.
-   **[Editing a comment](../tasks/library-comment-edit.md)**  
You can edit a comment on a folder or individual content item to modify or add to its content. Only a Site Manager, a Site Collaborator, and the user who created the comment can edit it.
-   **[Deleting a comment](../tasks/library-comment-delete.md)**  
Delete a comment to permanently remove it from a folder or individual content item. Only a Site Manager and the user who created the comment can delete it.
