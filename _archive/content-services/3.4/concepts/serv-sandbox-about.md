# Sandbox service

Sandboxes in a web project provide users with an isolated working area in which to make changes to the web content without affecting the view of the data by other users. Workflow is then used to manage a controlled submission process for publishing the changes to the production web property.

There are various methods relating to the Sandbox service, including the ability to:

-   Create, read, modify, and delete content in a sandbox
-   Submit content from the sandbox for review, approval, and publishing
