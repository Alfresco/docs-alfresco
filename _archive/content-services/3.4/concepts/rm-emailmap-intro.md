# Mapping emails

The Alfresco Records Management system supports accessing the Alfresco server using IMAP. The protocol allows email applications that support IMAP to connect to and interact with Alfresco repositories directly from the mail application.

The Email mappings tool provides a facility to map the fields of an email header to the properties stored in the repository.

For example, an email `Subject` heading is mapped to the Alfresco property `title`. When you are viewing emails within the Records Management system, the `title` property shows the emailâ€™s `Subject` heading.

-   **[Default email mappings](../concepts/rm-emailmap-default.md)**  
The Email Mapping page shows a list of the current maps between email headers and Alfresco properties.
-   **[Adding an email map](../tasks/rm-emailmap-add.md)**  
The pre-defined email mappings cover the most commonly used email headers. You can include additional email header mappings using the Email Mappings tool.
