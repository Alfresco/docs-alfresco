# Using the Transformation Server

Whenever you upload your Office files in Share, you will now be using the Alfresco Transformation Server, and you can see results in the Share preview.

Administrators can view information about the server and transformation errors using the Web Console.

-   **[Using the Transformation Server Web Console](../tasks/transerv-webconsole.md)**  
Use the Transformation Server Web Console to view information about the server and transformation errors. The server lets you view the status of the server, a historical view of all the transformations completed, and the number of successful and failed transformations.
