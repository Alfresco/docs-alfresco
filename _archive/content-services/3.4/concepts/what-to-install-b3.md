# Installation files

There are a number of different installation files available to you, each of which you can choose depending on what is already installed on your system.

Download the installation files from the [Support Portal](http://support.alfresco.com).

The setup wizards install all the components you need for running Alfresco and ensure that you have all the recommended software installed and that configurations are set. When you install Alfresco using the setup wizards, it runs within an instance of the Tomcat application server.

If you wish to install Alfresco within an existing Tomcat or another application server, use the Alfresco WAR file. If you use the WAR file to install Alfresco, you must install the required additional components manually.

The setup wizards include the full Alfresco install with DM, Explorer, Share, WCM, JDK, OpenOffice, and SharePoint Protocol Support functionality, Records Management, Web Editor, Web Quick Start, and Quickr Connector Support. Use this file if no Alfresco component is installed on your system.
