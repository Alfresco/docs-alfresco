# Set up the web project

To set up a web project, you must create both web forms and the web project.

-   **[Create web forms](../tasks/gs-wcm-create-forms.md)**  
A web form enables users to create XML content from a simple browser-based form. In this first task, you will create two web forms, one of which is associated with rendering engine templates.
-   **[Create the web project](../tasks/gs-wcm-create-project.md)**  
You create a web project using the Create Web Project Wizard.
