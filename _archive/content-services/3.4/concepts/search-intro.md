# Searching for content

The search field provided on the toolbar enables you to quickly perform both basic and advanced searches.

This feature can return the following content:

-   items and folders from the Document Library page component
-   pages from the Wiki page component
-   posts from the Blog page component
-   events from the Calendar page component
-   links from the Links page component

When you perform a search from your personal dashboard, the result set displays the matches found in all sites.

When you perform a search from within a site, three result sets are offered: matches found in the current site, matches found in all sites, and matches found in the repository. By default, the result set for the current site is displayed.

When you perform a search from within the repository, two result sets are offered: matches found in the repository and matches found in all sits. By default, the result set for the repository is displayed.
