# Add content to the web project

There are multiple methods of adding and creating content for a web project. In addition to creating web content within a project, you can upload individual files from your computer and perform a bulk import. For the purpose of this tutorial, you will import content and generate content using web forms.

-   **[Import the sample dynamic website](../tasks/gs-wcm-import-sample.md)**  
Your newly created web project, alfrescosample, contains no content. In this task, you will use the Bulk Import feature to populate the web project. Once imported, you will submit the content to staging to create an initial snapshot of the project, which you can preview.
-   **[Create web content: Company Profiles](../tasks/gs-wcm-create-content-profiles.md)**  
In this task, you will use one of your web forms to create four new content items, each one a company profile.
-   **[Create web content: Press Releases](../tasks/gs-wcm-create-content-releases.md)**  
In this task, create additional content for your website using a web form with an associated template. Once the content is complete, you can preview it. Unlike in the previous task, do not submit the content; you will do this as a separate task.
