# Using shortcuts

In the **Shelf** view of the sidebar, expand **Shortcuts** to display the shortcuts to spaces and/or content items that you have created. Shortcuts can save you time navigating the repository in search of spaces and content you use often.

-   **[Creating a shortcut to a space](../tasks/tuh-shortcut-tospace.md)**  
Create shortcuts to spaces you expect to access frequently.
-   **[Creating a shortcut to a content item](../tasks/tuh-shortcut-tocontent.md)**  
Create shortcuts to content items you expect to access frequently. This can save you time navigating the repository.
-   **[Removing a shortcut from a space or content item](../tasks/tuh-shortcut-remove.md)**  
When you no longer require a shortcut to a space or content item, you can delete it.
