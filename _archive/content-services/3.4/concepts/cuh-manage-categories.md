# Managing categories

Categories allow users to quickly and easily organize their content by classifying content items.

An Administrator creates and manages the categories, which are organized into related groups to form a hierarchy. Users then link content items to one or more categories to classify the content items.

The Category Management page header provides functionality to toggle between the **Categories** view and the **Details** view. To aid navigation, a hierarchy path appears beneath the page header. Click the links in this path to navigate the category hierarchy.

-   **[Adding a category](../tasks/tuh-manage-category-add.md)**  
Add a category at the top level or as a sub-category to an existing category.
-   **[Deleting a category](../tasks/tuh-manage-category-delete.md)**  
Delete a category that you no longer want users to be able to access.
-   **[Editing a category](../tasks/tuh-manage-category-edit.md)**  
Edit a category to change its name or description.
