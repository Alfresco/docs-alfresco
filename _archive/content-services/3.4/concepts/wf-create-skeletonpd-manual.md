# Creating a skeleton process definition manually

The high-level parts of the process definition are shown in the Adhoc task example. The complete process definition is shown in the Process definition for an ad hoc task.

The initiator can specify the following information through the UI:

-   Task description

-   Due date \(optional\)

-   Priority

-   Request for email notification of task completion \(optional\)
