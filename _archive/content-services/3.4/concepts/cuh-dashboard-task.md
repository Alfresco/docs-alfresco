# Working with dashboard tasks

Once configured to display your current tasks, you can use the dashboard to manage all tasks assigned to you.

The reason a task appears in your **My Tasks To Do** list may vary. A task can be assigned to you because:

-   you are indicated in a defined workflow as the reviewer
-   you initiated a workflow that is now complete and can be marked as such
-   you initiated a workflow and the content needs to be addressed in order for the workflow to continue \(for example, the content contains broken links or was rejected by the reviewer\)

The entry in the **Type** column in your task list indicates the reason the task has been assigned.

-   **[Managing a task](../tasks/tuh-dashboard-task-manage.md)**  
The **My Tasks To Do** pane displays all tasks assigned to the currently logged in user. The **Type** column indicates the reason the task has been assigned.
-   **[Reassigning a task](../tasks/tuh-dashboard-task-reassign.md)**  
You can reassign any task in your task list to another user. This simply moves the selected task from your task list to the task list of the selected user.
-   **[Viewing a completed task](../tasks/tuh-dashboard-task-view.md)**  
You can view the details of any completed task in the **My Completed Tasks** pane. This information is read-only.
-   **[Cancelling workflow for a task](../tasks/tuh-dashboard-task-cancelworkflow.md)**  
You can cancel the workflow that is currently in progress for a task in the **My Completed Tasks** pane. Only the user who started the workflow can cancel it.
