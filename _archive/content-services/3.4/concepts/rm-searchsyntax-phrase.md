# Search for a phrase

Phrases are enclosed in double quotes. Any embedded quotes may be escaped using `"\"`. If no field is specified then the default TEXT field will be used, as with searches for a single term.

The whole phrase will be tokenized before the search according to the appropriate data dictionary definition\(s\).

```
"big yellow banana"
```
