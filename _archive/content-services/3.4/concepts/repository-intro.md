# Repository

The **Repository** option displays the contents of the Alfresco Explorer repository within the framework of a Document Library.

**Note:** If the **Repository** option on the toolbar is not available, contact the Share administrator.

This view of the repository provides all of the actions available within a site's Document Library page component with the exception of the **Edit Offline** action.

Just as in the Document Library, the browsing pane on the left side of the view provides navigation and filtering options. In this view you can filter the repository contents by category or tag, or you can browse the repository file structure. You can also choose to view the content items currently checked out to you \(**I'm Editing** view\) or those that you have specifically flagged as favorites \(**My Favorites** view\).

The functionality available within the Repository Document Library, with the exception of Permissions, is identical to what you find in a site Document Library. Refer to the Document Library topics for details on performing specific actions within the Repository view.

-   **[Managing permissions in the Repository Document Library](../tasks/repository-manage-permissions.md)**  
Managing permissions for a content in the Repository Document Library is equivalent to inviting users to a space in Alfresco Explorer. You can add and set roles for both individual users and user groups. In setting permissions, you are assigning the roles that are defined in Explorer, which are different from the site members roles available in Share.
