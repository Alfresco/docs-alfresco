# Capabilities

A capability is an ability that can be granted to a user, which controls the behavior of the system. With respect to the user, this may be to grant a certain operation, or privilege or it may be to alter the behavior of the system for that user.

Capabilities cannot conflict and are not hierarchical. A user can be granted a single capability and that capability will not grant any further capabilities. Any user may have zero or more capabilities within the system. A user that has no capabilities is effectively barred from the records management system.
