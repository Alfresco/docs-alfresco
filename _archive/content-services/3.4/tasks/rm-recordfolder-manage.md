# Managing record folders

Record folders can be managed by users with the permissions capability.

1.  Navigate to the File Plan and select a record category.

    The items list shows the available record folders within the category.

2.  In the items list, position the cursor over the record folder of interest to display the available actions.

    The following actions are available:

    |Series actions|Description|
    |--------------|-----------|
    |View Details|View the record folder details page, which includes the metadata and full list of actions.|
    |Edit Metadata|Edit the record folder metadata.|

User with the appropriate capability \(Folder Control\) can close folders. Closed folders cannot accept any further records.
-   **[Freezing record folders](../tasks/rm-recordfolder-freeze.md)**  
Users with the appropriate capability \(Extend Retention Period Or Freeze\) may freeze any number of records or folders.
