# Viewing and managing the invited users

On the Pending Invites page you can view the full list of invited users or search for a particular user. This page enables you to view the users that have been invited to join the current site. When you invite a user to join your site, you can revoke the invitation until it is accepted.

This task assumes you are in the Members page component of the desired site.

1.  Click **Pending Invites** beneath the banner if this page is not already selected.

    This page displays a list of all users who have been invited to join the current site.

2.  In the **Filter** box, type the full or partial name of the invited user you want to locate.

3.  Click **Search**.

    The page displays the users matching the search criteria entered who have been invited to be members of the site.

4.  Click **Cancel** to the right of the user whose invitation you wish to revoke.

    Share cancels the invitation and removes the user from the list.
