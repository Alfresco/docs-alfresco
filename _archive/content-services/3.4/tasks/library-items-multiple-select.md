# Selecting multiple items

Select multiple items in the current view using the item check boxes to the left of each item thumbnail or the **Select** feature at the top of the item list. You can select items, folders, or a combination of the two.

This task assumes you are in the Document Library page component of the desired site.

1.  In the browsing pane, select a view, folder, or tag to display the desired library items.

2.  In the item list displayed, select the desired content items:

    -   Click a check box to select the associated item.
    -   Click **Select** at the top of the item list and click the list element you want to select: **Documents**, **Folders**, or **All**.
    Click **None** to clear the list selections. Click **Invert Selection** to toggle the check boxes to their opposite state.


The check boxes of the specified items appear selected in the item list.
