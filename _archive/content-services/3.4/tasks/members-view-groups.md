# Viewing site groups

The Search for Site Groups page enables you to search for a particular group that has been added to the current site.

This task assumes you are in the Members page component of the desired site.

1.  Click **Groups** beneath the banner if this page is not already selected.

2.  In the search box, type the full or partial name of the site group you want to locate.

    **Note:** Leaving the search box empty returns a list of all groups for the current site.

3.  Click **Search**.


The page displays a list of the current site groups matching the criteria provided. From this list, you can change a group's role or remove a group from the site.

-   **[Adding groups to a site](../tasks/members-invite-groups.md)**  
To save yourself time inviting multiple users individually to join a site, you can add existing user groups to the current site. This process involves searching for the group, assigning a role to the group as a whole, and then adding the group. Unlike inviting users, no invitation is extended; the group is added immediately. The available user roles are Manager, Collaborator, Contributor, and Consumer.
