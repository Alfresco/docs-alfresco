# Selecting a page component

The site banner displays the page components included in the site. Once you enter a site, you can navigate between the page components to view information and perform functions on the site content.

1.  Enter the desired site.

    The site banner beneath the application toolbar displays the name of the selected site.

2.  On the site dashboard banner, click the page component you want to access.

    The application displays the selected page component and the current component is highlighted on the banner. Each component has its own functionality. See the appropriate section of the documentation for instructions on using each page component.

3.  On the site dashboard banner, click any page component to navigate to that page or click **Site Dashboard** to return to the dashboard for the current site.
