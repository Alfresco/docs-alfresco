1.  Locate the event you want to edit.

2.  Select the desired view: **Day** or **Week**.

3.  Edit the event:

    1.  Position the cursor on the resizing bar at the bottom of the event span. Click and drag the bar to adjust the duration of the event.

    2.  Position the cursor anywhere in the event span. Click and drag the entire event to position the start time as desired.

    3.  \(**Week** view only\) Position the cursor anywhere in the event span. Click and drag the entire event to a different day and time as desired.
