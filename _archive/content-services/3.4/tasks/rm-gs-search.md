# Searching for records

The next step in the scenario is to search for records. The Search records functionality allows you to search the records in the Alfresco repository, and to save the results in a Saved Search area.

You can search for categories, series, and folders separately.

From here you will:

1.  Create a simple search for records.

2.  Save your simple search.

3.  View your saved search.


-   **[Accessing Records Search](../tasks/rm-gs-search-access.md)**  
Accessing the records search enables you to create a search query to locate and view a list of records specified.
-   **[Creating a simple search](../tasks/rm-gs-search-create.md)**  
This task assumes you are in the Search page.
-   **[Creating advanced searches](../concepts/rm-gs-search-adv.md)**  
The Search feature allows you to enter a full range of queries, from the very simple, single word queries, to complex and advanced queries.
-   **[Search query examples](../concepts/rm-gs-search-examples.md)**  
This section provides you with some example search queries that are common in the Records Management environment and shows how to specify the query syntax.
-   **[Saving a search](../tasks/rm-gs-search-save.md)**  
This task assumes that you are in the Search page, viewing the results of a search query on the Results tab.
