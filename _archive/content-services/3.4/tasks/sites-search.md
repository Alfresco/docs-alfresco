# Searching for a site

The Site Finder page component enables you to search for sites. You can enter a site from the list displayed.

1.  On the toolbar, expand the **Sites** menu and click **Search for Sites**.

    The Site Finder page component appears.

2.  In the search box, type the full or partial name of the desired site and click **Search**.

    Leaving the search box empty returns all public sites, all sites you created \(public and private\), and all sites of which you are a member \(public and private\).

    The results list appears beneath the search box and displays all existing sites matching the criteria entered. This list includes only public sites \(including moderated sites\), sites created by you, and private sites of which you are a member. Private sites you are not a member of do not appear. To the right of a site, the actions **Join** and **Request to Join** indicate you are not a member of that site; the action **Leave** indicates you are currently a member of that site.


To enter a site from this page component, click the site name.
