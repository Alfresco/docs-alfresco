# Socializing a document from Alfresco to Jive

This section describes how to socialize a document from Alfresco to Jive.

1.  Navigate to the Document Library in an Alfresco Share site.

2.  Find the document that you want to socialize to Jive.

    For multiple documents, select the check box on all the documents that you want to socialize.

3.  From the **Actions** menu, select **Socialize**.

    You see the **Select community...** window showing the available Jive spaces in a hierarchy.

4.  Select a Jive space name from the right-hand **Community** column as the Jive destination.

5.  Click **OK**.

    The file is socialized to Jive.

    **Note:** Each document can be socialized only once between Alfresco and Jive.

    If you see the message **Failed to connect to Jive. Please try again shortly. If the error persist please contact your system administrator.**, it is possible that the Jive instance is not running or configured correctly. Check that the shared passwords are the same in the Alfresco and Jive configuration.


The document then becomes visible and accessible in the Jive user interface in exactly the same way as a native document.

If you later upload a new version of the socialized document to Alfresco, the updated content will be available within Jive, and in the same way, if you upload a new version to Jive, the updated content will be available in Alfresco.
