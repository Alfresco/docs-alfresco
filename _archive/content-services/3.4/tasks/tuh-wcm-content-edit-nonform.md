# Editing content not generated from a web form

Content items not generated from a web form—content that was uploaded or imported, or HTML and plain text documents created within the project—must be edited locally on your computer.

Inline editing of HTML and plain text documents is not available within web projects.

1.  In the web project, locate the content item you want to edit.

2.  Click ![Edit](../images/im-edit.png) **\(Edit\)** for that item.

3.  Follow the directions on the page displayed to save the file to your computer.

4.  On your computer, open the file with the relevant desktop application, make the required changes, and save the file.

    Once edited, you must update the file in the web project.
