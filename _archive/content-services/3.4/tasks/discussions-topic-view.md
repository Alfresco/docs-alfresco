# Viewing a topic

Browsing the discussion forum displays the existing topics in the main window of the Discussions page component. These topics display in either a summary view or a simple list. Viewing a topic allows you to see the full contents of the discussion.

This task assumes you are in the Discussions page component of the desired site.

Although you can perform actions on a topic from the main page, viewing the topic enables you to confirm you have selected the correct topic before you edit, delete, or reply to it.

1.  Browse the discussion topics to locate the topic you want to view.

2.  Click **View** to the right of the topic.

    Alternately, you can click the title of the topic or click **Read** beneath the topic. If the main page displays the simple view, you must click **View** or the topic title.

    The topic view displays the selected topic in its entirety, along with any replies.

3.  Click **Discussions Topic List** to return to the main view.


**Parent topic:**[The discussions forum](../concepts/discussions-intro.md)
