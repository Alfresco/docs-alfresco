# Deleting a link comment

Delete a comment to permanently remove it from a link. Only a Site Manager and the user who created the comment can delete it.

This task assumes you are in the Links page component of the desired site.

1.  Locate and view the link containing the comment you want to delete.

2.  Scroll to the bottom of the page to view the comments.

3.  Click **Delete** to the right of the comment you want to remove.

    This action is available only when the currently logged in user has permission to delete the comment.

    A message prompts you to confirm the deletion of the selected comment.

4.  Click **Delete**.

    A message indicates the selected comment has been deleted.
