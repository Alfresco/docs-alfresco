# Managing your site membership

The Site Finder page component enables you to search for sites. Once found, you manage your membership in these sites by joining and leaving them. The results list displays the public sites, sites you created, and private sites of which you are a member that match the search criteria provided. You can enter a site from the list displayed.

1.  On the toolbar, expand the **Sites** menu and click **Search for Sites**.

    The Site Finder page component appears.

2.  Perform a search.

    The results list appears beneath the search box. To the right of a site, the action **Join** \(or **Request to Join** for moderated public sites\) indicates you are not a member of that site; the action **Leave** indicates you are currently a member of that site.

3.  In the results list, manage your membership in sites as follows:

    -   Click **Join** to become a member of a public site.
    -   Click **Request to Join** to request membership in a moderated public site.
    -   Click **Leave** to remove yourself from a site in which you no longer wish to be a member.
    The **Leave Site** link in the **Actions** menu \(or the **More** menu if you are a Site Manager\) on the site banner enables you to remove yourself as a member of the current site.


To enter a site from this page component, click the site name.
