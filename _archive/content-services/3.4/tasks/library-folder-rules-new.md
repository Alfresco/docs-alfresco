# Creating a new rule

A rule set can contain any number of rules. Create new rules for the current rule set as necessary.

This task assumes you are on the Rules page in the Document Library page component and that the selected folder has a defined rule set.

1.  Click **New Rule**.

    The New Rule page appears.

    **Note:** The steps to create a new rule within an existing rule set are the same as for creating a rule from scratch. This topic provides a high-level description of the steps involved; refer to the topic *Creating a new rule from scratch* for full details.

2.  Enter a name \(required\) and description \(optional\) for the rule.

3.  Specify the event\(s\) to trigger the rule.

    **Note:** You can specify multiple events. Use the icons to the right of the fields to add and remove options.

4.  Specify the rule conditions.

    You can use inclusive \(if\) conditions, exclusive \(unless\) conditions, or a combination of the two. Define any number of conditions per rule. Use the icons to the right of the fields to add and remove conditions as necessary.

5.  Specify the action\(s\) to be performed when the rule is triggered.

    Define any number of actions per rule. Use the icons to the right of the fields to add and remove conditions as necessary.

    **Note:** On this page, the symbol ![](../images/im-missinginfo.png) to the left of a condition or action indicates required information is missing. You must correct this in order to create the rule.

6.  In the Other Options section, specify additional options for the rules as desired.

7.  Click **Create**.

    **Note:** If you intend to immediately create another rule, click **Create and Create Another**. This creates the rule specified and clears the fields so you can create another rule for the same folder.


After creating the last rule, you return to the Rules page. Any new rules created are added at the end of the rule set.
