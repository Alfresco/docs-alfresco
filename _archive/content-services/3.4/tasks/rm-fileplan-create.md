# Creating the File Plan

The next step in the scenario is to create the File Plan structure.

From here, you will be able to:

-   Build a hierarchical File Plan structure
-   Upload files and create records
-   Navigate the records within the structure
-   Manage disposition schedules
-   Search for records

The File Plan navigation panel contains a navigation hierarchy showing the hierarchical structure.

To create your File Plan structure:

1.  In the Records Management banner, click **File Plan**.

    The File Plan page displays.

2.  Click **New Series**.

    The New Record Series window displays.

3.  Add the following information:

    1.  **Name**: A name that will be used as the name of the record series. This is mandatory and must be unique within the File Plan.

    2.  **Title**: An additional title that will be used as supplementary information for the record series name. The title appears in brackets in the record series item list.

    3.  **Description**: A description for the record series that will be used in the record series details.

4.  Click **Submit**.

    The new series displays in the File Plan item list and also displays in the navigation panel. In the item list, the name of the series is a link.

5.  Click the new series link.

    You see an item list for the record category level.

6.  Click **New Category**.

    The New Record Category window displays.

7.  Add the following information:

    1.  **Name**: A name that will be used as the name of the record category. This is mandatory and must be unique within the category level.

    2.  **Title**: A additional title that will be used as supplementary information for the record category name.

    3.  **Description**: A description for the record category.

    4.  **Vital Record Indicator**: Defines whether records in this category have a review process. The Vital Record Indicator is applied at the category level and is propagated down to the record folders within that category. Note: you can also change this setting at the folder level.

    5.  **Review Period**: This has two fields: Period and Expression.

8.  Click **Submit**.

    The new category displays in the File Plan item list and displays in the navigation panel. In the item list, the name of the category is a link.

9.  Click the new category link.

    You see the item list for the record folder level.

10. Click New Folder.

    The New Record Folder window displays.

11. Add the following information:

    1.  **Name**: A name that will be used as the name of the record folder. This is mandatory and must be unique within the folder level.

    2.  **Title**: A additional title that will be used as supplementary information for the record folder name.

    3.  **Description**: A description for the record folder.

    4.  **Location**: The location for the records contained within this folder.

12. Click **Submit**.

    The new folder displays in the File Plan. New record folders are as marked open, which means that records may be filed in them. The date of opening is recorded as the same time as the creation date.


You have now created a basic File Plan structure from which you can build further levels and manage records.
