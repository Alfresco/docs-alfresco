2.  In the **Search for People** section, type the full or partial name of an internal user you want to invite and click **Search**.

    **Important:** If you do not have any users for this installation, add them using the Share Admin Console \(on the toolbar, expand the **More** menu and click **Users**\). Otherwise, skip to step 4.

3.  Click **Add** associated with the user you want to add.

    The user displays in the **Invite Users** list.

4.  In the **Add External Users** section, type the first name, last name, and email for the external user you want to invite, then click Add.

5.  In the Invite Users list, select a role from the Select Role menu for each user.

    **Note:** If you want to assign all users the same role, select a role from the Set All Roles to menu to apply to all of the users listed. The role displays in the menu.
