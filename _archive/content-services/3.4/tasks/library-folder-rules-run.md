# Running rules

When you create or edit a rule set for a folder that already contains content, the rules are not applied to the existing content. The **Run Rules** feature allows you to manually run the rule set on the folder to ensure the existing content is included. You have the option of running the rules on only the current folder or on the folder and its subfolders.

This task assumes you are on the Rules page in the Document Library page component and that the selected folder has a defined rule set.

-   Click **Run Rules** and select the desired action:

    -   **Run rules for this folder**
    -   **Run rules for this folder and its subfolders**

A message informs you that the rules have been run.
