# Deleting a user account

Delete a user account to remove the user from the system.

**Note:** Deleting a user does not remove their permissions from the repository. These permissions are reused if the user is recreated in the future. To keep an account but stop the user having access to the application, consider disabling the user account instead.

1.  On the toolbar, expand the **More** menu and click **Users** in the Tools list.

    The User Search page appears.

2.  Search for and select the desired user.

3.  On the User Profile page, click **Delete User**.

    A message prompts you to confirm the deletion.

4.  Click **Delete**.
