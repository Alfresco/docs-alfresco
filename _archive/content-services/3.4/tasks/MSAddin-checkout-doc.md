# Checking out a document

When editing content, you can check out a content item to prevent other users from overwriting your work.

Checking out content locks the original file and creates a working copy in the same space for you to work with.

1.  Open Microsoft Office.

    The Alfresco Microsoft Add-In panel displays

2.  On the Browse Spaces and Documents tab of the Alfresco panel, navigate to the document you want to check out.

3.  Select ![Check Out](../images/MSAddin-checkoutbutton.png) \(**Check Out**\) associated with the document you want to modify.

    The original document locks and the working copy becomes available to modify in both the Browse Spaces and Documents tab and the My Alfresco tab. The icon ![Lock icon](../images/MSAddin-lock.png) beside the original document indicates it is locked.
