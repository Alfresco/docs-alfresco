# Viewing an item

The preview feature enables you to view a content item directly in the application without having to download it to your computer or check it out. For documents containing multiple pages, navigation features enable you to view all pages. In addition to the preview, this page displays full document details and a comment feature that enables site members to add comments on the item being viewed.

This task assumes you are in the Document Library page component of the desired site.

1.  Navigate the libraryâ€™s folder structure to locate the content item you want to view.

2.  In the item list, click the title or thumbnail of the desired item.

    The details page opens. The left side of the page displays the name and a preview of the selected item. The right side of the page contains the item details, including metadata, tags, permissions, version history, document actions, and related URLs. Comments made on the selected item appear at the bottom of the page, along with the **Add Comment**box. In the header, the **Location** path indicates the folder in which the selected item resides.

3.  When the content item contains multiple pages, use the features provided to navigate the pages:

    1.  Click the left and right arrow buttons to move backward and forward through the pages one at a time.

    2.  In the **Page** box, type the number of the page you want to view and press ENTER.

4.  Resize the preview as necessary using the tools provided:

    1.  Move the slider left to decrease and right to increase the size of the preview.

    2.  Use the - and + buttons to decrease and increase the size of the preview in increments of 10%.

    3.  Use the menu to select a specific size: **Actual Size**, **Fit Page**, **Fit Width**, or **Fit Height**.

    4.  Click **Fullscreen** to expand the preview pane to the full monitor size. On the fullscreen view, press ESC to return to the details page.

    5.  Click **Maximize** to expand the preview pane to the size of the browser window. The item appears within the browser frame. On the maximized view, press ESC to return to the details page.

5.  Use and share the URLs provided.

    You can bookmark the URLs or share them with other users via email or instant messaging. When invoked, these links prompt the user to save the content item locally \(**Download File URL**\), open the content item directly in the browser \(**Document URL**\), and display the current page \(**This Page URL**\).

6.  Where previous versions of the document exist, expand an item in the **Version History** section to view the details for that version. From here you can:

    -   Click **Download** to obtain a copy of that particular version of the document.
    -   Click **Revert** to replace the current version of the document with the content of the earlier version.
7.  Scroll to the bottom of the page to view comments related to the selected item.

8.  In the header, click the desired folder in the Location path to return to the item list for that folder.

While the preview feature enables you to view and navigate a content item directly in the application, you also have the option of viewing the item in your default browser.
