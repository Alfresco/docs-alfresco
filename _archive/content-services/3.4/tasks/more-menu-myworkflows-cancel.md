# Cancelling a workflow

When a workflow is no longer required, you can cancel it. This removes the workflow from your Workflows I’ve Started page. It also deletes all tasks related to the workflow, removing them from the assignees’ My Tasks dashlets.

This task assumes you are on the Workflows I've Started page.

1.  In the workflow list, position the cursor over the workflow you wish to cancel to display the available actions.

2.  Click **Cancel Workflow**.

    A message prompts you to confirm the cancellation.

3.  Click **Yes**.

    The selected workflow is cancelled and removed from the workflow list.
