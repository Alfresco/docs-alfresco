# Writing a news article

Create an article in the Quick Start Share site so that it can then be added to asset collections to be included as website content. Content created within the Quick Start Editorial branch of the site is automatically given the type `ws:article`.

This task assumes you are in the Document Library page component of the Quick Start site and that the **Show Folders** feature is enabled.

1.  Navigate to **Alfresco Quick Start \> Quick Start Editorial \> root \> news**.

2.  Select the subsection where you wish to add a new article: **companies**, **global**, or **markets**.

    As an example, selecting **global** displays the contents of the Global Economy page in the demo website: two articles and their related images. An article created here will display on the Global Economy page.

3.  Click **Create Content** and then select **HTML**.

    The Create Content page appears.

4.  Type a name for the page. This is the filename for the item in the Document Library.

    The **Name** field does not support the following special characters: \* < \> \\ / . ? : and \|. When the name contains a disallowed character, the **Create** button is disabled.

5.  Provide a title and description.

    This is the information that will appear on the web page.

6.  Type the desired content in the **Content** box.

    Use the features provided to format the text; insert bulleted and numbered lists; color the text and background; insert or edit links, anchors, and images; and insert and customize tables. To assist with editing, use the undo, redo, and remove formatting features as needed. Position the cursor over an icon to display its function. Click and drag the bottom right corner to resize the text editor.

7.  Click **Create**.

    The page closes and the item list displays the newly created HTML content. This article is now available to be added to web pages through a static or dynamic asset collection.
