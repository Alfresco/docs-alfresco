# Deleting a link

Delete a link to permanently remove it from the Links page component. Deleting a link also deletes all comments associated with it. Only the Site Manager and the user who created the link can delete it.

This task assumes you are in the Links page component of the desired site.

1.  In the links list, locate the link you want to delete.

    When deleting more than one link, use the multiple selection feature provided.

2.  Click **Delete** to the right of that link.

    A message prompts you to confirm the deletion of the selected link.

3.  Click **Delete**.


A message indicates the selected link has been deleted.

-   **[Deleting multiple links](../tasks/links-delete-multiple.md)**  
In the links list, select multiple links using the check boxes to the left of each link or the **Select** feature at the top of the links list. This enables you to quickly delete multiple links, rather than removing them one at a time.
