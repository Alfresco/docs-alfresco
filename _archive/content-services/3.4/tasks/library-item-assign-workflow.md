# Starting a workflow

In the Document Library component, you attach a workflow directly to one or more content items. Starting a workflow generates a workflow task. You then manage the tasks resulting from workflow on the My Tasks dashlet on your personal dashboard.

This task assumes you are in the Document Library page component of the desired site.

This feature is also available for multiple selections.

1.  Navigate the libraryâ€™s folder structure to locate the item you want to work with.

2.  In the item list, position the cursor over the item of interest to display the available actions.

3.  Click **More** and then **Start Workflow**.

    **Note:** Alternatively, click **Start Workflow** on the My Tasks personal dashlet, the My Tasks page, or the Workflows I've Started page to begin a workflow that is not associated with a content item.

    The Start Workflow page appears.

4.  Expand the **Workflow** list and select the type of workflow you want to define.

    Out of the box, Share includes the following preconfigured workflows:

    -   **Adhoc**

        Enables you to assign a task to a single user

    -   **Group Review & Approve**

        Enables you to set up review and approval of content, assigning the workflow task to a single group

    -   **Parallel Review & Approve**

        Enables you to set up review and approval of content, assigning the workflow task to multiple users.

    -   **Pooled Review & Approve**

        Enables you to set up review and approval of content, assigning the workflow task to multiple users. One user can take ownership of the task at a time, completing it or returning it to the pool to be claimed by another user associated with the task.

    -   **Review & Approve**

        Enables you to set up review and approval of content, assigning the workflow task to a single user

    -   **Review & Publish**

        Enables you to review and publish web content. This option is specific to the Web Quick Start demo.

    -   **Review & Publish Section Structure**

        Enables you to review and publish the structure of a section of the website. This option is specific to the Web Quick Start demo.

    The appropriate workflow form displays where you enter the details of the workflow task being initiated.

5.  Complete the workflow form. Required fields are marked with an asterisk \(\*\).

    The text entered in the **Message** field displays in the My Tasks dashlet for the workflow task. This content should clearly explain to the user what they are expected to do with the related content item\(s\).

    For the Assignee, click **Select** and perform a search to locate the user or group to be responsible for the workflow task. Click **Add** to select the desired user; click **Select** for the desired group.

    **Note:** This search requires a minimum of one \(1\) character; it is not case sensitive. You can provide a full or partial name.

6.  Click **Start Workflow**.

    The workflow task is created. In the content item list, an icon to the left of the items selected indicates that they are part of an active workflow.
