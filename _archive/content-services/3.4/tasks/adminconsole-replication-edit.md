# Editing a replication job

You can easily update existing replication jobs. In addition to changing the job details, you can use this feature to disable a job so that it will not be run.

1.  On the toolbar, expand the **More** menu and click **Replication Jobs** in the Tools list.

2.  In the Jobs section, click the job you want to edit.

    The job appears highlighted in the list and its details appear on the right side of the page.

3.  Click **Edit**.

    The Edit Replication Job page appears.

4.  Edit the replication job as necessary. All job details—name, description, payload, transfer target, and schedule—are available for editing.

    Add and remove source items as necessary. Click **Remove** to the right of a single item to remove it. Click **Remove All** beneath the list to remove all items.

    Deselect the **Enabled** check box to prevent the job from being run.

5.  Click **Save**.

    The main page displays the updated job details.
