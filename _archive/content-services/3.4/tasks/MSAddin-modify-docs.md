# Modifying documents

You edit both checked in and checked out repository documents in the same way.

1.  On the My Alfresco tab or the Browse Spaces and Documents tab of the Alfresco panel, click the document you want to edit to open it.

    The document displays in Word and the Alfresco panel displays the Document Details tab listing the document metadata.

2.  Modify the document in Word as necessary.

3.  Save and close the file.


If you were editing a working copy, you can now check it in if no further work is required.
