# Cancelling workflow for a task

You can cancel the workflow that is currently in progress for a task in the **My Completed Tasks** pane. Only the user who started the workflow can cancel it.

Performing this action rolls back the entire task, undoing any steps that had already taken place as part of the defined workflow.

1.  In the **My Completed Tasks** list, click ![Cancel Workflow](../images/im-dshbd_cancelworkflow.png) **\(Cancel Workflow\)** for the task whose workflow you want to cancel.

    A message prompts you to confirm the cancellation of the workflow.

2.  Click **Yes** to cancel the workflow for this task.
