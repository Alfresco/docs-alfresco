# Adding an event

Any site member can schedule an event that is relevant to the site. Once created, the event appears on the site calendar.

This task assumes you are in the Calendar page component of the desired site.

1.  Initiate the event creation in one of the following ways:

    -   Click **Add Event** in the header.
    -   Select the desired event date on the browsing pane calendar and click **Add Event** in the header.
    -   Navigate the calendar on the main view and click ![Add event](../images/AddEvent_icon.png) on the desired event date.
    Simply clicking **Add Event** causes the start and end dates to default to the current date. Specifying a date first, as in the other two methods, causes the start and end dates to default to the date selected.

    The **Add Event** page appears. Fields marked with an asterisk \(\*\) are required.

2.  Type a name for the event in the **What** box.

    This entry does not support the following special characters: \* < \> \\ / . ? : and \|.

3.  Type the location of the event in the **Where** box.

4.  Provide a **Description** of the event you are scheduling.

5.  Select **All Day**to schedule a full day event.

6.  Provide a date and time for both the event **Start Date** and **End Date**.

    Click the calendar icon to select a date from a calendar. If you are scheduling a full day event, start and end times are not applicable. All times are in 24-hour notation.

7.  Optionally, add existing or create new tags for the event:

    The newly associated tags appear. Click a tag to remove it.

8.  Optionally, select a folder to indicate to users where material related to the event is located:

    1.  In the Documents section, click **Browse**.

    2.  On the Browse docfolder page, navigate the Document Library folder structure and select the appropriate folder.

    3.  Click **OK**.

        The selected path is displayed as a link on the **Add Event** page.

9.  Click **OK**.


The page closes and the calendar displays the scheduled event on the specified day\(s\).
