# Creating a simple search

This task assumes you are in the Search page.

The Search page provides two main areas: the **Query Text**area, where you enter your search criteria, and the **Results options** area, where you select options for how the results will be displayed.

1.  In the Query Text box, type a text string.

    For example, if you have uploaded records to the File Plan that contain recourses details, type resources.

2.  Click ![](../images/rm-resultsoptions.png) Results options.

3.  Select the type of data that you want to return in the Results page.

    1.  In the **Metadata** area, select the metadata fields that you wish to display in the search results. The metadata name becomes a column title in the results table, which can then be sorted.

    2.  In the **Order** area, select the ordering of the search results.

    3.  In the **Components** area, select the type of components to search. For example, if you only want to search for the text in records, ensure that the **Records** check box is selected.

4.  Click **Search**.

    The search results display in a table in the Results tab.
