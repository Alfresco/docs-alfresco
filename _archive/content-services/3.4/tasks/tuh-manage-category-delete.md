# Deleting a category

Delete a category that you no longer want users to be able to access.

Deleting a category deletes its sub-categories and breaks any existing links between content items and the categories being deleted. Only an Administrator can delete a category.

1.  In the toolbar, click ![Administration Console](../images/im-adminconsole.png) **\(Administration Console\)**.

2.  Click **Category Management**.

3.  Navigate to the category you want to delete.

    The page header displays the name of the selected category.

4.  Click ![Delete Category](../images/im-deletecategory.png) **\(Delete Category\)**.

    Deleting a category also deletes its sub-categories. A message informs you if content is linked to the category you are deleting.

    A message prompts you to confirm the deletion of the selected category.

5.  Click **Delete**.

6.  Click **Close** to return to the Administration Console.
