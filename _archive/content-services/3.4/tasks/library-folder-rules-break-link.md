# Breaking the link to a rule set

When a folder is linked to the rule set of another folder, you can break the association at any time. This leaves the folder without rules.

This task assumes you are on the Rules page in the Document Library page component and that the selected folder is linked to the rule set of another folder.

-   Click **Unlink**.

    The link between the current folder and its associated rule set is broken. No actions will be invoked on content items in this folder or space.
