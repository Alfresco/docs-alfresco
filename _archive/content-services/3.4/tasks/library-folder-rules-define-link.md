# Linking to an existing rule set

The **Link to Rule Set** option for a folder with no defined rules enables you to reuse an existing rule set defined for another folder.

This task assumes you are in the Document Library page component of the desired site and you have selected the **Manage Rules** option for a folder with no existing rules.

1.  Click **Link to Rule Set**.

    The Select rule folder to link to page appears.

2.  Select the Destination:

    -   Click **Sites** to link to a folder in a Share site.
    -   Click **Repository** to link to a space in Explorer.
3.  Specify the path, as follows, depending on whether you are copying to a Share site or an Explorer repository:

    -   When linking to a site, click the desired site in the **Site** list. For the **Path**, navigate the folder structure and click the destination folder.
    -   When linking to a repository, navigate the repository structure and click the destination space.
    In both cases, the Rules column displays the existing rule set for the selected folder or space.

    **Note:** Locations that you do not have permission to access are disabled.

4.  Click **Link**.

    The rule set for the selected folder or space is now applied to the current folder.

5.  Click **Done**.
