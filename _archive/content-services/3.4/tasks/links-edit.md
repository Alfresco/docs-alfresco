# Editing a link

Edit an existing link to modify it. Only a Site Manager, a Site Collaborator, and the user who created the link can edit it.

This task assumes you are in the Links page component of the desired site.

1.  In the links list, locate the link you want to edit.

2.  Click **Edit** to the right of that link.

    The Edit Link page appears displaying the selected link.

3.  Make the desired changes to the link details.

4.  Edit the tags for this link as necessary.

    You can add and remove existing tags, or create new tags.

5.  Click **Save**.

    The updated link appears with the **Add Comment** box displayed beneath it.

6.  Click **Links List** to return to the main view.
