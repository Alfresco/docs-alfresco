# Inserting a file into the current document

Use the **Insert File** action to insert the contents of a Word document from the repository directly into the currently open Word document.

1.  Open the Word document you want to work with.

    This can be a document from the repository or any document on your computer.

2.  Place the cursor in the open document at the position you want to insert the content.

3.  On the Browse Spaces and Documents tab of the Alfresco panel, navigate to the document whose contents you want to insert into the open document.

    You can also perform this action on the My Alfresco tab.

4.  Click ![Insert File](../images/MSAddin-insertcontent.png) \(**Insert File into Current Document**\).

    The contents of the selected document are inserted at the current cursor position in your open Word document.
