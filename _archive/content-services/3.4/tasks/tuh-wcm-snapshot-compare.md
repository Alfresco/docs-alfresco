# Comparing snapshots

The **Recent Snapshots** list enables you to compare the content of one snapshot against another within the same web project and compute a list of files that are different between the two snapshots.

1.  Navigate to the Sandbox view of the web project you want to work with.

2.  In the Staging Sandbox, click ![Expand](../images/im-expand.png) to expand the **Recent Snapshots** list.

3.  Select the desired action for the snapshot of interest. The options are:

    -   **Compare to Current Snapshot**
    -   **Compare to Previous Snapshot**
    -   **Compare to Any Snapshot**
    When you choose **Compare to Any Snapshot**, you must select a **Store** and specify the **Version** of the snapshot from that store to compare against. Use the **Previous** and **Next** buttons to select the version number or type the desired version in the box and click **Refresh**.

4.  Click **Close** to return to the Sandbox view.
