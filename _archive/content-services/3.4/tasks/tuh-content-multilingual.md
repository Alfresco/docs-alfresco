# Using multilingual content

Alfresco enables you to store translated versions of content against the native language content item, so the relationship is always maintained. It controls these translations with versioning and other content services.

To use this multilingual feature you must mark the content item as multilingual.

1.  Navigate to the space containing the content item you want to mark as multilingual.

2.  In the Content Items pane, click ![View Details](../images/im-viewdetails.png) **\(View Details\)** for the item of interest.

    The Details page appears.

3.  In the **Actions** list, click **Make Multilingual**.

4.  On the Make Multilingual page, confirm the **Author** of the content.

5.  Select the language into which you would like to transform the document from the list.

6.  Optionally, check **Add translation** when this page closes. You can select one of two options: **With Content** or **Without Content**.

7.  Click **OK**.
