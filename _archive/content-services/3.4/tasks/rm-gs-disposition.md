# Preparing disposition schedules

The next step in the scenario is to prepare a disposition schedule for the records within a category.

The disposition schedule is the life cycle for the cut off, retention period, and disposal of a record. The schedule specifies the duration that records must be retained before they may be disposed of legally.

Disposition schedules are specified at the category level, so the schedules relate to either the folders within the category, or the individual records.

To prepare the disposition schedule, you need to:

1.  Create the general disposition instructions summary.

2.  Add the individual disposition steps.

3.  Apply the disposition schedule to either a folder or record.


-   **[Disposition schedules](../concepts/rm-dispschedule.md)**  
Disposition schedules are a key function of the records management system. The disposition schedule defines the procedures required for maintaining records in the records management system until their eventual destruction or transfer to another location.
-   **[Creating a disposition schedule](../tasks/rm-gs-dispschedule-create.md)**  
The disposition schedule must be defined at a record category level. The procedure for creating a disposition schedule is a two part process: the first part is to create a summary of the schedule; the second part is to create the steps in the schedule.
