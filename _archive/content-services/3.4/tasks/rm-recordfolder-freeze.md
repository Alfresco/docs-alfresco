# Freezing record folders

Users with the appropriate capability \(Extend Retention Period Or Freeze\) may freeze any number of records or folders. A **Hold** allows objects frozen for a particular reason to be tracked as a set. Holds prevent changes to frozen objects, and they have their retention schedules suspended until the hold is removed.

1.  Navigate to the list of record folders.

2.  In the item list, position the cursor over the folder of interest to display the available actions.

3.  Click **Freeze**.

    A message displays confirming that the folder is frozen.


The record is placed into the space named **Hold**.
