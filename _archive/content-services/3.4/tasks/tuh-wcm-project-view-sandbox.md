# Displaying the Sandbox view

Each user associated with a web project has their own space, called a sandbox, which contains the existing web project content. Within the sandbox the user manages the content independently from changes made by other users.

The sandboxes available for you to view depend upon your assigned role. Content Managers and Content Publishers can view the Staging Sandbox, their own sandbox, and all user sandboxes. Content Contributors and Content Reviewers see only the Staging Sandbox and their own sandbox. Your personal sandbox is labelled **My Sandbox**. By default, only the Staging Sandbox and your user sandbox appear in the Sandbox view. When available, select the option **Show All Sandboxes** in this view to display all sandboxes available to you.

1.  Use one of the following two methods to navigate to the Web Projects space \(**Company Home** \> **Web Projects**\) to display the existing web projects.

    -   Click ![View Details](../images/im-viewdetails.png) **\(View Details\)** for the web project of interest in the **Browse Spaces** pane.
    -   Click the name of the web project you want to view to display the Sandbox view. In the **Actions** menu, click **View Details**.
2.  In the **Browse Spaces** pane, click the name of the web project you want to view. Alternately, click ![Web Project](../images/im-webproject.png) to the left of the desired web project.
