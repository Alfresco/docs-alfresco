# Adding items to the library

Adding content items from your computer to a site’s document library is a simple process. Share allows you to upload individual files or several files at a time.

This task assumes you are in the Document Library page component of the desired site.

The first step in adding an item to your site’s library is to determine where you want it to reside. The **Library** section of the browsing pane in the Document Library page component displays the available folders. Create a new folder if necessary.

1.  Navigate the library’s folder structure and click the folder where the item\(s\) being uploaded will reside.

2.  Click **Upload**.

    The Upload File\(s\) page appears.

3.  Click the browse button.

4.  Locate the file\(s\) on your computer that you want to upload and click **Open**.

    Select multiple items using the method appropriate for your operating system.

    The selected items appear in the list. Click **Remove** to delete an item from this list, if necessary.

5.  Repeat steps 3 and 4 to select additional items to upload.

6.  Click **Upload File\(s\)** when this list contains all items you want to upload.

    An indicator informs you of the upload progress. When 100% displays for all files, you can proceed.

7.  Click **OK**.


The page closes and the item list for the specified folder displays the uploaded content item\(s\).
