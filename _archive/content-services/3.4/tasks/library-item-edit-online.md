# Editing your Microsoft Office documents online

The **Edit Online** feature enables you to edit your document without first saving it offline \(checking it out\). An invisible check-out action ensures your document remains protected, or locked, in the Document Library during the editing session. Upon closing the document, the document is invisibly checked in with the updated version available to other users.

This task assumes you are in the Document Library page component of the desired site.

1.  Navigate the libraryâ€™s folder structure to locate the Microsoft Office document you want to edit.

2.  In the item list, position the cursor over the item of interest to display the available actions.

3.  Click **More** and then **Edit Online**.

    If the **Edit Online** action does not appear, ensure:

    -   You are viewing Share within Internet Explorer.
    -   You are modifying an Office 2003 or greater file.
    If you still cannot see the **Edit Online** action, contact your System Administrator to enable it for you.

    A warning box appears prompting you to be sure the content can be trusted.

4.  Click **OK** to open the document.

    **Note:** If prompted for login credentials, type your user name and password, then click **OK**.

    The document opens in a separate window. In the Document Library page component, refresh the page to see the lock icon associated with the file.

    **Important:** If the file opens in Read-Only format, contact your System Administrator.

5.  Modify the file as necessary.

6.  Save and close the document.


This updates the document in the Document Library with your changes.
