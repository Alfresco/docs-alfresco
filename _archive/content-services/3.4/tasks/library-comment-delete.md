# Deleting a comment

Delete a comment to permanently remove it from a folder or individual content item. Only a Site Manager and the user who created the comment can delete it.

This task assumes you are in the Document Library page component of the desired site.

1.  Locate and view the content containing the comment you want to delete.

2.  Click **Delete** to the right of the comment you want to remove.

    This action is available only when the currently logged in user has permission to delete the comment.

    A message prompts you to confirm the deletion of the selected comment.

3.  Click **Delete**.

    A message indicates the selected comment has been deleted.
