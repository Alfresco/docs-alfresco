# Selecting an image to accompany an article

Associate an image with an article to have it appear alongside the article on various pages of the Quick Start website.

This task assumes you are in the Document Library page component of the Quick Start site and that the **Show Folders** feature is enabled.

1.  Navigate to **Alfresco Quick Start \> Quick Start Editorial \> root \> news \> companies**.

2.  Click **Edit Metadata** in the action list for the item **article1.html**.

3.  On the Details for article1.html page click **Full Metadata Edit page** in the upper right corner to display all metadata for this article.

    The item **article\_image1.jpg** beneath the **Primary Image** label indicates the image currently associated with the selected article.

4.  Click **Select** beneath the **Primary Image** label to associate a different graphic with the news article.

    The button at the top of the repository structure indicates your current location in the repository. Click this button to display the full path; click a location in the path to return to that point. Click the up arrow to return to the previous level in the hierarchy.

5.  Locate and add the desired image as follows:

    1.  In the right column, click the **Remove** icon to the right of the currently selected image to remove it.

    2.  Navigate the structure in the left column to locate the image you wish to associate with the new article.

        **Note:** For this example, you will select from the images currently available in the demo Share site. To add your own image, you must first upload it from your computer to the site.

    3.  Click **Add** to the right of the image you wish to associate with the carousel.

    4.  Click **OK** to save the changes.

    **Note:** There are currently no templates that make use of the secondary image. However, users creating templates for their own websites may choose to use this feature.

6.  Click **Save**.

    On the Quick Start website, navigate to the Home page to view the changes. Refresh the page if the changes are not immediately visible.
