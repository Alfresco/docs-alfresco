# Viewing a workflow

From the Workflows I’ve Started page, you can view the full details of a workflow, including a workflow summary, details on the most recently completed task, and a summary of all tasks generated by the workflow.

Although you can cancel a workflow directly from the workflow list, viewing the workflow enables you to confirm you have selected the correct one before you cancel it.

This task assumes you are on the Workflows I've Started page.

1.  In the workflow list, position the cursor over the workflow of interest to display the available actions.

2.  Click **View Workflow**.

    **Note:** Alternatively, click the workflow title.

    The Details page appears displaying the information for the selected workflow.

    -   Click **View Current Tasks** at the top of the page to jump to the Current Tasks section. This table displays the tasks generated from the selected workflow. Use the actions provided to manage the task.
    -   In the Items list, click an item to preview it in the Details page of the Document Library page component. Click your browser’s Back button to return to the Workflow Details page.
    -   Click **Cancel Workflow** to cancel the workflow. This action is available only to the user who started the workflow.
3.  Click **Workflows I’ve Started** beneath the banner to return to the workflow list.
