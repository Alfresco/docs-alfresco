# Performing actions on multiple list items

Once you select the list items you want to work with, you can select an action to perform.

This task assumes you are in the Data Lists page component of the desired site, a list is displayed, and you have selected the items you want to work with.

The **Selected Items** list in the header displays the actions available to be performed on multiple items. They are:

-   **Duplicate**

    Copies the selected list items and adds them to the current list.

-   **Delete**

    Deletes the selected list items.

-   **Deselect All**

    Clears the check boxes of the currently selected list items.


To perform an action on the selected list items:

1.  Click **Selected Items** in the header.

    A list displays the available actions.

2.  Click the desired action.

    Click **Deselect All** to clear the selected items. When you select this option, you cannot perform another action until you reselect the desired list items.
