# Editing a wiki page

Edit a wiki page to create new content, edit existing content, and add tags.

This task assumes you are in the Wiki page component of the desired site.

You add and edit wiki content in a simple browser. You can perform this task from both the wiki list and the page view.

1.  In the wiki list, locate the wiki page you want to edit.

2.  Click **Edit** for that page.

    If the wiki page you want to edit is already open in the page view, simply click **Edit Page**.

    The content of the selected wiki page displays in an editing box.

3.  Make the desired changes to the content.

    Use the features provided to format the text; insert bulleted and numbered lists; color the text and background; and insert or edit links, anchors, and images. To assist with editing, use the undo, redo, and remove formatting features as needed. Additional functionality includes the ability to insert and customize tables; insert the current date and time; and view the editor in fullscreen mode. Position the cursor over an icon to display its function.

    The **Insert Image Library** feature displays a list of images in the Document Library page component of the current site. Click a thumbnail in this list to insert the related image into the wiki page at the current cursor position.

    Click and drag the bottom right corner to resize the text editor.

    To create a link to another wiki page, type **\[\[Page Name\]\]**. If the page indicated does not exist, Share creates it; however, this is an empty wiki page and it will not appear in the wiki list until you select **Edit Page** and provide content for it.

4.  Edit the tags for this wiki page as necessary.

    You can add and remove existing tags, or create new tags.

5.  Click **Save**.


The page view displays the updated wiki page.
