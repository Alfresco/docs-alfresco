# Searching for empty strings

An example of searching for empty strings is to match all the empty Location fields.

1.  In the Query Text box, enter:

    `location:””`

2.  In the Results options area, select the checkbox for **Records**.

3.  Click **Search**.


The Results page shows the records that have empty Location fields.
