# Adding groups to a site

To save yourself time inviting multiple users individually to join a site, you can add existing user groups to the current site. This process involves searching for the group, assigning a role to the group as a whole, and then adding the group. Unlike inviting users, no invitation is extended; the group is added immediately. The available user roles are Manager, Collaborator, Contributor, and Consumer.

This task assumes you are in the Members page component of the desired site.

1.  Click **Groups** beneath the banner if this page is not already selected.

2.  Click **Add Groups**.

3.  Search for and add groups.

    1.  In the **Find Groups to add to this site** box, type the full or partial name of the group you want to add. You must enter a minimum of one \(1\) character. The search is not case sensitive.

    2.  Click **Search**.

        The application displays a list of all groups matching the specified search criteria.

    3.  Click **Add** to the right of a group in this list.

        The group appears in the **Add these Groups** box.

4.  In the **Add these Groups** box, specify a role for each user.

    -   To set the role for a group, click **Select Role** to the right of the group and click the desired role.
    -   To set the same role for all groups in the list, click **Set All Roles to** at the top of the list and click the desired role.
5.  Click **Add Groups** to add all groups displayed in the list.
