# Inviting users to a web project

The Invite Web Project Users feature enables you to add users to an existing web project and assign roles to them.

You can invite both individual users and user groups to a web project. Each user invited to a web project is given a sandbox for web content development. When you add a group, each user within that group is given a sandbox.

To change the role of a user already associated with the web project, you must delete the userâ€™s sandbox and then add the user again with the appropriate role assigned.

1.  Navigate to the Sandbox view of the web project you want to work with.

2.  In the **Actions** menu, click **Invite Web Project Users**.

    The Invite Web Project Users page opens.

3.  In Step One, Invite Users, select the users you want to add to this web project and assign roles to them.

    1.  Select **Users** or **Groups**. In the search box, type the full or partial name of the user/group you want to add and click **Search**.

        Leave the search box empty and click **Search** to return a list of all users. Selecting to display all users may take some time if there are many users in the system.

    2.  In the **Results** list, click to select the users/groups to invite.

        Use SHIFT to select multiple, consecutive items; use CTRL to select multiple, non-consecutive items. Select multiple users/groups only when you want to assign them the same role.

    3.  In the **Role** list, click a role for the selected user\(s\)/group\(s\).

    4.  Click **Add to List**.

        Click ![Remove](../images/im-delete.png) **\(Remove\)** to remove a user from the list.

    5.  Add additional invitees in the same manner, as required.

4.  Click **Next** once all users/groups have been added.

5.  In Step Two, Notify Users, choose one of the following options:

    -   Click **No** if you do not want the invited users to be notified of the invitation by email.
    -   Click **Yes** if you want the invited users to be notified of the invitation by email, then complete the **Subject** and **Message** boxes. You can write your own message, or select a template from the **User Template** menu and click **Insert Template**.
6.  Click **Next**.

7.  In Step Three, Summary, review the information and click **Finish**.
