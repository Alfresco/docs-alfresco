# Performing an advanced search

The search feature located in the toolbar provides access to the advanced search form. Use the advanced search to search for content by field, mimetype, modifier, or modification date span.

1.  Expand the menu on the left side of the search field and click **Advanced Search**.

    The Advanced Search page displays.

2.  Select the type of search you are performing:

    -   **Content**: Searches for all types of content
    -   **Folders**: Searches for all folders and containers, such as content folders \(Document Library component\) and lists \(Data Lists component\)
3.  Specify the search criteria as desired.

    **Note:** The query syntax is based on the fts-alfresco Full Text Search \(FTS\) language, which is based on elements from the Lucene and SQL languages.

    To search by modification date, click the calendar icon to select a date from a calendar.

    To search by the user who last modified the content, enter the appropriate user name in the **Modifier** field.

4.  Click **Search**.

    The results page displays the matches found.

5.  Click the thumbnail or content name link in the results list to display that piece of content in its appropriate site.
