# Customizing Document Library services

The following tasks involve customizations to the Document Library services in the Alfresco repository.

-   **[Adding a custom workflow to the Alfresco repository](../tasks/kb-code-workflow.md)**  
Adding a custom workflow to the Alfresco repository includes a process definition file and a workflow bootstrap file. The latter comprises a Spring bean that informs the Alfresco repository of the new workflow process definition.
-   **[Adding an archive action handler](../tasks/kb-code-actionhandler.md)**  
Introduce a custom web script that acts as an HTTP POST handler for your archive action.
-   **[Setting up the kb:article aspect](../tasks/kb-code-kbaspect.md)**  
This tells the document library to make your custom `kb:article` aspect visible.
