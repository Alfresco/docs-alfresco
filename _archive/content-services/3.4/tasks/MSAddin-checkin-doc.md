# Checking in a document

Once you complete your edits on a checked out document, you must check in the working copy to update the original in the repository.

1.  In the **My Checked Out Documents** list on the My Alfresco tab of the Alfresco panel, locate the file you want to check in.

    This action is also available in the **Documents** list on the Browse Spaces and Documents tab.

2.  Click ![Check In](../images/MSAddin-checkinbutton.png) \(**Check In**\) for the document of interest.

    The document is checked in and removed from the **My Checked Out Documents** list on this tab.
