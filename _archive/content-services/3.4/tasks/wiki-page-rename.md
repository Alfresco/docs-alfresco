# Renaming a wiki page

You rename a wiki page in the page view.

This task assumes you are in the Wiki page component of the desired site.

When you rename a wiki page, the updated page retains the page history. Share creates a new page with the original page name; this page links to the updated page.

1.  In the wiki list, locate the wiki page you want to rename.

2.  Click the title of that page.

    The page view displays the selected wiki page.

3.  Click **Rename**.

    The Rename page opens.

4.  Type the new name for the wiki page.

    The wiki page title does not support the following special characters: \* < \> \\ / . ? : and \|. When the entry contains a disallowed character, the **Save** button is disabled.

5.  Click **Save**.


The page view reflects the name change and this wiki page retains the page history of the original page. Share creates a new page with the original page name, which links to the updated page.
