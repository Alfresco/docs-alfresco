# Editing an item inline

The **Inline Edit** action enables you to edit plain text, HTML, and XML content items that were created using the **Create Content** feature in a site’s document library. This action is also available for content items configured with the aspect *Inline Editable*.

This task assumes you are in the Document Library page component of the desired site.

1.  Navigate the library’s folder structure to locate the content item you want to edit.

2.  In the item list, position the cursor over the item of interest to display the available actions.

3.  Click **More** and then click **Inline Edit**.

    This action appears only for content items created using the **Create Content** feature within the library.

    The Edit Content page appears.

4.  Edit the item details and content as desired.

    The **Name** does not support the following special characters: \* < \> \\ / . ? : and \|. When the name contains a disallowed character, the **Save** button is disabled.

5.  Click **Save**.
