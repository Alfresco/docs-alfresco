# Defining a content model for metadata

A content model for Knowledge Base metadata requires a namespace URI and prefix.

1.  Define a namespace URI.

    For example:

    http://www.alfresco.org/model/knowledgebase/1.0

2.  Define a prefix to use.

    For example:

    `kb`

    The prefix must be unique and should be short.


With a URI and prefix, you can reference anything you define in the model using the `kb` prefix. This lets you define things inside the model, such as Knowledge Base spaces and articles.

-   **[Defining a Knowledge Base space](../tasks/kb-space-define.md)**  
 Knowledge Base articles are authored and managed in a Knowledge Base space. An Alfresco space is a container that behaves like a folder, but can include custom business logic and behavior.
-   **[Defining Knowledge Base articles](../tasks/kb-article-define.md)**  
A Knowledge Base article is a document, such as a Word document, PDF, or text file submitted by a knowledge expert. You can define metadata to wrap this Knowledge Base article for storing things on the document that are not part of the documentâ€™s internal representation, such as an internal representation of the lifecycle state \(draft, pending approval, and so on\), or a field that indicates the type of document.
-   **[Applying property constraints](../tasks/kb-constraints-apply.md)**  
Property constraints let you specify checks that must pass before the property value is considered valid and safe for persistence. Constraints fire when the property values change. A content item must have all of its constraints pass before it can be created or saved.
