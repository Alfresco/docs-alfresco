# Declaring a record

The next step is to declare a record. Filed items are not considered to be part of the Records Management system until they have been declared as records. When you file an item, Alfresco creates an undeclared record profile but it is not automatically considered to be a record.

The process of including a record in the Records Management system involves:

1.  Applying detailed metadata to the item.

2.  Declaring the item as a record.


-   **[Editing metadata](../tasks/rm-gs-editmetadata.md)**  
Records have mandatory metadata. You must complete the mandatory metadata before you can declare a record.
-   **[Declaring a record](../tasks/rm-gs-declarerecord.md)**  
The next step is to declare the item as a record.
