# Search using wildcards

An example of a simple wildcard query is to match any word starting with 'war' in any record name, title, description, or content.

1.  In the Query Text box, enter:

    `keywords:war*`

2.  In the Results options area, select the checkbox for Records.


The single and multiple wildcard characters can be combined as needed. For example, "warshi?" and "\*ship" and "\*sh??" all match "warship".
