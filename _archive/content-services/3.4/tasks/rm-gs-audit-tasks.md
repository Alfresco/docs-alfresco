# Auditing tasks

You use the Audit tool user interface to filter the audit log results to display the required details. You can then save the audit log results, either filed as a record, or exported to an HTML file.

1.  To change the audit log details, for example, to change the audit log time:

    1.  Type a start date in the **From** field or click the calendar icon to select a date.

    2.  Type an end date in the **To** field or click the calendar icon to select a date.

    3.  Click **Apply**.

        The audit log results change to display only those events that occurred between the specified dates.

2.  To specify the user:

    By default, the audit log displays the activity for all users.

    1.  Click **Specify**.

    2.  Type the full or partial name of the user you want to find.

        You must enter a minimum of three \(3\) characters. The search is not case sensitive.

    3.  Click **Add**.

        The audit log displays the actions taken by the specified user.

3.  To file the audit log as a record:

    1.  Click **File as Record**.

        The **Select** location of Audit Record window displays.

    2.  Choose the destination folder for the audit record.

    3.  Click **OK**.

        The audit log appears as an undeclared record in the selected folder in the File Plan.

4.  To export the audit log:

    1.  Click **Export**.

        The export log is stored as an HTML file.

    2.  Save the file to your machine.

5.  To start and stop auditing:

    1.  Click **Stop**.

        The auditing tool stops capturing and storing the activity in the Records Management system.

    2.  Click **Start** to start the audit log again.
