# Accessing the Wiki page component

Accessing the Wiki page component gives you access to all wiki content. Within the wiki you can create, delete, rename, and edit the wiki pages. You can perform most actions from both the wiki list and the page view.

1.  Enter the desired site.

2.  On the banner, click **Wiki**.

    The Wiki page component appears, displaying the main wiki page for this site in the page view. In this view, the actions you can perform on the current wiki page appear as buttons beneath the banner \(**New Page**, **Delete**, **Rename**\) and as links at the top right of the content area \(**View Page**, **Edit Page**, **Details**\).

3.  Click **Wiki Page List**to display the wiki list.

    The wiki list displays a summary of all pages in the wiki for the current site. In this view, the actions you can perform on a wiki page appear as buttons beneath the banner \(only **New Page** is available in this view\) and as links to the right of each page summary.
