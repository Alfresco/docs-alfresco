# Viewing a folder in Alfresco Explorer

The **View in Alfresco Explorer**action displays the selected folder in the Alfresco Explorer web client, providing access to all relevant actions.

This task assumes you are in the Document Library page component of the desired site. The **Show Folders** feature must be enabled.

1.  In the item list, position the cursor over the folder of interest to display the available actions.

2.  Click **More** and then **View in Alfresco Explorer**.

    A new browser window opens displaying the Alfresco Explorer login page. You must log in to the Explorer client the first time you use this action.

3.  If prompted, provide the appropriate **User Name** and **Password**, then click **Login**.


Alfresco Explorer displays the details page for the selected folder.
