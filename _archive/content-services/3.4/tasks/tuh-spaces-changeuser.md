# Changing users' roles for a space

Users and groups can have multiple roles within a space. You can add, change, and remove those roles as needed.

1.  Navigate to the space whose users you want to manage.

    The space header displays the name and details of the selected space.

2.  In the **More Actions** menu, click **Manage Space Users**.

3.  On the Manage Space Users page, click ![Change Roles](../images/im-user-modify.png) **\(Change Roles\)** for the user or group whose role you want to change.

    In this list, the icon ![User](../images/im-user.png) to the left of the name indicates a user; the icon ![Group](../images/im-group.png) indicates a group.

4.  On the Modify User Rolespage, change the roles for the selected user or group as follows:

    1.  To assign a new role to the selected user or group, click a role in the **Select role**list and click **Add to List**.

    2.  To delete the role assigned to the selected user or group, click ![Remove](../images/im-delete.png) **\(Remove\)** for that role in the **Selected roles** list.

5.  Click **OK** to save the changes.

6.  Click **Close** to return to the current space.
