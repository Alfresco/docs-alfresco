# Browsing the library

The browsing feature in the Document Library page component enables you to filter the items displayed in the item list. This allows you to more easily navigate the library contents.

This task assumes you are in the Document Library page component of the desired site.

The browsing pane on the left side of the page enables you to display a subset of the library items by selecting a specific view, a folder, or a tag.

The **Documents** list in the browsing pane provides the following views for browsing library content:

-   **All Documents**

    Displays all items in the Document Library

-   **I'm Editing**

    Displays the items checked out by the current user

-   **Others are Editing**

    Displays the items checked out by other site members

-   **Recently Modified**

    Displays items modified in the past seven days

-   **Recently Added**

    Displays items added to the library in the past seven days

-   **My Favorites**

    Displays the items marked as favorites


The **Library** section displays the folder structure in a tree view. The symbol ![](../images/Subfolders.png) indicates a library folder contains subfolders.

The **Tags** list displays all tags currently associated with one or more items. The number in parentheses following a tag indicates the number of items in the library that reference the tag.

To browse the Document Library items:

1.  Select the desired option in the browsing pane:

    1.  In the **Documents** list, click the view representing the items you want to view. The item list displays all items in the current site that correspond to the selection.

    2.  In the **Library** section, navigate the tree and click a folder to display the items it contains.

        The Breadcrumb Path located above the content item list displays your current position within the folder structure. Each breadcrumb item is a link, allowing easy access to any part of the current navigation path. The breadcrumbs allow you to return to any folder in the current path without having to repeat all the steps:

        -   Click a link to return to the corresponding folder.
        -   Click **Up** to display the contents of the folder one level higher.
        -   Click **Hide Breadcrumb** to collapse the breadcrumb path.
        -   Click **Show Breadcrumb** to display it again.
    3.  In the **Tags** list, click the tag of interest. The item list displays all items in this siteâ€™s library associated with the selected tag.

2.  Click the **Simple View** icon to display only basic item details.

    Click the **Detailed View** icon to display the summary view.

3.  Position the cursor over an item in this list to display its available actions.
