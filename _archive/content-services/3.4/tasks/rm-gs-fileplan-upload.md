# Filing items to the File Plan

The next step is to file some items into your File Plan structure. When you upload content into Alfresco, you need to specify whether it is stored electronically and is available for you to upload, or whether the item is in non-electronic form and is stored in a physical location.

1.  In the File Plan page, navigate to the folder into which you wish to upload the file.

    Select a folder that is within a category that has an associated disposition schedule.

2.  Click **File**.

    The Filing Type page displays.

3.  Indicate whether the item you are filing is either an electronic record or non-electronic record. Select either:

    -   **Electronic Record**, or
    -   **Non-electronic Record**

The page that displays depends on the option that you select.

-   **[Filing an electronic record](../tasks/rm-electronic-file.md)**  
Electronic records are files that are uploaded into the Alfresco Records Management repository.
-   **[Filing a non-electronic record](../tasks/rm-nonelect-file.md)**  
Non-electronic records may be paper files or papers that can be stored in a physical location. The non-electronic record in Alfresco Records Management provides a record of the existence of the file and the details of where it is physically stored.
