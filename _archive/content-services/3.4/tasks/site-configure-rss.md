# Configuring the site dashboard RSS feed

You can configure the RSS Feed site dashlet to display any RSS feed on a site dashboard.

To perform this task, you must first customize your site dashboard to display the Alfresco Global Feed dashlet. This appears as the RSS Feed dashlet on the **Customize Site Dashboard** page.

The steps to configure the RSS Feed dashlet on a site dashboard are the same as for your personal dashboard.
