# Locating items and folders

When you filter library content using one of the browsing views provided, such as the **I'm Editing** or **My Favorites** view, it is not possible to tell where in the folder structure an item or folder resides. The **Locate File** and **Locate Folder** actions enable you to reveal the actual location of an item or folder in the library.

This task assumes you are in the Document Library page component of the desired site and a view \(**All Documents**, **I'm Editing**, **Others are Editing**, **Recently Modified**, **Recently Added**, or **My Favorites**\) is selected in the browsing pane. To view the location of a folder, the **Show Folders** feature must be enabled.

1.  In the item list, position the cursor over the item or folder of interest to display the available actions.

2.  Click **More** and then click **Locate File** or **Locate Folder**, depending on your selection.


The document library displays the selected folder or item as it exists in the library. The Library tree in the browsing pane displays the current location, as does the breadcrumb path at the top of the page.
