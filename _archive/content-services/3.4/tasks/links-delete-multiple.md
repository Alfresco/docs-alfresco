# Deleting multiple links

In the links list, select multiple links using the check boxes to the left of each link or the **Select** feature at the top of the links list. This enables you to quickly delete multiple links, rather than removing them one at a time.

This task assumes you are in the Links page component of the desired site.

1.  In the browsing pane, select a view or tag to display the desired links.

2.  In the links list, select the links to delete:

    -   Click the check box to left of each link you want to delete.
    -   Click **Select** at the top of the list and click **All** to select all links in the current view.
    Click **None** to clear the list selections. Click **Invert Selection** to toggle the check boxes to their opposite state.

    The check boxes of the specified links appear selected in the links list.

3.  Click **Selected Items** in the header.

    A list displays the available actions.

4.  Click **Delete**.

    Click **Deselect All** to clear the selected links.

    A message prompts you to confirm the deletion of the selected links.

5.  Click **Delete**.


A message indicates the selected links have been deleted.
