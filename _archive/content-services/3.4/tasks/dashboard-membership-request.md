# Managing site membership requests

In addition to displaying upcoming and overdue tasks, the **My Tasks** dashlet enables the Site Manager to manage requests from users to join a public site that has moderated site membership.

To view and manage these requests, you must first configure your personal dashboard to display the **My Tasks** personal dashlet.

1.  Click **My Dashboard** on the toolbar.

    The **My Tasks** personal dashlet displays all tasks and membership requests.

2.  To display only the site membership requests, click **Invites**.

3.  Review the requests and select the appropriate action for each:

    -   Click **Approve** to accept the user as a member of the specified site. The user is added with the role Consumer.
    -   Click **Reject** to prohibit the user from becoming a member of the specified site.
