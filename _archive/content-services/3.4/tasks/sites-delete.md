# Deleting a site

Delete a site to permanently remove it from the repository. Deleting a site also deletes all site content, including the Document Library content, Wiki pages, Blog posts, Calendar events, Links entries, and Discussion topics. Only a Site Manager can delete a site.

1.  On the toolbar, expand the **Sites** menu and click **Search for Sites**.

    The Site Finder page component appears.

2.  Perform a search.

    The results list appears beneath the search box. If you have permission to delete a site, the **Delete** button displays for that site.

3.  Click **Delete** for the site you want to delete.

    A message prompts you to confirm the deletion.

4.  Click **Delete** to delete the selected site.

    A message informs you that the selected action deletes all site content.

5.  Click **Yes**.


The selected site is deleted in its entirety.
