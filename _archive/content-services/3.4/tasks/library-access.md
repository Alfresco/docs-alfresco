# Accessing the Document Library page component

Accessing the Document Library page component enables you to view all content items for the current site. Within the library, you can view, upload, edit, and delete items. You can also add comments to an item and edit its metadata.

1.  Enter the desired site.

2.  On the banner, click **Document Library**.

    The Document Library page component appears. The content item list displays a summary of the items in the root folder, Documents, which is the default selection in the browsing pane. The item summary includes:

    -   a thumbnail of the content
    -   the item title
    -   the date and time the item was uploaded to or modified within the site
    -   the user who added or last modified the item
    -   the version number \(set to 1.0 when a new item is uploaded\)
    -   the file size
    -   a description
    -   the tags associated with the item
    Where a view contains more items than can be displayed on a single page, the **Previous** and **Next** links at both the top and bottom of the content item list become enabled.

3.  Click **Show Folders** to display both folders and content items in this list.

    Click **Hide Folders** to display only the content items.

4.  Click the **Simple View** icon to display only basic item details \(title, modification date and time, user responsible for the modifications\) for the content items.

    Click the **Detailed View** icon to display the summary view.
