# Viewing scheduled events

The My Calendar personal dashlet summarizes the scheduled items from all sites with which you are associated. It contains a rolled up view of events that you have created, as well as events for each site you are associated with, either as a member or as the Site Manager.

To view the events, you must first configure your personal dashboard to display the My Calendar personal dashlet.

1.  Click **My Dashboard** on the toolbar if your personal dashboard is not already displayed.

    The My Calendar personal dashlet displays the name, date, and time of each event, as well as the site in which it was created.

2.  From the My Calendar dashlet, view additional information about an event:

    -   Click the event name to display the Calendar page component where the event was created. This is a convenient way to access and edit events you created.
    -   Click the site name to display the corresponding site dashboard.
