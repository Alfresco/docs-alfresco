# Editing a Knowledge Base article

Modify the properties of a Knowledge Base article in Alfresco Explorer.

1.  In your Knowledge Base space in Alfresco Explorer, locate the content item you want to edit, for example, **Article1.txt**, and click its View Details icon.

    The Details page lists all the properties of the content item. If you previously used `kb:articletype` and `kb:status properties`, they will appear exactly as you instructed.
