# Overriding the launch

The **Submit Now** action enables you to process the pending launch immediately rather than waiting for the specified launch date and time.

Performing this task immediately promotes the content set from the **Content Awaiting Launch** list to staging. You will not be prompted to confirm this action.

1.  Navigate to the Sandbox view of the web project you want to work with.

2.  Click ![Expand](../images/im-expand.png) to expand the **Content Awaiting Launch** list.

3.  Click ![Submit Now](../images/im-submitnow.png) **\(Submit Now\)** to immediately promote the content set to staging.

    A new snapshot appears at the top of the **Recent Snapshots** list. The related content is cleared from the **Modified Items** list in your sandbox.
