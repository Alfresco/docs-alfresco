# Creating a folder structure

The **Library** section of the browsing pane displays the folder structure for the current site. A new site contains only the root folder, **Documents**. Add new folders beneath the root to create the siteâ€™s folder structure.

This task assumes you are in the Document Library page component of the desired site.

1.  In the **Library** section of the browsing pane, navigate the tree and click to select the location of the new folder.

    The new folder will be created as a subfolder of the folder highlighted in the tree.

2.  Click **New Folder**.

    The **New Folder** page appears.

3.  Type a **Name** for the folder.

    This is the name that will appear in the tree. The folder name does not support the following special characters: \* < \> \\ / . ? : and \|. When the name contains a disallowed character, the **OK** button is disabled.

4.  Type a **Title** and **Description** for the folder.

5.  Click **OK**.


The page closes and the new folder appears in its appropriate position in the tree.
