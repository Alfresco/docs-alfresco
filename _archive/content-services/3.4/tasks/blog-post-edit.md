# Editing a blog post

Edit an existing blog post to modify or add to its content. Only a Site Manager, a Site Collaborator, and the user who created the blog post can edit it.

This task assumes you are in the Blog page component of the desired site.

1.  In the post list, locate the blog post you want to edit.

2.  Click **Edit**.

    Optionally, open the post to perform this action.

    The Edit Blog Post page appears displaying the selected post.

3.  Make the desired changes to the post title and content.

    Use the features provided to format the text; insert bulleted and numbered lists; color the text and background; and insert or edit links, anchors, and images. To assist with editing, use the undo, redo, and remove formatting features as needed. Additional features are also provided; position the cursor over an icon to display its function.

    Click and drag the bottom right corner to resize the text editor.

4.  Edit the tags for this post as necessary.

    You can add and remove existing tags, or create new tags.

5.  Save or publish the updated blog post:

    -   Click **Update** to save the changes.
    -   Click **Publish Internally** to save the changes and publish the post to the internal blog, making it available for other site members. This option appears only for draft posts.
    -   Click **Update Internally and Publish Externally** to publish the post to both the internal and external blogs.
    The updated post appears as users will see it. The text \(Updated\) appears after the title.

6.  Click **Blog Post List** to return to the main view.
