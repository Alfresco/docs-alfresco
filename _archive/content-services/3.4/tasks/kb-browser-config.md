# Designing for browser dependencies

A web script requires a descriptor file, a scriptable controller, and template view, but you can also define extra elements. A dashlet can render HTML compliant markup and allow the Alfresco Share framework to assert the proper CSS used to decorate the dashlet. However, if a dashlet wants to use CSS includes or browser-side JavaScript, it must inform the web framework to inject specific dependencies into the HTML `<head>` tag. Spring Surf lets your web scripts declare these kinds of dependencies.

To define browser-side dependencies for JavaScript or CSS \(generally, part of the HTML `<head>` tag\), add an additional template file for injecting these dependencies into the proper place in the total page markup that renders back to the browser.

1.  Create a template file, for example, knowledgebase.get.head.ftl.

    ```
    title.current=Current articles
    title.drafts=Draft articles
    title.pendingApprovals=Articles pending for approval
    title.archived=Archived articles
    ```

2.  Define what goes into the HTML `<head>` tag. For example:

    ```
    <#include "../component.head.inc"> 
    
    <!-- Knowledge Base--> 
    <@link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" 
      href="${page.url.context}-extension/components/knowledgebase/knowledgebase.css" /> 
    <@script type="text/javascript" 
      src="${page.url.context}-extension/components/knowledgebase/knowledgebase.js"> 
    </@script> 
    
    <!-- Tag Library --> 
    <@link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" 
      href="${page.url.context}/modules/taglibrary/taglibrary.css" /> 
    <@script type="text/javascript" 
      src="${page.url.context}/modules/taglibrary/taglibrary.js"> 
    </@script> 
    ```

    **Note:**

    The `.head` naming convention tells Surf to execute this template before the web scriptâ€™s view template. Its output will be stitched into the XHTML compliant `<head>` tag. This HEAD generation template has full access to the model generated by the scriptable controller. Thus, the `<head>` tag for your web script can be dynamic and based on the model established by the controller.

    The Surf engine recognizes this and includes your HTML HEAD markup in the FreeMarker `${head}` variable, which is injected into the `<head>` tag of the overall HTML received by the browser.
