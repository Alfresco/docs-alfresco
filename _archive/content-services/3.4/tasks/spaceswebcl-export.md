# Exporting spaces in Explorer

You can export any spaces and content in Alfresco Explorer to which you have access. However, you can only import and export from the same version.

1.  In Alfresco Explorer, browse to the space you want to export.

2.  To export the space, either:

    -   Click the **Administration Console** icon, and then click **Export**, or
    -   Click **View Details**, and in the **Actions** list, click **Export**
3.  In Package Name, specify a name for the file.

4.  Choose **Click here to select the destination**.

5.  Navigate the spaces to select a destination space for your file.

6.  Select the **Current space** option.

7.  Check at least one of the boxes for **Include Children** and **Include this Space**.

    *Children* means everything that you see in the Browse Spaces and Content Items panes.

8.  Optionally, check **Run export in background**.

9.  Click **OK**.

10. Click **Close**.

    Browse to the space that you specified as the destination to see the .acp export file.

    **Note:** After exporting an ACP file, you should move it to a secure location.
