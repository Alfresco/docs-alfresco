# Starting a new workflow against a document

Use the workflow feature to attach workflow directly to a document and then assign the document to another user for review. Two preconfigured workflows are available: Adhoc Task \(for assigning a task to a colleague\) and Review & Approve \(for setting up review and approval of content\). The workflow tasks are managed on the My Tasks tab.

1.  On the Browse Spaces and Documents tab of the Alfresco panel, navigate to the document against which you want to start a workflow.

    You can also perform this action on the My Alfresco and Document Details tabs.

2.  Click ![Start Workflow](../images/MSAddin-workflow.png) \(**Start Workflow**\) for the document of interest.

    The My Tasks tab displays with the **Start Workflow** view.

3.  Select the **Workflow** type as **Review & Approve** or **Adhoc Task** from the list provided.

4.  Assign an Alfresco user to the workflow.

    Type the full or partial name and then select the desired user from the list of matches found.

5.  Optionally, click the empty field and select the due date for the task from the drop-down calendar.

6.  Type a description for the task.

7.  Click **Submit** to start the new workflow.

    The My Tasks tab displays the new workflow task for the user against whom you assigned the task.
