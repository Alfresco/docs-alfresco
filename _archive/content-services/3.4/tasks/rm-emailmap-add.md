# Adding an email map

The pre-defined email mappings cover the most commonly used email headers. You can include additional email header mappings using the Email Mappings tool.

This task assumes that you are in the Email Mappings page of the Records Management Console.

1.  Type the email header field in the **Map** box or select an email header from the menu.

2.  Select the Alfresco property name from the **to** menu.

    You can select an Alfresco property or a custom property.

3.  Click **Add**.

    The new mapping displays in the list of email mappings.

4.  Click **Save**.


If you do not wish to save your changes, click **Discard Changes**.
