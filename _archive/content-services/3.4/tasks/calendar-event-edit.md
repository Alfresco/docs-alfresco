# Editing an event

To edit a scheduled event, you must locate and then open the event. You can change any event details, including the location, date, and time. You can also add and remove tags associated with the event, and change the Document Library folder associated with the event.

This task assumes you are in the Calendar page component of the desired site.

1.  Locate and view the event you want to edit.

    The Event Information page displays the full details of the selected event.

2.  Click **Edit**.

    The Edit Eventpage appears.

3.  Make the desired changes to the event.

    The **What** field does not support the following special characters: \* < \> \\ / . ? : and \|.

4.  Edit the tags for this event as necessary.

    You can add and remove existing tags, or create new tags.

5.  Click **OK**.


The page closes and the calendar displays the updated event. No changes will be evident on the calendar unless you changed the event name.

-   **[Editing the event date and time](../tasks/calendar-event-edit-datetime.md)**  
In the Day and Week views, use convenient click-and-drag functionality to change the day, time, and duration of an event.
