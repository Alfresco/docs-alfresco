# Marking the current site as a favorite

Marking a site as a favorite enables you to easily access it from the **Sites** menu and on the My Sites dashlet. You can tag any number of sites this way.

This action is available only for sites not already marked as a favorite.

-   On the toolbar, expand the **Sites** menu and click **Add \[site name\] to Favorites**.

    The current site will now appear in the **My Favorites** list in the **Sites** menu. It will also appear marked as a favorite on the My Sites dashlet on your personal dashboard.
