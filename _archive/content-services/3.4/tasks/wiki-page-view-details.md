# Viewing the wiki page details

View the details for a wiki page to see the version history, view the tags associated with the page, and list the wiki pages that link to the selected page. You can view the page details from both the wiki list and the page view. On this page, you can view previous versions of the page and even revert to a specific version.

This task assumes you are in the Wiki page component of the desired site.

1.  In the wiki list, locate the wiki page whose details you want to view.

2.  Click **Details** for that page.

    If the wiki page you want to view is already open in the page view, simply click **Details** on that page.

    The page view displays the wiki page content in expanded form to include the Version History, Tags, and Linked Pages. From here, you can click **Edit Page**to make any necessary changes.

3.  Work with the **Version History** as desired:

    -   Select a previous version of the page from the **View version** menu in the top right corner of the content box.
    -   Expand a previous version in the **Earlier version\(s\)** list beneath the content box to view the version details.
    -   Click **Revert** for an earlier version to update the page using the content from the selected version.
4.  Click **View Page** to hide the details.

    The wiki page displays in the page view.
