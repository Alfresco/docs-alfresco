# Setting up the panel

If your panel has not already been configured to work with your instance of Alfresco, the configuration information displays automatically.

You can return to the configuration information at any time via the link at the bottom of the panel.

1.  Specify the URL to Alfresco Explorer.

    This is mandatory.

    For example, type http://server:8080/alfresco/

2.  Specify the URL for the CIFS server.

    Although this is optional, unless you are using Windows Vista, Alfresco recommends using the CIFS interface to access your documents. Confirm the correct address with your Alfresco administrator.

    For example, type \\\\servera\\alfresco\\\(v2.1 Enterprise and later\)

3.  Specify your user name and password for authentication unless you have single-source sign on \(NTLM\).

    These values are stored in the Windows registry and your password is encrypted against unauthorized use.

4.  Click **Save Settings**.


The configuration settings are confirmed for the Alfresco Explorer URL, WebDAV URL, and the CIFS server URL.
