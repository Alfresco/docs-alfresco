# Search for text

To search for a simple text string in any record content, enter the text string.

For example, to find the text “warship” in any record content:

1.  In the Query Text box, enter:

    `warship`

2.  In the Result Options area, select the checkbox for **Records**.

3.  To find a simple text string in any record name, title, description, or content:, in the Query Text box, enter:

    `keywords:warship`

    The keywords field is a special field name that allows you to match against the name, title, description, and content of a record.

    The syntax format of the keywords field, the colon \(:\), followed by the value to match against, is the basic syntax for matching against a field in search queries.
