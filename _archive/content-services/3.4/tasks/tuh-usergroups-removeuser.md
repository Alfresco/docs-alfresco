# Removing a user from a user group

A user that has been added to a user group can be removed.

Only an Administrator can remove a user from a user group.

1.  In the toolbar, click ![Administration Console](../images/im-adminconsole.png) **\(Administration Console\)**.

2.  Click **Manage User Groups**.

3.  On the Groups Management page, use the search feature to locate a specific user group or click **Show All** to display the existing root, or top-level, groups.

    **Note:** If not already displayed, click **Root Groups** beneath the space header to return to the top-level group.

4.  Navigate to the user group you want to remove users from.

    The page header displays the name of the selected group.

5.  On the Groups Management page, click ![Remove](../images/im-user-remove.png) **\(Remove\)** for the user you want to remove from the group.

    The user is removed without a prompt to confirm the action.

6.  Click **Close** to return to the Administration Console.
