# My Tasks

The My Tasks page component enables you to view and manage the tasks assigned to you. On the My Tasks page you can view a summary of your tasks, filter the task list, and access the actions for managing your tasks.

1.  On the toolbar, expand the **More** menu and click **My Tasks**.

    **Note:** Alternatively, click **All Tasks** on the My Tasks personal dashlet.

    The My Tasks page component appears, displaying a list of all tasks currently assigned to you. The summary provided for each task includes:

    -   task name
    -   due date
    -   current status of the task
    -   task type
    -   priority \(displayed as an icon that indicates the task is of high, medium, or low priority\)
    An icon \(![](../images/im-pooled.png)\) indicates a pooled task. Pooled tasks that can be claimed are marked as **Unassigned**.

    Where the list contains more tasks than can be displayed on a single page, the **Previous** and **Next** links at the top of the task list become enabled. Use these navigation buttons to move forward and backward through multiple pages of tasks.

2.  Use the filters provided to view a subset of the tasks.

    The browsing pane on the left side of the page enables you to display a specific set of tasks. The options are:

    -   **Tasks**

        Display all tasks

    -   **Due**

        Filter tasks by due date: **Today**, **Tomorrow**, **Next 7 Days**, **Overdue**, **No Date**

    -   **Priority**

        Filter tasks by priority: **High**, **Medium**, **Low**

    -   **Assignee**

        Filter tasks by assignee: view tasks assigned to you or view pooled tasks that are unassigned

3.  Manage your tasks.

    Positioning your cursor over a task displays the available actions:

    -   **Edit Task**: Allows you to edit the task
    -   **View Task**: Displays the task details
    -   **View Workflow**: Displays the workflow details
    **Note:** Click **Start Workflow** beneath the banner to initiate a new workflow.


-   **[Viewing tasks and workflows](../tasks/more-menu-mytasks-view.md)**  
From the My Tasks page, you can view the details for an individual task or for the workflow that initiated a task.
-   **[Editing a task](../tasks/more-menu-mytasks-edit.md)**  
A task assigned to you appears in your My Tasks personal dashlet and on the My Tasks page. Each task is your responsibility and remains assigned to you until you manage it. The actions available to be performed on an assigned task vary depending on the task type, such as Adhoc, Review, and Invitation.
