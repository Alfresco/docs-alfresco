# Deleting a replication job

If you no longer need a replication job, you can delete it from the Jobs list. If there is a chance you might need the job again, you may prefer to edit the job and simply disable it.

1.  On the toolbar, expand the **More** menu and click **Replication Jobs** in the Tools list.

2.  In the Jobs section, click the job you want to delete.

    The job appears highlighted in the list and its details appear on the right side of the page.

3.  Click **Delete**.

    A message prompts you to confirm the deletion of the selected job.

4.  Click **Delete**.

    The selected job is deleted from the jobs list.
