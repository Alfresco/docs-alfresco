# Viewing an item in a browser

While the preview feature enables you to view and navigate a content item directly in the application, you also have the option of viewing the item in your default browser.

This task assumes you are in the Document Library page component of the desired site.

1.  Navigate the library’s folder structure to locate the content item you want to view.

2.  In the item list, position the cursor over the item of interest to display the available actions.

3.  Click **View in Browser**.

    This action is also available on the details page.

    A new browser window opens displaying the selected content item. For some file types, such as Microsoft Office documents, the application will launch the item in its associated program.

    **Note:** When attempting to view a Microsoft Office document on a Windows machine, you may find that you are prompted for authentication details, even though you are already logged into Alfresco Share. To enable automatic authentication, you should follow the instructions in [http://support.microsoft.com/kb/943280](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/943280) to add the name of the Alfresco Share server to the AuthForwardServerList registry entry. If using Internet Explorer, you should also add the Alfresco Share server to the Local Intranet security zone.
