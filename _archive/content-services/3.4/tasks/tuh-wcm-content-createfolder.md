# Creating a folder

Within a web project, use folders to store and organize your web content. Create the folders within your personal sandbox as you need them.

1.  Navigate to the Sandbox view of the web project you want to work with.

2.  Click ![Browse Website](../images/im-browsewebsite.png) or **Browse Website** in your user sandbox \(**My Sandbox**\) to display the sandbox contents.

3.  In the **Browse Folders** pane, navigate the folder structure as necessary until the header displays the name of the folder in which you want to create a new folder.

4.  In the **Create** menu, click **Create Folder**.

5.  On the Create Folder page, type the relevant folder information.

6.  Click **OK**.

    The Browse Folders pane displays the newly created folder.
