# Customize the site content

Alfresco Share has the concept of page components which you can add to your site as customized functionality. A page component has rich functionality and is URL addressable.

1.  Ensure you are within your new site and click **Customize Site** in the **More** menu on the banner.

    On the **Customize Site** page, you can add and remove page components. The available page components are:

    -   **Wiki**

        The Wiki enables you to create web pages for a collaborative website. Anyone who accesses it can contribute or modify content using a simplified markup language.

    -   **Blog**

        The Blog page component enables you to add commentary, descriptions of events, and other material related to your site, such as graphics or video.

    -   **Document Library**

        The Document Library page component enables you to store and collaboratively manage any content related to a site, such as documents, media files, or graphics.

    -   **Calendar**

        The Calendar page component enables you to schedule and track events for all sites you own or of which you are a member.

    -   **Links**

        The Links page component enables you to maintain a list of web links related to the site.

    -   **Discussions**

        The Discussions page component is used to post user-generated content related to a site. These often take the form of questions or comments with threaded discussions.

    -   **Data Lists**

        The Data Lists page component allows you to create and manage lists relevant to the site.

    All the page components are displayed by default. For this scenario, there is no need to modify anything.

2.  Click **Cancel**.


You return to the site dashboard.
