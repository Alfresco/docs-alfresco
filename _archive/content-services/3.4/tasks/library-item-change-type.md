# Changing the content type

Each library item has a default content type. You can change the content type from its default to a more specific value.

This task assumes you are in the Document Library page component of the desired site.

Where properties are defined for the configured types, you are able to enhance the item by augmenting the type \(for example, changing a standard document to a policy document\) and then adding the appropriate metadata for that content type. The metadata then appears on both the details page and the Edit Metadata page for that content item.

1.  Locate and view the content item whose type you want to change.

2.  On the details page, click **Change Type**.

    The Change Type page appears.

3.  Select the desired type and click **OK**.

    **Note:** The **New Type** list remains empty until types are defined by an administrator.
