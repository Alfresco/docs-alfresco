# Creating a web form

A web form is a form created by a web developer for use in web projects. The web form is used by a Content Contributor to capture content and store it as XML content in the repository.

Web forms enable Content Contributors to create structured XML content based on an XML schema \(XSD\). When configured with one or more rendering engine templates, a web form can generate multiple renditions of the XML content \(for example, HTML and PDF\).

There are three main steps involved in creating a web form:

-   Specify general properties, including the XML schema to describe the XML content being collected and output path patterns that will be used when writing form content to the repository.
-   Select and configure one or more rendering engine templates to use for generating renditions of the XML content collected.
-   Select a default workflow to use when content generated by this form is submitted.

You can create a web form within the Web Forms space \(**Company Home** \> **Data Dictionary** \> **Web Forms**\), which is created automatically when you install WCM 2.1. You can also perform this task as part of creating a web project.

1.  Navigate to the Web Forms space \(**Company Home** \> **Data Dictionary** \> **Web Forms**\).

2.  In the **Create** menu, click **Create Web Form**.

    The Create Web Form Wizard opens.

3.  In Step One, Web Form Details, provide information about the web form you want to create, as follows.

    1.  To the right of the **Schema** box, click **Browse** to locate and upload the desired XML schema file. This file will have the extension XSD. Upon selecting the XML schema file, several fields are populated with default values.

    2.  Edit the **Root element**, **Name**, and **Title** values as desired.

    3.  Enter a **Description** for the web form, if desired.

    4.  Enter the **Output path pattern** to use when saving content generated from this web form.

        Click ![Help](../images/im-help.png) for guidelines on specifying this pattern. For more information, refer to [http://wiki.alfresco.com/wiki/WSF](http://wiki.alfresco.com/wiki/WSF).

4.  Click **Next**.

5.  In Step Two, Configure Templates, select and configure one or more rendering engine templates, if required, for the form being created.

    1.  To the right of the **Rendering Engine Template File** box, click **Browse** to locate and upload the desired template file. This file will have the extension XSL. Selecting the XML schema file populates some fields with default values.

    2.  Ensure the correct value is set for the **Rendering Engine**: for an FTL template file \(plain text output\), select **FreeMarker**; for an XSL template file \(HTML file output\), select **XSLT**; for an XSL-FO template file \(XML file output\), select XSL-FO.

    3.  Edit the **Title** as desired.

    4.  Enter a **Description** for the rendering engine template file.

    5.  In the **Rendition mimetype** list, select how the web form content is to be rendered.

    6.  Enter the **Output path pattern** to use when saving content generated from this web form.

        Click ![Help](../images/im-help.png) for guidelines on specifying this pattern.

    7.  Click **Add to List** to add the template.

    8.  Repeat this process to add and configure another template, if desired.

6.  Click **Next** when all templates are added.

7.  In Step Three, Configure Workflow, specify the default workflow for the web form being created, if desired.

    Configure workflow for a web form if you want the form to have the same workflow each time it is used in a web project. If you plan to use the web form in different projects that may require different workflows, you may want to configure the workflow when you create the web project, rather than specifying it for the web form itself.

    -   To select a default workflow, click **Yes** and select the desired workflow in the list provided.
    -   Click **No not now** to configure the workflow when creating a web project.
8.  Click **Next**.

9.  In Step Four, Summary, review the information and click **Finish** to create the web form as specified.

    The new web form appears as a space in the Web Forms space.
