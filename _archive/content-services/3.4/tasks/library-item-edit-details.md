# Editing folder or item details

Edit the basic details of a library folder or content item to rename it, edit its associated tags, and add or change the description. If the aspect *Classifiable* is configured for the selected folder or item, you also have the ability to edit the associated categories.

This task assumes you are in the Document Library page component of the desired site. To edit the details of a folder, the **Show Folders** feature must be enabled.

1.  Navigate the libraryâ€™s folder structure to locate the folder or item you want to work with.

2.  In the item list, position the cursor over the folder or item of interest to display the available actions.

3.  Click **Edit Metadata**.

    The Details for \[name\] page appears.

    **Note:** Click **Full Metadata Edit page** in the upper right corner to display the Edit Metadata page containing the metadata currently configured for the selected folder or item.

4.  Edit the folder or item details on this page as desired.

    The **Name** does not support the following special characters: \* < \> \\ / . ? : and \|. When the name contains a disallowed character, the **OK** button is disabled.

5.  Click **Select** beneath the **Tags** label to edit the tag associations. You can add and remove existing tags, and create new tags.

    On the Select page, the left column displays the existing tags for the current site. The right column displays the tags already associated with the folder or item.

    1.  To create a new tag, type the tag name in the empty box provided and click the **Create new item** icon. You can create only one tag at a time in this field. Multi-word tags are accepted and do not need to be entered within quotation marks. Creating a new tag automatically associates it with the current folder or item.

    2.  To add an existing tag, browse the left column and click the **Add** icon to the right of the tag\(s\) you wish to associate with the current folder or item.

    3.  To remove an existing tag, browse the right column and click the **Remove** icon to the right of the tag\(s\) you no longer want to be associated with the folder or item.

    4.  Click **OK** to save the changes.

6.  Click **Select** beneath the **Categories** label to edit the categories associated with the current folder or item. You can add and remove categories.

    On the Select page, the left column displays the available categories; click a category to display its subcategories.

    The button at the top of the list indicates your current location in the category hierarchy. Click this button to display the full path; click an entry to return to that point in the path. Click the up arrow to return to the previous level in the hierarchy.

    The right column displays the categories already associated with the folder or item.

    1.  To add a category, navigate the category hierarchy in the left column and click the **Add** icon to the right of the categories you wish to associate with the current folder or item.

    2.  To remove an existing category, click the **Remove** icon to the right of a category in the right column that you no longer want to be associated with the folder or item.

    3.  Click **OK** to save the changes.

7.  Click **OK** to save the edits.


The page closes and the content details are updated.
