# Selecting multiple list items

Select multiple list items in the current data list using the item check boxes in the leftmost column or the **Select** feature at the top of the list. You can select any number of items across multiple pages.

This task assumes you are in the Data Lists page component of the desired site and a list is displayed.

-   In the list displayed, select the desired list items in one of the following ways:

    -   Click a check box to select the associated list item.
    -   Click **Select** at the top of the data list and click **All**.
    Click **None** to clear the list selections. Click **Invert Selection** to toggle the check boxes to their opposite state.


The check boxes of the specified items appear selected in the data list.
