# Searching for dates

To search for date values, you can match date fields exactly. Dates must be encoded in the FTS Alfresco query syntax. The **Insert Date** control helps you to insert dates without needing to use the encoding syntax.

To return records that were filed on 10th September 2009:

1.  Select **Date Filed** from the **Insert Field** .

2.  Select the date using the **Insert Date** control. The query text displays as:

    `dateFiled:"2009-09-10"`
