# Creating a user group

Create a user group to organize Alfresco users.

Top level groups reside beneath the heading **Root Groups**. A group can contain sub-groups. Only an Administrator can create a user group.

1.  In the toolbar, click ![Administration Console](../images/im-adminconsole.png) **\(Administration Console\)**.

2.  Click **Manage User Groups**.

3.  On the Groups Management page, use the search feature to locate a specific user group or click **Show All** to display the existing root, or top-level, groups.

    **Note:** If not already displayed, click **Root Groups** beneath the space header to return to the top-level group.

4.  Navigate to the user group where you want to create a group.

5.  Click **Create Group**. To create a sub-group, click ![Create Sub-Group](../images/im-subgroup.png) **\(Create Sub-Group\)** associated with the group you wish to be the parent.

6.  On the Create Group page, enter the name of the group you are creating in the **Identifier** box.

    Once you provide an **Identifier** for the group, you cannot change it.

7.  Click **Create Group**.

    An additional viewing option in the space header allows you to view either all groups and sub-groups beneath the currently selected group or only the immediate child groups of the currently selected group. To the right of the icon ![Filter](../images/im-filter.png), select **All** or **Children**, as preferred. Once you set the filter option, click **Show All** to populate the Groups pane.

8.  Click **Close** to return to the Administration Console.
