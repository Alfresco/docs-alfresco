# Customizing a site dashboard

The site dashboard is an interactive user interface that contains information specific to the current site. Like your personal dashboard, site information is organized and displayed in dashlets, which represent the configured page components.

You should customize the site itself before customizing the site dashboard.

For each site, you can:

-   modify the dashboard appearance
-   select the site dashlets to appear on the dashboard
-   configure the display order of the selected dashlets

**To customize the site dashboard appearance and contents:**

1.  Enter the desired site.

2.  On the dashboard banner, click **Customize Dashboard**.

    The Customize Site Dashboard page appears. The image in the Current Layout section represents the currently selected layout. The Dashlets section displays the currently selected dashlets as they will appear on the site dashboard.

3.  Change the site dashboard layout:

    1.  Click **Change Layout** to display the available dashboard layouts.

    2.  Click the graphic of the desired layout or click **Select** to the right of it.

4.  Select the site dashlets:

    1.  Click **Add Dashlets** to display the available dashlets.

    2.  To add a dashlet, click the desired dashlet in the Add Dashlets section and drag it to the desired column.

    3.  To remove a dashlet, click the unwanted dashlet and drag it to the garbage can.

5.  Click and drag the dashlets within and across columns to configure the display order.

6.  Click **OK** to save your changes.


You return to the site dashboard, displaying the selected dashlets in the order configured.

If you customize the dashboard to display the Alfresco Global Feed dashlet, you can configure this dashlet to display any RSS feed. Similarly, if you customize the dashboard to display the Web View dashlet, you can configure it to display any website.
