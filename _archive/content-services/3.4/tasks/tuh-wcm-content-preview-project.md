# Previewing the web project

You can preview the web project from both a user sandbox and the Staging Sandbox.

In the Staging Sandbox, the preview displays the current version of the web project: the most recent staging snapshot.

In a user sandbox, the preview displays a virtualized view of the modified items from the userâ€™s sandbox integrated with the current snapshot. This allows the user to see how the website or web application would look and behave if the changes were submitted.

1.  Navigate to the Sandbox view of the web project you want to work with.

2.  Click **Preview Website** in the pane of the sandbox whose contents you wish to preview.

    A separate browser window or a new tab opens displaying the website or web application.
