# Editing web content

The Edit Web Content Wizard enables you to edit the content created by a web form within the same form that was used to create the content. When you save the edits, the web form renditions, if applicable, are automatically regenerated and saved.

1.  Navigate to the Sandbox view of the web project you want to work with.

2.  Use one of the following methods to locate the content item you want to edit:

    -   In your user sandbox \(**My Sandbox**\), click ![Expand](../images/im-expand.png) to expand the **Modified Items** list.
    -   In your user sandbox \(**My Sandbox**\), click ![Expand](../images/im-expand.png) to expand the **Web Forms** list. Click **Browse Content** to display a list of all content items within the web project that were generated from the associated web form.
    -   Click ![Browse Website](../images/im-browsewebsite.png) **\(Browse Website\)** for your personal sandbox in the **User Sandboxes** pane. In the sandbox, navigate the folder structure to locate the content item.
3.  Click ![Edit](../images/im-edit.png) **\(Edit\)** for the content item of interest.

    The Edit Web Content Wizard opens.

4.  In Step One, Author Web Content, make changes to the content as required.

5.  Click **Next**.

6.  In Step Two, Summary, review the content. If all work on this content is complete, select the **Submit** option to immediately submit the updated content.

    When workflow is defined, selecting this option submits the content for review. In this case, the content is available only for preview until approved or rejected. If workflow is defined for both the form and the project, the form workflow is followed. When no workflow is defined, the content is promoted to the Staging Sandbox.

    If you choose not to submit the content as part of the edit process, you can initiate the submit process separately. See [Submitting content items](tuh-wcm-content-submit.md).

    To view the updated content before finalizing the task, click ![Preview](../images/im-preview.png).

7.  Click **Finish**.

    The content item and its renditions, if applicable, are updated and displayed in the **Modified Items** list.
