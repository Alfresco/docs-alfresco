# Editing a list item

Edit an existing list item to modify it. Only a Site Manager, a Site Collaborator, and the user who created the item can edit it.

This task assumes you are in the Data Lists page component of the desired site and a list is displayed.

1.  In the current data list, position your cursor over the list item you want to edit to display the available actions.

2.  Click **Edit**.

    The Edit Data Item page appears displaying the details for the selected item.

3.  Make the desired changes to the item details.

4.  Click **Submit**.

    The updated item appears in the list.
