# Editing the list details

Edit an existing list to modify its title and description. Only a Site Manager, a Site Collaborator, and the user who created the list can edit it.

This task assumes you are in the Data Lists page component of the desired site.

1.  In the browsing pane, position your cursor over the list you want to edit to display the available actions.

2.  Click **Edit list details** to the right of the list name.

    The Edit List Details page appears displaying the current list details.

3.  Make the desired changes to the list details.

4.  Click **Submit**.
