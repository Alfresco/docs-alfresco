# Browsing the File Plan

There are several ways that you can navigate the File Plan and browse the items within each level.

1.  Navigate to the left panel.

    You can view the record series, record categories, and record folders using the tree hierarchy in the left navigation panel. To view the item, click the name link in the item list.

2.  Each level in the File Plan structure provides appropriate actions for the record series, record category, record folder, and records.

    These actions allow you to manage the metadata, move, copy, and delete.

3.  Navigate using the breadcrumb in the **Location** banner.
