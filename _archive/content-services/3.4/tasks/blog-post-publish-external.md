# Publishing a post to an external blog

In addition to publishing a blog post to the site's internal blog, you can publish a post to a configured external blog. To publish a draft post externally, you must also publish it internally.

This task assumes you are in the Blog page component of the desired site and an external blog is configured.

1.  In the post list, locate the blog post you want to publish externally.

2.  Click **Publish Externally**.

    Optionally, open the post to perform this action.


A message indicates the selected blog post is published.

**Parent topic:**[The blog](../concepts/blog-intro.md)
