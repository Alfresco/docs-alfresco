# Browsing the wiki pages

The browsing pane to the left of the wiki page list enables you to filter the wiki content to make locating specific wiki pages more manageable.

This task assumes you are in the Wiki page component of the desired site.

The wiki page list displays all wiki pages in the current site, organized chronologically. The most recent page appears at the top of the list.

The browsing pane on the left site of the page enables you to display a subset of the wiki content by selecting a specific view or a tag. Whether browsing by view or tag, the wiki list displays a summary of all pages matching the selected option. The summary includes the wiki page name, author, creation and modification dates, a sample of the content, and the tags associated with the page.

The browsing pane provides the following views:

-   **Recently Modified**

    Displays the pages modified in the past seven days

-   **All**

    Displays all pages created in the wiki for the current site

-   **Recently Added**

    Displays the pages created in the past seven days

-   **My Pages**

    Displays the pages created by the currently logged in user


The **Tags** list displays all tags currently associated with one or more wiki pages.

**To browse the wiki pages:**

1.  Click **Wiki Page List** on the page view to navigate to the wiki list, if it is not already displayed.

2.  Select the desired option in the browsing pane:

    -   In the **Pages** list, click the view representing the wiki pages you want to display. The wiki list displays all pages in the current site that correspond to the selection.
    -   In the **Tags** list, click the tag of interest. The wiki list displays all pages in the current site associated with the selected tag.
3.  In the wiki list, click a wiki page title to display that full page.


The selected wiki page appears in the page view.
