# Deleting a rule

If you no longer need a rule, you can delete it from the rule set. If there is a chance you might need the rule again, you may prefer to edit the rule and simply disable it.

**Note:** Although you can view the details for an inherited rule on this page, the **Delete** action is not available. You can delete a rule only in the folder where it was created.

This task assumes you are on the Rules page in the Document Library page component and that the selected folder has a defined rule set.

1.  In the rules list on the left side of the page, select the rule you want to delete.

    The rule appears highlighted in the list and its details appear to the right.

2.  Click **Delete**.

    A message prompts you to confirm the deletion of the selected rule.

3.  Click **Delete**.


The selected rule is deleted from the rule set. You return to the Rules page.
