# Searching for and viewing a user account

The User Search feature enables you to locate any Share user and view that userâ€™s account information.

1.  On the toolbar, expand the **More** menu and click **Users** in the Tools list.

    The User Search page appears.

2.  In the search box, type the full or partial name of the desired user.

    You must enter a minimum of one \(1\) character. The search is not case sensitive.

3.  Click **Search**.

    In the results table, click the column headings to sort the results as desired.

    In the first column, a green dot indicates the user account is currently enabled; a red dot indicates the account is disabled.

4.  Click the name of the desired user to display the related user profile and account details.


The User Profile page displays. From here you can edit or delete the user account.
