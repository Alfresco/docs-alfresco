# Changing the role of a site member or site group

A Site Manager can, at any time, change the role assigned to a site member or site group.

This task assumes you are in the Members page component of the desired site.

1.  Beneath the banner, select **People** or **Groups** to display the appropriate search page.

    This displays either the Search for Site Members or Search for Site Groups page.

2.  Locate the site member or group whose role you want to change for the current site.

    The page displays the search results. A button to the right of the member/group name indicates the assigned role for this site.

3.  Click the button displaying the currently assigned role.

    A list displays the available roles: **Manager**, **Collaborator**, **Contributor**, and **Consumer**.

4.  Click the appropriate role for the site member.


Share assigns the selected role.
