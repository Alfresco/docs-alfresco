# Editing the site details

Once you create a site, you can edit the name and description from anywhere in the site. You can also change the access \(public or private\) for the site. Only the Site Manager can edit the site details.

1.  Enter the desired site.

2.  On the dashboard banner, click **More** and then **Edit Site Details**.

    The Edit Site Details page displays the current details for this site.

3.  Make the desired changes to the site **Name** and **Description**.

4.  Change the site visibility, if desired.

5.  Click **OK**.


The Edit Site Details page closes and the site dashboard displays the updated details on the banner and the Site Profile dashlet.
