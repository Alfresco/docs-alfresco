# Deleting a user group

Delete a group to permanently remove it from the system.

Deleting a group also deletes all sub-groups and users associated with it. Only an Administrator can delete a user group.

1.  In the toolbar, click ![Administration Console](../images/im-adminconsole.png) **\(Administration Console\)**.

2.  Click **Manage User Groups**.

3.  On the Groups Management page, use the search feature to locate a specific user group or click **Show All** to display the existing root, or top-level, groups.

    **Note:** If not already displayed, click **Root Groups** beneath the space header to return to the top-level group.

4.  Navigate to the user group you want to delete.

    The page header displays the name of the selected group.

5.  In the **More Actions** menu, click **Delete Group**.

    A message prompts you to confirm the deletion of the selected user group.

6.  Click **Delete**.

7.  Click **Close** to return to the Administration Console.
