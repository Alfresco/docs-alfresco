# Editing a web form

You can edit an existing web form to update the general properties; select and configure the associated rendering engine templates; and specify workflow for content generated by the web form.

Note that editing a web form in the Web Forms space within the Data Dictionary will affect existing web projects currently using that form. When you edit a web form, a message at the top of Step One indicates the web projects currently using the form.

Use the **Next** and **Back** buttons to walk through the steps in the **Edit Web Form Wizard**.

1.  Navigate to the Web Forms space. This can be found at: **Company Home** \> **Data Dictionary** \> **Web Forms**.

2.  In the **Browse Spaces** pane, click ![Edit Web Form](../images/im-edit.png) **\(Edit Web Form\)** for the web form you want to edit.

    The Edit Web Form Wizard opens.

3.  In Step One, Web Form Details, edit the general properties.

    1.  To remove the current schema, click ![Remove](../images/im-delete.png) **\(Remove\)** to the right of the schema.

4.  In Step Two, Configure Templates, select and configure, or remove, rendering engine templates.

    1.  To select and configure a template, refer to the topic [Creating a web form](tuh-wcm-webform-create.md).

    2.  To remove a template, click ![Remove](../images/im-delete.png) **\(Remove\)** to the right of the template in the **Selected Rendering Engines** list that you wish to remove for this web form.

5.  In Step Three, Configure Workflow, specify or clear default workflow for the web form.

    When you configure the workflow as part of the web form, the form will have the same workflow each time it is used in a web project. If you plan to use the web form in different projects that may require different workflows, you would want to configure the workflow when you create the web project, rather than specifying it for the web form itself.

    1.  To select a default workflow, click **Yes** and select the desired workflow in the list provided.

    2.  To change the currently selected workflow, select the desired workflow in the list provided.

    3.  To clear workflow specified for this web form, click **No not now**.

6.  In Step Four, Summary, review the information and click **Finish** to save the updated web form.
