# Exporting the audit log

Export allows you to archive the audit log periodically and enables, for example, external auditors to examine or analyze system activity. When you export the audit log, this does not affect the audit log in the system.

1.  In the Records Management dashlet, click **Management Console**.

2.  In the tools list, select **Audit**.

3.  Click **Export**.

    The export log displays relevant node name and link.
