# Copying content

You can copy an entire folder or an individual item to another site within Share or to any space in the Alfresco Explorer repository. The selected content remains in its original location and a copy is placed in the destination folder \(Share\) or space \(Explorer\) specified.

This task assumes you are in the Document Library page component of the desired site. To copy a folder and its contents, you must enable the **Show Folders** feature.

This feature is also available for multiple selections being copied to a common destination.

1.  Navigate the libraryâ€™s folder structure to locate the content you want to copy.

2.  In the item list, position the cursor over the folder or item of interest to display the available actions.

3.  Click **More** and then **Copy to**.

    The Copy \[name\] to page appears.

4.  Select the Destination:

    -   Click **Sites** to copy the selected content to another site in Share.
    -   Click **Repository** to copy the selected content to a space in Explorer.
    -   Click **My User Home** to copy the selected content to your User Home space in Explorer
5.  Specify the path, as follows, depending on whether you are copying to a Share site or an Explorer repository:

    -   When copying to a site, click the desired site in the **Site** list. For the **Path**, navigate the folder structure and click the destination folder.
    -   When copying to a repository or your User Home space, navigate the repository structure and click the destination space.
6.  Click **Copy**.


The page closes and a copy of the content is placed in the specified location.
