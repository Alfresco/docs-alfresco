# Deleting a web form

Delete a web form from the Data Dictionary when you no longer want the form to be associated with any web projects.

Deleting a web form in the Web Forms space also removes this web form from all existing web projects with which the form is associated. Although content created from the web form is not affected, users will no longer be able to create new content or edit existing content created using the form.

1.  Navigate to the Web Forms space \(**Company Home** \> **Data Dictionary** \> **Web Forms**\).

2.  Click ![Delete](../images/im-delete.png) **\(Delete\)** for the web form you want to delete from this space.

3.  On the Delete Space page, select the first option: **This space and all its contents**.

4.  Click **OK**.

    Alfresco processes the deletion and returns you to the Web Forms space.
