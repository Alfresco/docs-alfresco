# Creating a search

This task assumes you are in the Search page.

1.  Enter the search query using the search query syntax in the **Query Text** box.

    You can select the required field name from the **Insert Field** drop down list. When you select a field name, the internal name for the field is inserted into the query, followed by the colon character. Add the search value after the colon, ensuring that there is no space between the colon and the value.

2.  Select the type of data that you want to return in the Results page.

    1.  In the **Metadata** area, select the metadata fields that you wish to display in the search results. The metadata name becomes a column title in the results table, which can then be sorted.

    2.  In the **Order** area, select the ordering of the search results.

    3.  In the **Components** area, select the type of components to search. You can search for categories, series, and folders, or search on the Vital Record Review Period.

3.  Click **Search**.

    The search results display in a table in the Results tab.


To create a new search, click **New Search**. The Criteria tab clears for you to enter a new search query.
