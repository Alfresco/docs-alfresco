# Searching for special types

To search for special types, you can match the special type names using ASPECT.

For example, to search for all digital photograph records:

1.  In the Query Text box, type:

    `ASPECT:"dod:digitalPhotographRecord"`

2.  In the Results options area, select the checkbox for **Records**.


You can also search on the following special fields:

|Special fields|Description|
|--------------|-----------|
|dod:scannedRecord|Search for all scanned records.|
|dod:pdfRecord|Search for all PDF records.|
|dod:webRecord|Search for all web page records.|
