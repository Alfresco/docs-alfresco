# Browsing the calendar

The main view of the Calendar page component defaults to a calendar displaying the current month. The browsing pane to the left provides another calendar for navigating the months without affecting the main view.

This task assumes you are in the Calendar page component of the desired site.

1.  Use the navigation buttons in the header to change the main calendar view:

    1.  Use the **Day**, **Week**, and **Month** buttons to change the main display to a daily, weekly, or monthly view.

    2.  Use the **Previous** and **Next** buttons to move forward and backward through the calendar, either a day, week, or month at a time, depending on the current view.

    3.  Click **Agenda** to view a list of the upcoming events scheduled for this site.

    4.  Click **Today** to display the current date.

2.  Use the calendar in the browsing pane to navigate through the months without affecting the main view.

    1.  Click **<** to display the previous month.

    2.  Click **\>** to display the next month.

    3.  Click **This Month** beneath the browsing pane calendar to reset this calendar to the current month. A black box outlines the current day. Dates with scheduled events appear highlighted.

3.  Click a date on the browsing pane calendar to load the selected date on the calendar in the main view.

    If the Agenda is currently displayed, no update occurs in the main view.

4.  In the **Tags** list, click the tag of interest to display only the associated events in the main view.

    Click **All Tags** to display all events.

5.  Click **iCal Feed** in the header to take advantage of calendar data exchange.
