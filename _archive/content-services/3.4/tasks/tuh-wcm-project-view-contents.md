# Viewing the sandbox contents

Within a sandbox, the web project files are organized in folders. The sandbox displays all website or web application content.

The actions available within your personal sandbox depend upon your assigned role.

At any time, click the web project name in the breadcrumb path to return to the Sandbox view.

1.  Navigate to the Sandbox view of the web project you want to work with.

2.  Click **Browse Website** in the pane of the sandbox whose contents you want to view. Alternately, click ![Staging Sandbox](../images/im-stagingsandbox.png) in the Staging Sandbox to view the contents of that sandbox; click ![Browse Website](../images/im-browsewebsite.png) in a user sandbox to view the contents of that sandbox.

    As you navigate the folder structure in the **Browse Folders** pane, a navigation path is displayed beneath the space header indicating your current location. Click any folder in the path to step back to that view.
