# Uploading content from your computer

The basic process for uploading a file from your computer into a web project is the same as when uploading content to a standard Alfresco space.

1.  Navigate to the Sandbox view of the web project you want to work with.

2.  Click ![Browse Website](../images/im-browsewebsite.png) or **Browse Website** in your user sandbox \(**My Sandbox**\) to display the contents of the sandbox.

3.  Within your sandbox, navigate to the folder to which you want to upload the file.

4.  In the **Create** menu, click **Add Content**.

5.  On the Add Content page, click **Browse**.

6.  Locate the file on your computer that you want to upload and click **Open**.

    A message informs you that your upload was successful.

7.  Verify the **General Properties** information and click **OK**.

    The uploaded content appears in the **Browse Files** pane.

8.  Return to the Sandbox view and click ![Expand](../images/im-expand.png) to expand the **Modified Items** list in **My Sandbox**.

    The newly added content is displayed.
