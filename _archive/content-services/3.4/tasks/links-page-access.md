# Accessing the Links page component

Accessing the Links page component enables you to view the links created for the current site. You can create new links, as well as edit and delete the links that you created. You can add a comment to any link listed.

1.  Enter the desired site.

2.  On the banner, click **Links**.

    The Links page component appears, displaying a list of all existing links \(the **All Links** view\). The summary includes:

    -   the link title
    -   the link URL; an icon to the right of the URL indicates the link will open in a new window
    -   the date and time the link was created
    -   the author who created the link
    -   a description of the link
    -   the tags associated with the link
3.  Use the **Previous** and **Next** navigation buttons to move forward and backward through multiple pages of links.

4.  Click **Simple View** to display only the title and URL of each link in the list.

    Click **Detailed View** to display the summary view.
