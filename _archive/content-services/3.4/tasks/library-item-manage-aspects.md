# Managing aspects

The **Manage Aspects** feature lets you add aspects to a content item. Alfresco Share provides you with a list of default aspects.

An aspect can be used to add metadata to the content item. For a detailed list of aspects available in Alfresco Share and their description, see [About aspects](../concepts/aspect-about.md).

This task assumes that you are in the document library of the desired site.

Aspects allow addition of functionality to a content item. To add an aspect to a content item, complete the following steps:

1.  Navigate the library’s folder structure to locate the content item or folder you want to work with.

2.  Open the content item and click **Manage Aspects** under **Document Actions**.

    The Aspects for \[name\] page appears.

3.  In the **Available to Add** list select the aspects you wish to add for this item.

    Remove any existing aspects from the **Currently Selected** list as desired.

4.  Click **Apply changes**.

    The selected aspects have now been applied to your content item. This adds additional properties to your content item, which are displayed in the Document Details page. You can edit these properties using **Edit Properties** under **Document Actions**.
