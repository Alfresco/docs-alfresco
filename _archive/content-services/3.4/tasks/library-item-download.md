# Downloading content to your computer

You can download an item from the **Library** tree or from one of the browsing views \(**All Documents**, **I’m Editing**, **Others are Editing**, **Recently Modified**, **Recently Added**, **My Favorites**\) to your computer.

This task assumes you are in the Document Library page component of the desired site.

When you select a locked item, you are downloading the last version checked into the document library. It is important to realize that this version may be out of date. As the item is being edited by another site member, a more recent version may exist outside the library.

1.  Navigate the library’s folder structure to locate the item you want to download.

2.  In the item list, position the cursor over the item of interest to display the available actions.

3.  Click **Download**.

    You are prompted to open or save the file.

4.  Choose to save the file to your computer.

    Depending on your browser, you are prompted to specify a destination or the item is downloaded to a default location.

5.  Once the download is complete, close the dialog box.


A copy of the selected file now exists on your computer.
