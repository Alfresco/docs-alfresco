# Reordering the rules in the rule set

As part of managing your rule set, you can specify the order in which the rules are run. Rules marked as inactive will simply be skipped. If the selected folder includes inherited rules, those will be run first in the order displayed.

**Note:** You cannot reorder inherited rules; that must be done in the folder where the rules were created.

This task assumes you are on the Rules page in the Document Library page component and that the selected folder has a defined rule set.

1.  In the rules list on the left side of the page, select the rule you want to reposition.

    The rule appears highlighted in the list and its details appear to the right.

2.  Click and drag the rule into the desired position in the list. Repeat this process to reposition additional rules.

    **Note:** Click **Reset** to return the rule set to its last saved order.

3.  Click **Save**.


The rule set is saved as it appears.
