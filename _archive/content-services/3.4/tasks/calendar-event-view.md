# Viewing an event

The calendar displays only the name provided for a scheduled event, so to view full details you must open the event. Once open, you can edit or delete the event.

This task assumes you are in the Calendar page component of the desired site.

1.  Locate the event of interest in one of the following ways:

    -   Navigate the calendar on the main view.
    -   Navigate the calendar in the browsing pane and select a date to update the main view calendar.
    -   Click **Agenda** to display all future events currently scheduled.
2.  In the main view, click the event of interest.

    The Event Information page displays the full details of the selected event. The Documents section indicates the folder in the Document Library where material related to the event is located. Click the link provided to navigate to the specified location.

3.  Click **Cancel**.
