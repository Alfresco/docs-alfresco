# Configuring for Internationalization

Internationalization \(often abbreviated I18N\) means that your dashlet is mindful of the current user’s language and locale settings so that, for example, the dashlet renders in Spanish for Spanish speakers and in French for French speakers. It is good practice to design your site’s page components to enable them to work for multiple locales. Custom dashlets can use message bundles to enable Internationalization.

The Knowledge Base article you defined in your content model is already I18N-enabled. The repository web script \(`kb-search`\) returns a pure data version of this article and can handle any locale-specific selection. However, the content and markup generated by the dashlet itself comprises HTML markup and human readable text. HTML markup generally works the same across different countries and different browsers, unlike human readable text. The solution is to use a message bundle to store keys or identifiers that your dashlet will look up to determine the human-readable text to use when generating a response for a given locale. The web script runtime automatically locates the bundle and makes it available to your dashlet.

1.  Create a message bundle file called knowledgebase.get.properties, and define any key/value pairs.

    For example:

    ```
    header.knowledgebase=Knowledge Base
    label.all=Total number of articles
    label.drafts=Drafts
    label.pendingApprovals=Pending for approval
    label.current=Current
    label.archived=Archived
    error.call=An error occurred when getting the knowledge base summary
    ```

    This is the default bundle that will be used if the locale cannot be determined or if there is no matching bundle for the current locale.

2.  To provide additional message bundles for different locales, for example, to support Dutch in the Netherlands, add the extension “nl-NL” to the file.

    **Note:**

    You can access these values in your web script using code like this: `${msg("header.knowledgebase")}`, which pulls the value of `header.knowledgebase` from the bundle appropriate to the current locale. It is good practice to design your web script to use a configuration file so you can modify runtime information without changing the source code. Web script configuration files sit alongside scriptable controllers and view templates. Their contents are available to your web script when it executes. A web script configuration file comprises XML from which the web script can draw properties and values. By convention, it would be called knowledgebase.get.config.xmland look like this:

    ```
    <knowledgebase>
       <serviceFormat>json</serviceFormat>
       <!--<serviceFormat>cmis</serviceFormat>-->
    </knowledgebase>
    ```

    This configuration file provides information to the web script’s scriptable controller about how to access the Alfresco repository service. It can talk to the Alfresco repository using either JSON or CMIS. If configured to use JSON, the web script calls over to the custom `kb-search` web script. If configured to use CMIS, the web script calls over using the CMIS open standard APIs.

    By default, things are set up to use your custom web script \(the JSON option\). However, if you are on a CMIS 1.0 compatible version of Alfresco, you can use the CMIS APIs, which will not require the `kb-search` repository web script.
