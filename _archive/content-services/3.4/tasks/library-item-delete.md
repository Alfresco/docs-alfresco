# Deleting content

Delete content to permanently remove it from a site’s library. Deleting a folder removes both the folder and its contents from the library.

This task assumes you are in the Document Library page component of the desired site and that the **Show Folders** feature is enabled.

This feature is also available for multiple selections.

1.  Navigate the library’s folder structure to locate the content item or folder you want to work with.

2.  In the item list, position the cursor over the content of interest to display the available actions.

3.  Click **More** and then **Delete Document** or **Delete Folder**.

    A message prompts you to confirm the deletion.

4.  Click **Delete**.
