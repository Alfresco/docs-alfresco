# Configuring the Standalone Transformation Server

This section describes how to configure the Standalone Transformation Server. You need only to change the password of the transformation service.

1.  Open your browser and navigate to the following URL:

    http://<tranformation-host\>:<port\>/transformation-server/settings

    \(or https:// when using SSL\)

2.  Enter your login name and a password.

    By default, the login name is set to `alfresco`, and the password is set to `alfresco`. The login name `alfresco` cannot be changed.

3.  Enter a new password, and then click **Change** to save the password.


If you close and reopen your browser, reenter your login and new password.
