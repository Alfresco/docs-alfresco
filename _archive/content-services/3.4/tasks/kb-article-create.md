# Creating and contributing an article

You can create a Knowledge Base article and contribute it to your Knowledge Base using either Alfresco Explorer or CIFS desktop integration.

1.  In Alfresco Explorer, click the new Knowledge Base space.

2.  Click the Create menu and select Create Content from the list.

    This opens the Create Content Wizard, which you will use to create a Knowledge Base article.

3.  In Step One - Specify name and select type:

    1.  In the Name field, type a name for your Knowledge Base article, such asArticle1.txt.

        This example uses the extension “.txt” so that the article is treated as plain text.

    2.  In the Type menu, select Content.

    3.  In the Content Type menu, select Plain Text.

    4.  In the Other Properties area, clear the check box.

    5.  Click **Next**.

4.  In Step Two - Enter Content, type the following:

    A book is a gift you can open again and again

5.  Click Finish to create your content.

6.  To use CIFS to contribute documents directly using the file system:

    1.  \(Windows\) Map a drive to your Alfresco instance.

    2.  From a command prompt, run the following:

        `net use z: \\<MACHINE_NAME>A`

    3.  Log in to the drive using administrator credentials \(admin/admin\).

        You now have a drive \(Z:\) mapped to your desktop that you can browse just as you would a normal drive or folder, and drag and drop content into this drive. You can use your desktop applications to create documents and save them directly into Alfresco.
