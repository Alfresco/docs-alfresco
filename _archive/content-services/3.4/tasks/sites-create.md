# Creating a site

You can create a site from anywhere in the application using the **Sites** menu on the toolbar. When creating a site, you have the option of making it public or private. The user who creates the site becomes the Site Manager.

A public site is available to be viewed by all users, whether or not they have joined the site. Users who join a site are listed as site members and can work with the site content, depending on their assigned roles. A private site is available only to the Site Manager and users invited to join the site by a Site Manager. A site can have multiple Managers.

1.  On the toolbar, expand the **Sites** menu and click **Create Site**.

    Alternately, on your personal dashboard, click **Create Site** on the My Sites dashlet.

    The Create Site page appears. Fields marked with an asterisk \(\*\) are required.

2.  Complete the basic site information: **Name**, **URL Name**, and **Description**.

    The site name is a descriptive name that will display as the title of your site. This is mandatory.

    The URL name is a short version of the name to be used as the URL. This URL name does not support the following special characters: \* < \> \\ / . ? : and \|. When the entry contains a disallowed character, the **OK** button is disabled.

    The description should provide enough information for users to be able to distinguish your site from others on the My Sites dashlet.

3.  Specify the site visibility as **Public** or **Private**. To configure this as a moderated public site, where the Site Manager can control membership in the site, select **Moderated site membership**.

4.  Click **OK**.


The Create Site page closes and the application displays the Site Dashboard of the newly created site. The site appears in the My Sites dashlet on your personal dashboard. Sites created by you are automatically added to your **My Favorites** list.
