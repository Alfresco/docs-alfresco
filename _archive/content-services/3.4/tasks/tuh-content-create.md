Create text files, HTML files, and XML files directly in a space.

Other types of files must be uploaded from your hard drive.

    The space header displays the name and details of the space where the content will reside.

2.  In the **Create** menu, click **Create Content**.

    The Create Content Wizard appears displaying the Details page.

3.  In Step One, Specify name and select type, enter a name for the file in the **Name** box. Leave the **Type** as **Content**.

    When creating HTML content, use the formatting features available to you. To view the content with the HTML markup, click ![Edit HTML Source](../images/im-html.png) **\(Edit HTML Source\)**. This opens the HTML Source Editor where you can edit the text and tags. Click **Update** to close the window and return to the Enter Content pane with the contents updated.

8.  Click **Next**.

9.  In Step Three, Summary, review the file details.

10. Click **Finish**.
