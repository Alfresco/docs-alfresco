# Creating a new link

Create a new link to associate with the current site. You can add any internal or external web address that you feel may be useful or relevant for users of the site.

This task assumes you are in the Links page component of the desired site.

1.  Click **New Link**.

    The Create Link page appears.

2.  Type a **Title** and **Description** for the link.

3.  In the **URL** box, type the web address of the link you are creating.

    By default, new links are external. If the link being created is internal, select the **Internal** check box. Links marked as **Internal** open in the same browser window.

4.  Optionally, add existing or create new tags for the link:

    The newly associated tags appear. Click a tag to remove it.

5.  Click **Save**.

    The new link appears with the **Add Comment** box displayed beneath it.

6.  Click **Links List** to return to the main view.
