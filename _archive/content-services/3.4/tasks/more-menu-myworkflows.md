# Workflows I've Started

The Workflows I’ve Started page component enables you to view and manage the workflows you have initiated. On the Workflows I’ve Started page you can view a summary of your workflows, filter the workflow list, and cancel a workflow.

1.  On the toolbar, expand the **More** menu and click **Workflows I’ve Started**.

    The Workflows I’ve Started page component appears, displaying a list of all workflows you created. The summary provided for each workflow includes:

    -   workflow name
    -   due date
    -   date started
    -   workflow type
    -   priority \(displayed as an icon that indicates the task is of high, medium, or low priority\)
    Where the list contains more workflows than can be displayed on a single page, the **Previous** and **Next** links at the top of the workflow list become enabled. Use these navigation buttons to move forward and backward through multiple pages of workflows.

2.  Use the filters provided to view a subset of the workflows.

    The browsing pane on the left side of the page enables you to display a specific set of workflows. The options are:

    -   **Workflows**

        Display all workflows

    -   **Due**

        Filter workflows by due date: **Today**, **Tomorrow**, **Next 7 Days**, **Overdue**, **No Date**

    -   **Started**

        Started Filter workflows by start date: **Last 7 days**, **Last 14 days**, **Last 28 days**

    -   **Priority**

        Filter workflows by priority: **High**, **Medium**, **Low**

    -   **Workflow Type**

        Filter workflows by type: **Adhoc**, **Group Review & Approve**, **Parallel Review & Approve**, **Pooled Review & Approve**, **Review & Approve**, **Review & Publish**, **Review & Publish Section Structure**

3.  Manage your workflows.

    Positioning your cursor over a task displays the available actions:

    -   **View Workflow**: Displays the workflow details
    -   **Cancel Workflow**: Cancels the selected workflow
    **Note:** Click **Start Workflow** beneath the banner to initiate a new workflow.


-   **[Viewing a workflow](../tasks/more-menu-myworkflows-view.md)**  
From the Workflows I’ve Started page, you can view the full details of a workflow, including a workflow summary, details on the most recently completed task, and a summary of all tasks generated by the workflow.
-   **[Cancelling a workflow](../tasks/more-menu-myworkflows-cancel.md)**  
When a workflow is no longer required, you can cancel it. This removes the workflow from your Workflows I’ve Started page. It also deletes all tasks related to the workflow, removing them from the assignees’ My Tasks dashlets.
