# Creating content in the library

The **Create Content** feature enables you to create text files, HTML files, and XML files directly in a site’s document library.

This task assumes you are in the Document Library page component of the desired site.

Before creating your content, you must first decide where in the library you want it to reside. The **Library** section of the browsing pane in the Document Library page component displays the available folders. Create a new folder if necessary.

1.  Navigate the library’s folder structure and click the folder where the item being uploaded will reside.

2.  Click **Create Content** and then select the type of content you wish to create: **Plain Text**, **HTML**, or **XML**.

    The Create Content page appears.

3.  Type a **Name** for the page.

    The **Name** does not support the following special characters: \* < \> \\ / . ? : and \|. When the name contains a disallowed character, the **Create** button is disabled.

4.  Provide a title and description, if desired.

    The title and description enable you to provide additional information as to the content and purpose of the item.

5.  Type the desired content in the **Content** box.

    If you are creating a plain text document, simply enter the desired text.

    For an HTML document, use the features provided to format the text, insert or edit links, anchors, and images, and to insert and customize tables. To assist with editing, use the undo, redo, and remove formatting features as needed. Position the cursor over an icon to display its function. Click and drag the bottom right corner to resize the text editor.

    **Note:** When you save an HTML document, some text formatting may not save due to security reasons.

    For an XML document, enter your content with the appropriate XML tagging.

6.  Click **Create**.


The page closes and the item list for the specified folder displays the newly created content item.
