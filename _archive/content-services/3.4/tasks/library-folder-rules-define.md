# Defining rules for a folder

To automate and manage your Document Library content, define rules at the folder level. You can do this by creating rules for the selected folder or by linking the folder to an existing rule set from another folder.

This task assumes you are in the Document Library page component of the desired site, the **Show Folders** feature is enabled, and you are working with a folder with no existing rules.

When a rule is created for a folder, it applies to all content items that are added to the folder after the creation of the rule. Items residing in the folder before the rule was created are not affected by the rule. The **Run Rules** feature enables you to manually apply a rule set to the contents of a folder.

1.  Navigate the library’s folder structure to locate the folder you want to work with.

    The symbol ![](../images/im-rules-icon.png) to the left of a folder indicates that rules are already defined for it. To work with existing rules, see [Managing Rules](library-folder-rules-manage.md).

2.  In the item list, position the cursor over the folder of interest to display the available actions.

3.  Click **More** and then **Manage Rules**.

    As no rules are defined for the selected folder, the Rules page presents you with two options to proceed.

    **Note:** Although the folder does not have its own rules, it may inherit rules from a parent folder. If this is the case, a message appears on this page.

4.  Select the desired option:

    -   **Create Rules**: Define your own rules from scratch for this folder
    -   **Link to Rule Set**: Reuse an existing rule set defined for another folder
5.  Proceed to the appropriate topic—*Creating a new rule from scratch* or *Linking to an existing rule set*—depending on how you wish to define rules for the selected folder.


-   **[Creating a new rule from scratch](../tasks/library-folder-rules-define-create.md)**  
The **Create Rules** option for a folder with no defined rules enables you to create your own rule set from scratch.
-   **[Linking to an existing rule set](../tasks/library-folder-rules-define-link.md)**  
The **Link to Rule Set** option for a folder with no defined rules enables you to reuse an existing rule set defined for another folder.
