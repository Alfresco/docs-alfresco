# Deleting a web project

Deleting a web project is much like deleting any space within Explorer. You can perform this task in the **Web Projects** space. You can also perform this task on the **Details** page or in the Sandbox view of the web project being deleted.

It is important to note that this is an irreversible task. Deleting a project removes all content within that project from the repository.

1.  Navigate to the Web Projects space \(**Company Home** \> **Web Projects**\) to display the existing web projects.

2.  Delete the web project in one of the following three ways:

    1.  Click ![Delete](../images/im-delete.png) **\(Delete\)** for the web project you want to delete.

    2.  In the **Browse Spaces** pane, click ![View Details](../images/im-viewdetails.png) **\(View Details\)** for the web project you want to delete. In the **Actions** list on the Details page, click **Delete**.

    3.  Click the name of the web project you want to delete to display the Sandbox view. In the **Actions** menu, click **Delete**.

3.  At the prompt, click **OK** to confirm the deletion of the web project.
