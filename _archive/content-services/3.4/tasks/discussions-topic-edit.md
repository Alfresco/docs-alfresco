# Editing a topic

Edit an existing discussion topic to modify or add to the content. Only a Site Manager, a Site Collaborator, and the user who created the topic can edit it.

This task assumes you are in the Discussions page component of the desired site.

1.  In the topic list, locate the discussion topic you want to edit.

2.  Click **Edit** to the right of the topic you want to edit.

    Optionally, view the topic in its entirety to ensure you have selected the correct topic and then select **Edit** on the topic page.

    The Edit Topic page appears displaying the selected topic.

3.  Make the desired changes to the topic title and content.

    Use the features provided to format the text; insert bulleted and numbered lists; color the text and background; and insert or edit links, anchors, and images. To assist with editing, use the undo, redo, and remove formatting features as needed. Additional features are also provided; position the cursor over an icon to display its function.

    Click and drag the bottom right corner to resize the text editor.

4.  Edit the tags for this topic as necessary.

    You can add and remove existing tags, or create new tags.

5.  Click **Save**.

    The updated topic appears as users will see it. The text \(Updated\) appears after the title.

6.  Click **Discussions Topic List** to return to the main view.
