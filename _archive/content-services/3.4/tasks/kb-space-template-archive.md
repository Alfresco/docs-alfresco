# Adding an archived space

Adding an Archived subspace inside your Knowledge Base space template lets you store documents that have been moved into an archived lifecycle state.

1.  Click the Knowledge Base Project space template to navigate into the Knowledge Base Project space.

2.  Click the Create menu and select Create Space from the list.

3.  On the Create Space page, name the new space “Archived” with a capital “A”. You can give it any description you like.

4.  Click Create Space to create the Archived space.

    When the Knowledge Base space refreshes your Archived folder displays.
