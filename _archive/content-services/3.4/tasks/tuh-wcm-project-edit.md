# Editing the web project settings

You edit the web project details in the Edit Web Project Wizard. This wizard allows you to edit the basic web project details, configure the web forms, and configure the web project workflow.

As the steps for editing a project in this wizard are identical to the steps for creating a project in the Create Web Project Wizard, this topic provides an overview of the steps required to edit a web project. For full details, please refer to the topic [Creating a web project](tuh-wcm-project-create.md).

Use the **Next** and **Back** buttons to walk through the steps in the **Create Web Project Wizard**.

1.  Navigate to the Sandbox view of the web project you want to work with.

2.  In the **Actions** menu, click **Edit Web Project Settings**.

    The Edit Web Project Wizard opens.

3.  In Step One, Web Project Details, edit the basic web project details as required and click **Next**.

    The **DNS name** and **Webapp** are not editable.

4.  In Step Two, Configure Deployment Servers, add, edit, and remove servers as necessary.

    -   To specify a deployment server, refer to the topic [Creating a web project](tuh-wcm-project-create.md).
    -   To edit an existing deployment server, click ![Edit Deployment Server Details](../images/im-edit.png) **\(Edit Deployment Server Details\)**, make the necessary changes, and click Save.
    -   To remove a deployment server from the current project, click ![Delete Deployment Server](../images/im-delete.png) **\(Delete Deployment Server\)**.
5.  In Step Three, Configure Web Content Forms, add web forms in the **Select Web Forms** list to the current web project and then configure the web forms in the **Selected Web Content Forms** list for generating the website content.

    To create a new web form, click **Create Web Form**. The new web form will be added to the **Select Web Forms** list. It is also added in the Web Forms space \(**Company Home** \> **Data Dictionary**\).

6.  In the **Selected Web Content Forms** list, configure the selected web forms as follows:

    1.  Click **Web Form Details** to edit details of the selected web form for the current web project. Click **OK** to save the updated details.

    2.  Click **Configure Workflow** to configure the workflow defaults for this web form within the current web project. This does not configure workflow for the web project as a whole. Click **OK** to save the workflow configuration for the web form.

    3.  Click **Configure Templates** to configure the rendering engine templates to use for each web form within the current web project. Click **OK** to save the template configuration for the web form.

        To remove a web form from the project, click ![Remove](../images/im-delete.png) **\(Remove\)**.

7.  In Step Four, Configure Workflow, edit the existing web project workflow as required. The workflow defined in this step will be applied to all content not generated by forms, as well as form-generated content without a defined workflow.

    To remove a workflow from the project, click ![Remove](../images/im-delete.png) **\(Remove\)**.

8.  In Step Five, Summary, review the information and click **Finish** to save the updated web project.
