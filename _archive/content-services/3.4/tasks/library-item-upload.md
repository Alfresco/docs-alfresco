# Updating content

The **Upload New Version** action enables you to update a content item in the document library with content from your computer.

This task assumes you are in the Document Library page component of the desired site.

You must perform this action on an item in the **I'm Editing** view to upload a new version of the content to the document library and check in \(release the lock on\) the item. You can also use this action on an unlocked content item to update it without first downloading it to your computer.

1.  Navigate the library to locate the content item you want to update.

    **Note:** Click **Iâ€™m Editing** in the **Documents** section of the browsing pane to view the content items you currently have checked out.

2.  In the item list, position the cursor over the item you want to update to display the available actions.

3.  Click **Upload New Version**.

    The Update File page appears.

4.  Click the browse button.

5.  Locate the file on your computer that you want to upload and click **Open**.

    The selected item appears in the list. Click **Remove** to delete the item, if necessary.

6.  Indicate if the revision is minor or major.

7.  In the **Comments** box, type any information relevant to the updates.

8.  Click **Upload File\(s\)**.

    An indicator informs you of the upload progress. When 100% appears beside the file, you can proceed.

9.  Click **OK**.


The page closes and the item is updated. If you updated a checked out item, it is removed from the item list in the **I'm Editing** view.
