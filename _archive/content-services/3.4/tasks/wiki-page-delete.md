# Deleting a wiki page

Delete a wiki page you no longer want to appear in the wiki for the current site. You can perform this task from both the wiki list and the page view.

This task assumes you are in the Wiki page component of the desired site.

1.  In the wiki list, locate the wiki page you want to delete.

2.  Click **Delete** for that page.

    If the wiki page you want to delete is already open in the page view, simply click **Delete** on that page.

    A message prompts you to confirm the deletion.

3.  Click **Delete** to delete the current wiki page.
