# Performing actions on multiple items and folders

Once you select the library items and/or folders you want to work with, you can select an action to perform.

This task assumes you are in the Document Library page component of the desired site and you have selected the items and/or folders you want to work with.

The **Selected Items** list in the header displays the actions available to be performed on multiple items. They are:

-   **Copy to…**

    Copies the selected items/folders to a single location that you specify. This can be in the same site, a different site, or a space in the Explorer repository.

-   **Move to…**

    Moves the selected items/folders to a single location that you specify. This can be in the same site, a different site, or a space in the Explorer repository.

-   **Delete**

    Deletes the selected items/folders.

-   **Assign Workflow**

    Assigns identical workflow, as specified, to the selected items.

-   **Manage Permissions**

    Assigns identical permissions, as specified, to the selected items/folders.

-   **Deselect All**

    Clears the check boxes of the currently selected items/folders.


To perform an action on the selected library items and/or folders:

1.  Click **Selected Items** in the header.

    A list displays the available actions.

2.  Click the desired action.

    Click **Deselect All** to clear the selected items. When you select this option, you cannot perform another action until you reselect the desired library items.
