# Working with space templates

You can use templates that you create or that are provided to accelerate the setup of a space and to ensure consistency across multiple spaces.

In this scenario, you will set up a project space with multiple sub spaces in which you will collaborate with other team members to create, approve, and publish documents. Part of the requirements you have for this space are provided by a template.

1.  Navigate to your home space \(you can use the breadcrumb path or click **My Home** on the toolbar\).

2.  In the **Create** menu, click **Advanced Space Wizard**. The Create Space Wizardpage displays.
