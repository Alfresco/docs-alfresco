# Creating a blog post

Create a new blog post to add information or a commentary related to the current site.

This task assumes you are in the Blog page component of the desired site.

When you create a new post, you can save it as a draft without publishing it or you can immediately publish it to the current siteâ€™s blog. You also have the option of publishing the post to both the internal blog and a configured external blog.

1.  Click **New Post**.

    The Create Blog Post page appears.

2.  Type a **Title** for the post.

3.  Type the post content in the **Text** box.

    Use the features provided to format the text; insert bulleted and numbered lists; color the text and background; and insert or edit links, anchors, and images. To assist with editing, use the undo, redo, and remove formatting features as needed. Additional features are also provided; position the cursor over an icon to display its function.

    Click and drag the bottom right corner to resize the text editor.

4.  Optionally, add existing or create new tags for the blog post:

    The newly associated tags appear beneath the **Text** box. Click a tag to remove it.

5.  Save or publish the new blog post:

    -   Click **Save as Draft** to save the post without publishing it. The post will not appear in the post list.
    -   Click **Publish Internally** to publish the post to the internal blog, making it available for other users of this site.
    -   Click **Publish Internally and Externally** to publish the post to both the internal and external blogs.
    The new post appears as users will see it. The text \(Draft\) appears after the title if the post remains unpublished.

6.  Click **Blog Post List** to return to the main view.
