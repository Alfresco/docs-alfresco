# Browsing the topics

The browsing feature in the Discussions page component enables you to filter the discussion topics. This allows you to more easily navigate the content.

This task assumes you are in the Discussions page component of the desired site.

The browsing pane on the left side of the page enables you to display a subset of the discussion topics by selecting a specific view or a tag.

The **Topics** list in the browsing pane provides the following options for browsing discussion topics:

-   **All**

-   **My Topics**

    Displays the topics created by the current user


In the **Tags** list, the browsing pane displays all tags currently associated with one or more discussion topics.

**To browse the discussion topics:**
