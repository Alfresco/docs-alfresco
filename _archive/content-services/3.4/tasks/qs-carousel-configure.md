# Configuring the Home page carousel

The carousel template component at the top of the Home page in the demo website is a static asset collection in the **root** section. With this asset collection, named **news.featured**, you can manually select the content you wish to display.In this example, three web assets—each one an HTML Article residing in **Alfresco Quick Start \> Quick Start Editorial \> root \> news**—are associated with the asset collection. Each asset is defined with a title, description, and primary image. It is this content that displays in the carousel.

This task assumes you are in the Document Library page component of the Quick Start site and that the **Show Folders** feature is enabled.

1.  Navigate to **Alfresco Quick Start \> Quick Start Editorial \> root \> collections**.

2.  Locate the folder **news.featured** and click **Edit Metadata** in the associated action list.

    The value in the **Maximum Size** field indicates the maximum number of assets that can be associated with this template component.

    The **Web Assets** list indicates the content currently selected to display in the carousel.

3.  Click **Select** beneath the **Web Assets** label to edit the content associated with the carousel. You can add and remove assets.

    On the Select page, the right column displays the assets already associated with the carousel. The left column displays the repository structure, which you navigate to locate the desired assets.

    The button at the top of the repository structure indicates your current location in the repository. Click this button to display the full path; click a location in the path to return to that point. Click the up arrow to return to the previous level in the hierarchy.

    1.  To add a web asset, navigate the structure in the left column and click **Add** to the right of the assets you wish to associate with the carousel.

    2.  To remove a web asset currently associated with the carousel, click the **Remove** icon to the right of the asset in the right column.

    3.  Click **OK** to save the changes.

4.  Click **Submit**.

    In the Quick Start website, navigate to the Home page to view the changes. Refresh the page if the changes are not immediately visible.
