# Creating a new group

The Admin Console enables you to create both top level user groups and subgroups within existing groups.

1.  On the toolbar, expand the **More** menu and click **Groups** in the Tools list.

2.  On the Groups page, click **Browse**.

    The leftmost pane displays all top-level user groups.

3.  Navigate to the user group where you want to create the new group.

    -   To create a top-level group, click the **New Group** icon at the top of the initial pane.
    -   To create a subgroup, browse the group structure to locate the desired parent group. Select this group and then click the **New Subgroup** icon at the top of the pane immediately to the right.
    The New Group page appears. Fields marked with an asterisk \(\*\) are required.

4.  Complete the required user details.

5.  Click **Create Group**.

    If you intend to immediately create another group at the same level, click **Create and Create Another**. This creates the group specified and clears the fields without returning you to the Groups page.
