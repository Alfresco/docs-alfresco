# Viewing a blog post

Browsing the blog displays the existing posts in the main window of the Blog page component. These posts display in either a summary view or a simple list. Viewing a post allows you to see the full contents of the post.

This task assumes you are in the Blog page component of the desired site.

Although you can perform actions on a post from the main page, viewing a post enables you to confirm you have selected the correct post before performing irreversible actions, such as deleting and publishing the post. While the same actions are available in both views \(**Edit**, **Publish Externally**, and **Delete**\), you must view a post to add a comment to it.

1.  Browse the blog posts to locate the post you want to view.

2.  Click the title of the post or click **Read** beneath the post.

    If the main page displays the simple view, you must click the title of the post.

    The post view displays the selected blog post in its entirety, along with any related comments.

3.  Click **Blog Post List** to return to the main view.
