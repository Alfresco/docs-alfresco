# Changing a user's password

You must change a userâ€™s password separately from editing the user account.

It is important to remember that passwords are case sensitive.

1.  In the toolbar, click ![Administration Console](../images/im-adminconsole.png) **\(Administration Console\)**.

2.  Click **Manage System Users**.

3.  On the Manage System Users page, use the search feature to locate the user whose account you wish to edit or click **Show All** to display all users.

    Selecting to display all users may take some time if there are many users in the system.

4.  Click ![Change Password](../images/im-user-password.png) **\(Change Password\)**for the user of interest.

5.  On the Change Password page, enter and confirm the new password for this user in the **Password** and **Confirm** boxes.

    The password is case sensitive.

6.  Click **Finish** to process the change.

7.  Click **Close** to return to the Administration Console.
