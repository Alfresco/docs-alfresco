# Creating a web project

You create a web project using the **Create Web Project Wizard**. The wizard automates the creation of a source repository, called a *Staging Sandbox*, and a set of development repositories, called *user sandboxes*. The number of user sandboxes created corresponds to the number of users invited to work on the web project.

There are seven main steps involved in creating a web project:

-   Specify basic web project details
-   Indicate if you are creating a new project or using the structure of an existing project
-   Configure deployment servers
-   Select and configure the web forms to be used with this project for generating web content
-   Configure workflow for content added to this project that is not generated by a web form
-   Select the users who will work on the web project and assign user roles to them
-   Email a notification to the invited users

You can set up the entire web project at once or do it in stages. Only the first two steps are required; once you complete these, you can save the web project.

The Web Projects space is created automatically when you install WCM 2.1.

1.  Navigate to the Web Projects space \(**Company Home** \> **Web Projects**\).

2.  In the **Create** menu, click **Create Web Project**.

    The Create Web Project Wizard opens.

3.  In Step One, Web Project Details, enter the basic web project details as follows.

    1.  Provide a **Name** and **DNS name**. Both entries are required.

        The entry in the **Name** box will be displayed in the repository as the project name. The **DNS name** provided will be used by the virtualization server to preview and test the website or web application contained within the web project. The DNS name must be alphanumeric only and cannot contains spaces.

    2.  Enter a **Title** and **Description** for the web project, if desired.

    3.  Select the check box **Use as a template?** to indicate this web project can be used as a template when creating a new web project.

    4.  In the **Preview Provider** list, select the desired method for previewing this web project.

4.  Click **Next**.

5.  In Step Two, Create From Existing Web Project, specify if you are creating a new empty project or if you are basing the new project on an existing web project.

    You can base your web project on any existing project, whether or not it has been specified as a template for web projects. When you do this, the web forms, workflow, users, and Staging Sandbox structure configured for the selected web project are copied to the web project being created.

    -   To create the web project from scratch, select **Create a new empty Web Project**.
    -   To base the new web project on an existing project, select **Create a Web Project based on an existing one**. In the list of template web projects, select the web project on which you want to base the new project. If the desired project does not appear, click **Show All Web Projects** beneath the list and then make your selection.
6.  Click **Next**.

7.  In Step Three, Configure Deployment Receivers, specify the deployment receiver\(s\) for this web project. You can specify multiple receivers in this step.

    1.  Click **Add****Deployment Receiver**.

    2.  Provide the server details.

        The **Host** and **Port** are required. The **Host** is the host name of the destination server, which can be a name or an IP address. The **Port** is the RMI port on the destination server that you want to connect to. The default values are 44100 for a standalone deployment engine and 50500 for a repository backed deployment engine.

    3.  Click **Add**.

    4.  Configure additional receivers in the same manner, as necessary.

8.  In Step Four, Configure Web Content Forms, click **Add to List** to the right of the web form you want to use with this web project.

    The **Select Web Forms** list displays the available web forms. To create a new web form, click **Create Web Form** beneath the list. The new web form will be added to the **Select Web Forms** list. It is also added in the Web Forms space \(**Company Home** \> **Data Dictionary** \> **Web Forms**\).

9.  In the **Selected Web Content Forms** section, click **Web Form Details** and follow these steps to edit details of the selected web form for the current web project.

    The default values displayed were set when the web form was created. Configuring a web form within a web project does not affect the original form located in the Web Forms space.

    1.  Edit the **Output path pattern** as necessary. This is the path to use when saving content generated by the web form.

        Click ![Help](../images/im-help.png) for guidelines on specifying this pattern.

    2.  In the **Workflow** list, select the desired default workflow if you want content generated from this web form to follow a review procedure.

    3.  Click **OK** to save the updated details.

10. In the **Selected Web Content Forms** section, click **Configure Workflow** and follow these steps to configure the workflow defaults for this web form within the current web project.

    If the selected web form has a default workflow specified, the icon ![Workflow Warning](../images/im-workflowwarning.png) is displayed and the **Configure Workflow** button is enabled, indicating that you must configure the workflow. Note that the **Configure Workflow** feature allows you to configure workflow for a specific web form within the web project; this does not configure workflow for the web project as a whole.

    1.  In the **Type of Review** list, select **Serial** or **Parallel**.

        Select **Serial** to allow only one reviewer to review the file at a time. Once the first review is complete, the file is passed to the next reviewer in the chain. Select **Parallel** to allow several reviewers to review the file simultaneously.

        In a parallel review, the content is read-only for the reviewers. You must select **Serial** to allow the reviewers to edit the content themselves.

    2.  In the search box, type the full or partial name of the user you want to add and click **Search**.

        Leave the search box empty and click **Search** to return a list of all users. Selecting to display all users may take some time if there are many users in the system.

    3.  In the results list, click to select the user to add and click **Add to List**.

        If the review is to be serial, you must add the users in the order in which you wish them to perform the review. If the review is to be parallel, the order does not matter. In this case, use SHIFT to select multiple, consecutive users from the list and use CTRL to select multiple, non-consecutive users.

    4.  Repeat this process to add all desired users to the list.

        Click ![Remove](../images/im-delete.png) **\(Remove\)** to remove a user from the list.

    5.  Click **OK** to save the updated details.

11. In the **Selected Web Content Forms** section, click **Configure Templates** and follow these steps to configure the rendering engine templates to use for this web form within the current web project.

    You perform this step only when the selected web form is associated with one or more templates.

    1.  Click **Add to List**to the right of the template you want to associate with the web form for this web project.

    2.  For this template in the **Selected Templates** list, edit the **Output path pattern** as necessary. This is the path to use when saving content generated by the web form.

        Click ![Help](../images/im-help.png) for guidelines on specifying this pattern.

        Click ![Remove](../images/im-delete.png) **\(Remove\)** to remove a template from the list.

    3.  Click **OK** to save the template configuration for the web form.

12. While still in Step Four of the **Create Web Project Wizard**, add and configure additional web forms for this web project in the same manner, if desired.

    To remove a web form from the web project, click ![Remove](../images/im-delete.png) **\(Remove\)**.

13. Click **Next** once all web forms are configured for this web project.

14. In Step Five, Configure Workflow, click **Add to List** to the right of the workflow you want to select and configure for this web project as a whole. The workflow defined in this step will be applied to all content not generated by forms, as well as form-generated content without a defined workflow.

    You can configure a chain of reviewers. If you modify the pattern match in the **Filename pattern match** box, you can allow each reviewer to review different sections of the website or different types of content.

    For example, you could assign one user the task of reviewing content under **/assets** and another user the task of reviewing content under **/products**.

    The workflow is added to the **Selected Workflows** list on this page. The icon ![Warning](../images/im-workflowwarning.png) indicates that you must configure the workflow.

15. Click **Configure Workflow** and perform these steps to configure the workflow defaults for the current web project.

    1.  In the **Type of Review** list, select **Serial** or **Parallel**.

        Select **Serial** to allow only one reviewer to review the file at a time. Once the first review is complete, the file is passed to the next reviewer in the chain. Select **Parallel** to allow several reviewers to review the file simultaneously.

        In a parallel review, the content is read-only for the reviewers. You must select **Serial** to allow the reviewers to edit the content themselves.

    2.  In the search box, type the full or partial name of the user you want to add and click **Search**.

        Leave the search box empty and click **Search** to return a list of all users. Selecting to display all users may take some time if there are many users in the system.

    3.  In the results list, click to select the user to add and click **Add to List**.

        If the review is to be serial, you must add the users in the order in which you wish them to perform the review. If the review is to be parallel, the order does not matter. In this case, use SHIFT to select multiple, consecutive users from the list and use CTRL to select multiple, non-consecutive users.

    4.  Repeat this process to add all desired users to the list.

        Click ![Remove](../images/im-delete.png) **\(Remove\)** to remove a user from the list.

    5.  Specify a value in the **Filename pattern match** box.

        The default is **.\*** indicating that any web project file not generated from a web form will pass through the defined review process.

    6.  Click **OK** to save the workflow settings.

        In Step Five, Configure Workflow, click ![Remove](../images/im-delete.png) **\(Remove\)** to remove a workflow from the project.

16. Click **Next**.

17. In Step Six, Add Users, follow these steps to select the users for this web project and assign roles to them. If you are creating the web project based on an existing project, the users and their roles may already be assigned. Each user invited to a web project is given a sandbox for web content development.

    1.  Select **Users** or **Groups**. In the search box, type the full or partial name of the user/group you want to add and click **Search**.

        You must enter a minimum of two \(2\) characters.

    2.  In the **Results** list, click to select the users/groups to invite.

        Use SHIFT to select multiple, consecutive items; use CTRL to select multiple, non-consecutive items. Select multiple users/groups only when you want to assign them the same role.

    3.  In the **Role** list, click a role for the selected user\(s\)/group\(s\).

    4.  Click **Add to List**.

        Click ![Remove](../images/im-delete.png) **\(Remove\)** to remove a user from the list.

    5.  Add additional invitees in the same manner, as required.

18. Click **Next** once all users/groups have been added.

19. In Step Seven, Email Users, choose one of the following options:

    -   Click **No** if you do not want the invited users to be notified of the invitation by email.
    -   Click **Yes** if you want the invited users to be notified of the invitation by email, then complete the **Subject** and **Message** boxes. You can write your own message, or select a template from the **User Template** menu and click **Insert Template**.
20. Click **Next**.

21. In Step Eight, Summary, review the information and click **Finish** to create the web project as specified.

    The new web project appears in the Web Projects space.
