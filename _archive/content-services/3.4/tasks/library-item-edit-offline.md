# Editing an item offline

Editing an item offline creates a working copy of the file that is placed in the **I’m Editing** view. While the original item remains in the directory, site members are only able to view and download it. An icon indicates to users that the item is locked. Once checked out to your computer, you can edit the item and then upload the new version.

This task assumes you are in the Document Library page component of the desired site.

1.  Navigate the library’s folder structure to locate the item you want to edit.

2.  In the item list, position the cursor over the item of interest to display the available actions.

3.  Click **More** and then **Edit Offline**.

    The prompts that follow will vary depending on your selected browser.

4.  Respond to the prompts presented. When prompted to open or save the file, choose to save the file to your computer.

    Depending on your browser, you are prompted to specify a destination or the item is downloaded to a default location.

5.  Once the download is complete, close the dialog box.
