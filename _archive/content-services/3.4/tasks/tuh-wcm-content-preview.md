# Previewing web content

The preview feature enables you check the layout and content of your web project files, and test the links, before submitting the content. You can preview both folders and individual files; you can also preview the entire website or web application.

The current view of the Staging Sandbox \(the most recent snapshot\) is used as a baseline for all sandboxes in the web project. This means that each user, in their own sandbox, has a complete and dynamic view of the current, approved, and submitted content for the web project. When previewing the web project within your personal sandbox, you are seeing how the site would look if all changes in your sandbox were submitted and integrated with the current snapshot.

The virtualization server must be running in order to use the preview feature. Start the server as follows:

1.  In Windows Explorer, browse to the Alfresco root directory.

2.  Double-click **virtual\_start.bat**.

    A DOS console opens. When a message similar to `INFO: Server startup in 92753 ms` appears, the preview functionality will be available.


-   **[Previewing a folder or individual file](../tasks/tuh-wcm-content-preview-individual.md)**  
You can preview individual files in the **Modified Items** list of your sandbox. This action is also available when browsing content within a sandbox \(user or Staging\).
-   **[Previewing the web project](../tasks/tuh-wcm-content-preview-project.md)**  
You can preview the web project from both a user sandbox and the Staging Sandbox.
