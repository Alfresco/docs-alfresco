# Deleting a user

Delete a user to prevent that person from having access to the Alfresco system.

Only an Administrator can delete a user.

1.  In the toolbar, click ![Administration Console](../images/im-adminconsole.png)Â  **\(Administration Console\)**.

2.  Click **Manage System Users**.

3.  On the Manage System Users page, use the search feature to locate the user whose account you wish to edit or click **Show All** to display all users.

    Selecting to display all users may take some time if there are many users in the system.

4.  Click ![Delete](../images/im-user-delete.png) **\(Delete\)** for the user of interest.

    A message prompts you to confirm the deletion of the selected user.

5.  Click **Yes**.

6.  Click **Close** to return to the Administration Console.
