# Viewing folder details

The folder’s details page gives you access to the actions available to be performed on the folder; the comments feature; custom metadata; and other details, including the folder URL, tags, and permission settings.

This task assumes you are in the Document Library page component of the desired site and that the **Show Folders** feature is enabled.

1.  Navigate the library’s folder structure to locate the folder you want to work with.

2.  In the item list, position the cursor over the folder of interest to display the available actions.

3.  Click **View Details**.

    The details page appears. On this page, you can add a comment, or edit and delete comments that you previously created. The available actions display in the **Folder Actions** list.

4.  In the header, click the desired folder in the Location path to return to the item list for that folder.
