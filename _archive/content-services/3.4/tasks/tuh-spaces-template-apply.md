# Applying a template to a space

You can apply a template to a space to customize the space.

Before applying a template to a space, it is important to preview the available templates.

1.  Navigate to the space you want to customize.

    The space header displays the name and details of the space you are working with.

2.  In the **More Actions** menu, click **View Details**.

    The Details page appears.

3.  In the Custom View pane, click ![Expand](../images/im-expand.png) to expand the pane, if it is not open.

4.  Click **Apply Template**.

    If a template is already applied, see [Changing or removing a template applied to a space](tuh-spaces-template-changeremove.md) to perform the desired action.

5.  On the Apply Template page, select the template to apply to the space and click **OK**.

    The Custom View pane displays the selected custom view for this space.

6.  Click **Close** to return to the current space.
