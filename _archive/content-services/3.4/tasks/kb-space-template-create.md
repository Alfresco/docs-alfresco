# Creating a Knowledge Base space template

Creating a Knowledge Base space template inside Alfresco Explorer lets you quickly stamp out preconfigured workspaces that implement all your Knowledge Base functionality.

1.  In Alfresco Explorer, click Company Home.

2.  In the Navigator view on the left, expand the **Data Dictionary** space and click Space Templates.

    The Space Templates space displays with one subspace inside called “Software Engineering Project”.

3.  Click the Create menu to display options for content creation and select Advanced Space Wizard from the drop-down list.

    The Create Space Wizard displays with options for creating different kinds of spaces.

4.  In Step One-Starting Space:

    1.  Choose From scratch.

    2.  Click Next.

5.  In Step Two-Space Options:

    1.  Select the Knowledge Base Space option.

    2.  Click Next.

    The Knowledge Base Space icon displays because you configured it using the Alfresco Explorer configuration file web-client-config-knowledgebase-custom.xml.

6.  In Step Three-Space Details:

    1.  Enter the details about the Knowledge Base space you wish to create. In this example, the space template is named “Knowledge Base Project”.

    2.  Click Finish.

    A new Knowledge Base space is created.
