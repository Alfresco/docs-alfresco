# Editing a comment

You can edit a comment on a folder or individual content item to modify or add to its content. Only a Site Manager, a Site Collaborator, and the user who created the comment can edit it.

This task assumes you are in the Document Library page component of the desired site.

1.  Locate and view the content containing the comment you want to edit.

2.  Click **Edit** to the right of the comment you want to change.

    This action is available only when the currently logged in user has permission to edit the comment.

    The **Edit Comment** box appears displaying the selected comment.

3.  Make the desired changes to the comment.

    Use the features provided to format the text; insert bulleted and numbered lists; and color the text and background. To assist with editing, use the undo, redo, and remove formatting features as needed.

    Click and drag the bottom right corner to resize the text editor.

4.  Click **Update**.

    The updated comment displays.
