# Removing deleted items

Deleted items are still stored in the repository. You may want to permanently remove these items as a housekeeping activity.

1.  Click ![User Profile](../images/im-user-options.png) **\(User Profile\)** in the toolbar to display the User Profile and Settings page.

2.  In the Management pane, click **Manage Deleted Items**.

    The Manage Deleted Items page appears.

3.  Locate the item you want to remove in one of the three following ways:

    -   Type the name of the item and click **Search by Name**.
    -   Type the content and click **Search by Content**.
    -   Leave the search box blank and click **Show All**.
    The results list displays. If the search returns too many items, you can filter by date or owner.

4.  In the **Actions** list, click ![Delete](../images/im-delete.png) **\(Delete\)**.

    To delete all items listed, click **Delete Listed Items**. To delete all items in the deleted file store, click **Delete All Items** in the **More Actions** menu.

5.  Click **Yes** to confirm your selection.

    You return to the Manage Deleted Items page.
