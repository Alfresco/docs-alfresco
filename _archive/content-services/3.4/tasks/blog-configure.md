# Configuring the external blog

In addition to creating blog posts and publishing them internally within the site, you can publish the blog posts to an existing WordPress or TypePad blog. To publish the site blogs externally, you must configure the external blog details.

This task assumes you are in the Blog page component of the desired site.

1.  Click **Configure External Blog**.

    The Configure External Blog page appears.

2.  In the **Type** list, select the appropriate option:

    -   Select **wordpress** to configure the external blog to run on the WordPress blog publishing system.
    -   Select **typepad** to configure the external blog to run on a TypePad blogging service.
3.  Complete the remaining fields with the details of the external blog.

    The **URL** is the root of the external blog.

    The **User Name** and **Password** provided must be the user details of the author or administrator responsible for posting the external blog.

4.  Click **OK**.
