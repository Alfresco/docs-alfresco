# Specifying favorites

The star to the left of a folder or content item in the Document Library item list enables you to mark it as a favorite. Folders and items marked as favorites appear in the **My Favorites** view for easy access. The items, but not folders, also appear on the My Documents dashlet on the personal dashboard beneath the **Favorites** filter. You can tag any number of folders and items as favorites.

This task assumes you are in the Document Library page component of the desired site. To set a folder as a favorite, the **Show Folders** feature must be enabled.

By default, all new folders and content items display with a star outline. Once tagged as a favorite, a solid star displays.

-   In the item list, click the star to the left of a folder or content item to toggle its status as a favorite item:

    -   Click a star outline to mark the folder or item as a favorite.
    -   Click a solid star to remove the folder or item's designation as a favorite.
