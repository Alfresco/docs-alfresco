# Tagging site content

Throughout Share, you can use tags to categorize similar or related content across page components within a site. This enables you to easily locate the content again.

You can associate a tag with the following content:

-   Wiki pages
-   Blog posts
-   Discussion topics
-   Calendar events
-   Site links
-   Document Library items
-   Document Library folders

In each component, you can either create your own tags or select from a list of tags already used within the current site.

The Wiki, Blog, Document Library, Calendar, Links, and Discussions page components all contain a browsing pane. The **Tags** list in that pane displays the tags referenced by items in the current component. Clicking a tag displays the items associated with that tag. The number in parentheses indicates the number of component items referencing the tag.

In all components, tag content as follows:

-   **Add a new tag**

    Type a tag in the box provided and click **Add**. To add multiple tags, separate each tag with a space. To add a multi-word tag, place it within quotation marks \(for example, "draft material"\).

-   **Add an existing tag**

    Click **Choose from popular tags in this site** to display the existing tags used in the current site. Click a tag to associate it with the new content.

-   **Remove a tag**

    In the list of associated tags, click an existing tag to remove it.
