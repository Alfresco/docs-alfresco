# Editing a reply

You can edit a reply just as you edit a discussion topic.

This task assumes you are in the Discussions page component of the desired site.

1.  In the topic list, locate and view the desired topic.

    The topic view displays the selected topic in its entirety, along with its replies.

2.  Click **Edit** to the right of the reply you want to change.

    The selected reply appears in its entirety in an edit box.

3.  Make the desired changes to the topic title and content.

    Use the features provided to format the text; insert bulleted and numbered lists; color the text and background; and insert or edit links, anchors, and images. To assist with editing, use the undo, redo, and remove formatting features as needed. Additional features are also provided; position the cursor over an icon to display its function.

    Click and drag the bottom right corner to resize the text editor.

4.  Click **Update**.


The updated reply appears as users will see it. The text \(Updated\) appears after the name of the member who originally created the reply.
