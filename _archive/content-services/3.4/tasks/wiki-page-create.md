# Creating a new wiki page

You can create a new wiki page from both the wiki list and the page view.

This task assumes you are in the Wiki page component of the desired site.

1.  Click **New Page**.

    The Create Wiki Page page appears.

2.  Type a **Title** for the page.

    The wiki title does not support the following special characters: \* < \> \\ / . ? : and \|. When the title contains a disallowed character, the **Save** button is disabled.

3.  Type the wiki page content in the **Text** box.

    Use the features provided to format the text; insert bulleted and numbered lists; color the text and background; and insert or edit links, anchors, and images. To assist with editing, use the undo, redo, and remove formatting features as needed. Additional functionality includes the ability to insert and customize tables; insert the current date and time; and view the editor in fullscreen mode. Position the cursor over an icon to display its function.

    The **Insert Image Library** feature displays a list of images in the Document Library page component of the current site. Click a thumbnail in this list to insert the related image into the wiki page at the current cursor position.

    Click and drag the bottom right corner to resize the text editor.

    To create a link to another wiki page, type **\[\[Page Name\]\]**. If the page indicated does not exist, Share creates it; however, this is an empty wiki page and it will not appear in the wiki list until you select **Edit Page** and provide content for it.

4.  Optionally, add existing or create new tags for the wiki page.

    The newly associated tags appear beneath the **Text** box. Click a tag to remove it.

5.  Click **Save**.

    The new wiki page appears as users will see it.

6.  Click **Wiki Page List** to return to the wiki list.
