# Comparing versions

The **Visual Comparison** action enables you to do a side-by-side comparison of the version of the web project waiting to be promoted to staging and the current staging snapshot.

1.  Navigate to the Sandbox view of the web project you want to work with.

2.  Click ![Expand](../images/im-expand.png) to expand the **Content Awaiting Launch** list.

3.  Click ![Visual Comparison](../images/im-compare.png) **\(Visual Comparison\)** for the desired content set to preview it against the current snapshot.

    The window on the left displays a preview of the selected content set that is awaiting launch. This preview merges the changes submitted in that content set with the current snapshot to show the future version of the web project. The window on the right displays a preview of the current staging snapshot.

4.  Navigate the two versions of the website or web application to compare the current and future versions of the web project.
