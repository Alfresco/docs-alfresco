# Cancelling a replication job

You can cancel a job that is currently running, regardless of whether it was started automatically \(that is, it is a scheduled job\) or manually.

1.  On the toolbar, expand the **More** menu and click **Replication Jobs** in the Tools list.

2.  In the Jobs section, click the currently running job that you want to cancel.

    An icon \(![Job in Progress icon](../images/admin-job-run.png)\) to the left of the job name indicates a job is currently running.

    The Status section on the right side of the page indicates the start time of the selected job.

    **Note:** If the job was already displayed, you may need to click **Refresh** to update the status.

3.  Click **Cancel Job**.

    The job is stopped and a report is created.
