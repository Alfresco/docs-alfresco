# Configuring a static asset collection

Edit a static asset collection to manually select the web assets to be used by that collection. You can add and remove assets from an existing collection.

This task assumes you are in the Document Library page component of the Quick Start site and that the **Show Folders** feature is enabled.

1.  Navigate to **Alfresco Quick Start \> Quick Start Editorial \> root \> news \> collections**.

2.  Locate the folder **featured.articles** and click **Edit Metadata** in the associated action list.

    The **Web Assets** list displays the content currently selected for use by the asset collection **featured.articles**.

    The **Maximum Size** field is used only for dynamic asset collections.

3.  Click **Select** beneath the **Web Assets** label to edit the associated content.

    On the Select page, the right column displays the assets already selected. The left column displays the repository structure, which you navigate to locate the desired assets.

    The button at the top of the repository structure indicates your current location in the repository. Click this button to display the full path; click a location in the path to return to that point. Click the up arrow to return to the previous level in the hierarchy.

    1.  To add a web asset, navigate the structure in the left column and click **Add** to the right of the assets you wish to associate with this portion of the web page.

    2.  To remove a currently associated web asset, click the **Remove** icon to the right of the asset in the right column.

    3.  Click **OK** to save the changes.

4.  Click **Submit**.

    In the Quick Start website, navigate to the News landing page to view the changes. Refresh the page if the changes are not immediately visible.
