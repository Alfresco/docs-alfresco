# Defining Knowledge Base articles

A Knowledge Base article is a document, such as a Word document, PDF, or text file submitted by a knowledge expert. You can define metadata to wrap this Knowledge Base article for storing things on the document that are not part of the documentâ€™s internal representation, such as an internal representation of the lifecycle state \(draft, pending approval, and so on\), or a field that indicates the type of document.

This example demonstrates two methods. The second method is recommended as it is less constraining.

1.  This method creates a content type called `kb:article` and adds metadata to the `kb:article` content type.

    ```
    <types>
       <type name="kb:article">
         <title>Knowledge Base Article</title>
         <parent>cm:content</parent>
        <properties>
         <property name="kb:status">
          <title>Status</title>
          <type>d:text</type>
          <default>Draft</default>
         </property>
        <property name="kb:articletype">
          <title>Article Type</title>
          <type>d:text</type>
          <default>Article</default>
        </property>
       </properties>
      </type>
    </types>
    ```

    This code declares the `kb:article` content type and gives it two `d:text` properties: `kb:status` and `kb:articletype`. The `kb:status` property tracks the lifecycle status of the Knowledge Base article. The `kb:articletype` property describes the type of article.

    This approach may eventually prove constraining because requiring Knowledge Base articles to be typed as `kb:article` means that anyone who uses the Knowledge Base must type their content as `kb:article`. Since documents can only have one base content type, it is quite restrictive. This approach requires that any Knowledge Base articles be of either type `kb:article` or another type that extends from `kb:article`, forcing third-party applications to consider your Knowledge Base schema ahead of time.

2.  This method defines articles using content aspects.

    ```
    <aspects>
    
       <aspect name="kb:status">
          <title>Status</title>
          <properties>
             <property name="kb:status">
                <title>Status</title>
                <type>d:text</type>
                <default>Draft</default>
             </property>
          </properties>
       </aspect>
    
       <aspect name="kb:article">
          <title>Article</title>
          <properties>
             <property name="kb:articletype">
                <title>Article Type</title>
                <type>d:text</type>
                <default>Article</default>
             </property>
          </properties>
          <mandatory-aspects>
             <aspect>kb:status</aspect>
          </mandatory-aspects>
       </aspect>
    
    </aspects>
    ```

    This approach does not require rebasing the content instances onto a base type from your schema, letting you take an arbitrary content item or document and mark it as a Knowledge Base article. By doing this, the content item takes on the additional metadata \(`kb:status` and `kb:articletype`\). You could mark any number of content items this way, no matter their type. Instead of defining a Knowledge Base article content type, you can define content aspects and then mark up your content using these aspects as you see fit.

    The `kb:article` aspect has the `kb:articletype` text property on it. It also has a mandatory inclusion of the `kb:status` aspect. The `kb:status` aspect is defined as a separate aspect and defines the `kb:status` text property. You can now mark content in the Alfresco repository with the `kb:article` aspect. This means the content item will have two aspects applied: `kb:article` and, by implication, `kb:status`, and will, therefore, have two properties on it: `kb:articletype` and `kb:status`.

    Creating two aspects offers a more flexible approach as it lets you add support for other types of content. For example, you could add Knowledge Base videos by creating a Knowledge Base video aspect called `kb:video`. This aspect would have unique video-related properties on it but would reuse the same `kb:status` fields the rest of the Knowledge Base application uses. All you have to do is specify `kb:status` as a mandatory aspect for the new `kb:video` aspect.
