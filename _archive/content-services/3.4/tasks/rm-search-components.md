# Searching for components

In the Results options, the Components area allows you to select the type of components to search. You can search for Records, Record Folders, Record Categories, Record Series, plus, Frozen, and Cutoff records. For record searches, you can also search for undeclared records and vital records.

For example, to search for vital records:

1.  In the Results options area, select the checkbox for **Records**.

2.  Select the checkbox for **Vital**.

3.  In the Metadata area, select the checkbox for **Vital Record**.

4.  Click **Search**.


The Results page shows the vital records \(the Vital Record field has a value of Yes\).

**Note:** The vital records that are due for review will have the ![](../images/rm-vr-dueforreview.png) icon next to the Yes.
