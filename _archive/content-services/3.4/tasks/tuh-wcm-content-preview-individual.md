# Previewing a folder or individual file

You can preview individual files in the **Modified Items** list of your sandbox. This action is also available when browsing content within a sandbox \(user or Staging\).

1.  Navigate to the Sandbox view of the web project you want to work with.

2.  Use one of the following methods to locate the content item you want to preview:

    -   In your user sandbox \(**My Sandbox**\), click ![Expand](../images/im-expand.png) to expand the **Modified Items** list.
    -   In your user sandbox \(**My Sandbox**\), click ![Expand](../images/im-expand.png) to expand the **Web Forms** list. Click **Browse Content** to display a list of all content items within the web project that were generated from the associated web form.
    -   Click ![Browse Website](../images/im-browsewebsite.png) **\(Browse Website\)** for your personal sandbox in the **User Sandboxes** pane. In the sandbox, navigate the folder structure to locate the desired folder or file.
3.  Click ![Preview](../images/im-preview.png) \(**Preview File** or **Preview Folder** depending on your selection\).

    A separate browser window or a new tab opens displaying the selected file or folder.
