# Entering a site

You can enter a site from the My Sites dashlet on your personal dashboard. This dashlet lists all sites that you created or of which you are a member.

If the site you want to enter is not listed on the My Sites dashlet, you can search for it using the Site Finder page component.

If the desired site does not exist, click **Create Site** on this dashlet to create it.

1.  Click **My Dashboard** on the toolbar if your personal dashboard is not already displayed.

2.  On the My Sites dashlet, click the name of the site you wish to enter.


The application displays the Site Dashboard of the selected site.
