# Importing content

Once created, a new web project contains no content. Use the **Bulk Import** feature to quickly import content to populate your web project.

This feature enables you to import a WAR or ZIP file into a user sandbox. Importing the file into the specified location expands the package to its original structure. Existing content in the sandbox is not overwritten.

1.  Navigate to the Sandbox view of the web project you want to work with.

2.  Click ![Browse Website](../images/im-browsewebsite.png) or **Browse Website** of the user sandbox into which you want to import a file.

    This displays the contents of the selected user sandbox.

3.  In the **Create** menu, click **Bulk Import**.

    The Bulk Import page appears.

4.  Click **Browse** and locate the file you want to import.

5.  Select the desired file and click **Open**.

    The uploaded file is displayed in the **Uploaded Content** box.

6.  Select the option **ZIP file contains high-byte filename characters such as Japanese, Chinese or Korean** if applicable.

7.  Confirm this is the file to upload and click **OK**.

    The import may take several minutes. Once complete, the Bulk Import page closes and the sandbox displays the imported content.
