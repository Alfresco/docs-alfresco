# Editing a comment

Edit a blog comment to modify or add to its content. Only a Site Manager, a Site Collaborator, and the user who created the comment can edit it.

This task assumes you are in the Blog page component of the desired site.

1.  In the post list, locate the blog post containing the comment you want to edit.

2.  Click the post title to view the post.

    The post view displays the selected blog post and the related comments.

3.  Click **Edit** to the right of the comment you want to change.

    The **Edit Comment** box appears displaying the selected comment.

4.  Make the desired changes to the comment.

    Use the features provided to format the text; insert bulleted and numbered lists; and color the text and background. To assist with editing, use the undo, redo, and remove formatting features as needed.

    Click and drag the bottom right corner to resize the text editor.

5.  Click **Update**.

    The updated comment displays beneath the post.

6.  Click **Blog Post List** to return to the main view.
