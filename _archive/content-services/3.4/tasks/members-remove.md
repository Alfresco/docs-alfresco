# Removing a site member or site group

A Site Manager can, at any time, remove a member or a group from a site. Once removed, the user or group removed no longer has access to the site. If the site is public, an individual user can choose to rejoin the site.

This task assumes you are in the Members page component of the desired site.

1.  Beneath the banner, select **People** or **Groups** to display the appropriate search page.

    This displays either the Search for Site Members or Search for Site Groups page.

2.  Locate the site member or group you want to remove from the current site.

    The page displays the search results.

3.  Click **Remove** to the right of the user or site group you want to remove from the site.
