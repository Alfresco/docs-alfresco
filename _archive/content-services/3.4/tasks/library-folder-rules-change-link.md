# Linking to a different rule set

When a folder is linked to the rule set of another folder, you can change the association at any time by linking to a different rule set.

This task assumes you are on the Rules page in the Document Library page component and that the selected folder is linked to the rule set of another folder.

1.  Click **Change**.

    The Select rule folder to link to page appears.

2.  Select the Destination:

    -   Click **Sites** to link to a folder in a Share site.
    -   Click **Repository** to link to a space in Explorer.
3.  Specify the path, as follows, depending on whether you are copying to a Share site or an Explorer repository:

    -   When linking to a site, click the desired site in the **Site** list. For the **Path**, navigate the folder structure and click the destination folder.
    -   When linking to a repository, navigate the repository structure and click the destination space.
    In both cases, the Rules column displays the existing rule set for the selected folder or space.

    **Note:** Locations that you do not have permission to access are disabled.

4.  Click **Link**.

    The link to the original rule set is broken. The current folder is now linked to the rule set for the selected folder or space.

5.  Click **Done**.
