# Deleting a forum space

Delete a forum space to permanently remove it from the Alfresco repository.

Deleting a space also deletes all of its contents.

1.  Navigate to the forum space you want to delete.

    The space header displays the name and details of the space to be deleted.

2.  In the **More Actions** menu, click **Delete Forum Space**.

    A message prompts you to confirm the deletion of the selected forum space and all its contents.

3.  Click **OK**.
