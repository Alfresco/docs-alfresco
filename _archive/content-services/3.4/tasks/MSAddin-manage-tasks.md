# Managing your document tasks

Use the My Tasks tab to view and manage the tasks assigned to you.

1.  Click the My Tasks tab on the Alfresco panel to view all tasks currently assigned to you, in ascending due date order.

    Overdue tasks are at the top of the list, followed by tasks due today, and so on.

2.  Select the task you want to manage.

    The bottom portion of the tab displays the task's status, priority, start date, type, and complete percentage, as well as the action you are required to take for the task.

3.  Optionally, click the document to open it, either in a new web browser window or in Word.

4.  Complete the action required for the task.

    The task actions available depend on the type of task and current state of that task. For example, a **Review & Approve** task will have **Reject** and **Approve** actions.

5.  Optionally, to display the task in more detail in Alfresco Explorer, click **Manage**.

    You will need to log in to Explorer, if prompted. The details for the selected task display in a new browser window.
