# Editing a task

A task assigned to you appears in your My Tasks personal dashlet and on the My Tasks page. Each task is your responsibility and remains assigned to you until you manage it. The actions available to be performed on an assigned task vary depending on the task type, such as Adhoc, Review, and Invitation.

This task assumes you are on the My Tasks page.

1.  In the task list, position the cursor over the task of interest to display the available actions.

2.  Click **Edit Task**.

    The Edit Task page appears displaying the task details. The actions available on this page depend on the type of task selected.

    **Note:** You can also click the **Edit Task** icon for the task of interest on the My Tasks personal dashlet to access this page.

3.  Manage the selected task in one or more of the following ways:

    -   **Update**: If the task is in progress but not yet complete, you may wish to change the task status and add a comment indicating your progress, then click **Save and Close**. The task remains assigned to you.
    -   **Reassign**: Click **Reassign** and use the search field provided to locate the desired user. Click **Select** to the right of a user to reassign the task to that user.
    -   **Approve or Reject**: When you finish with a task, you can update the task status, add a comment indicating the work done, and then click either **Approve** or **Reject**. The task returns to the user who started the workflow and no longer appears in your task list.
    -   **Claim**: Click **Claim** to take responsibility for a pooled task. This action is available only for pooled tasks that are not yet assigned.
    -   **Release to Pool**: Click **Release to Pool** to place a task back in the pool. The task appears in the task list as **Unassigned** and can be claimed by another user. This action is available only for pooled tasks that are currently owned by you.
    -   **Add**: Click **Add** beneath the Items list to locate and select content items to add to the task. This action is available only for Adhoc tasks.
    -   **Task Done**: Once a task is complete, it is returned to the user who started the associated workflow. Click **Task Done** to finish a task and remove it from your task list.
    Once the selected action is complete, you are redirected to an appropriate page.
