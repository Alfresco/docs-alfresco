# Saving a search

This task assumes that you are in the Search page, viewing the results of a search query on the Results tab.

1.  Click **Save Search**.

2.  In the Name box, type a name for the search query.

3.  In the Description box, type a short explanation about what the search query returns.

4.  Click **Save**.


The saved search query name displays in the **Saved Searches** menu on the Search page.

**Note:** The saved search feature saves only the search query and not the results. This means that when you next use the saved search, you may get different results, depending on the activity in the Records Management system.

**Parent topic:**[Searching records](../concepts/rm-search.md)
