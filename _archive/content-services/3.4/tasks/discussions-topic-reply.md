# Creating a reply

Creating a reply enables you to begin or take part in a discussion related to the site. You can reply to the original discussion topic or any replies already created for that topic. Each reply is nested to visually indicate the discussion flow.

This task assumes you are in the Discussions page component of the desired site.

1.  In the topic list, locate and view the topic you want to reply to.

    The topic view displays the selected topic in its entirety, along with any existing replies.

2.  Click **Reply**.

3.  Type your content in the **Add Reply** box.

    Use the features provided to format the text; insert bulleted and numbered lists; color the text and background; and insert or edit links, anchors, and images. To assist with editing, use the undo, redo, and remove formatting features as needed. Additional features are also provided; position the cursor over an icon to display its function.

    Click and drag the bottom right corner to resize the text editor.

4.  Click **Create**.


The reply appears beneath and indented from its parent topic or reply.
