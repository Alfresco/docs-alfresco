# Taking ownership of content

You can take ownership of content from someone else.

For example, it may be that the individual who owned the content has left your company and you need to take responsibility for it.

1.  Navigate to the space containing the content item you want to own.

2.  In the Content Items pane, click ![View Details](../images/im-viewdetails.png) **\(View Details\)** for the content item of interest.

    The Details page appears.

3.  In the **Actions** list, click **Take Ownership**.

    This action is available only if you have permissions allowing you to take ownership of a content item.

    A statement appears indicating the action was performed successfully.
