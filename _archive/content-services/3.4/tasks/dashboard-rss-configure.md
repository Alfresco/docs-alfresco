# Configuring the personal dashboard RSS feed

You can configure the Alfresco Global Feed personal dashlet to display any RSS feed on your dashboard.

To perform this task, you must first configure your personal dashboard to display the Alfresco Global Feed personal dashlet. This appears as the RSS Feed dashlet on the **Customize User Dashboard** page.

1.  Click **My Dashboard** on the toolbar if your personal dashboard is not already displayed.

2.  On the Alfresco Global Feed dashlet, click **Configure**.

    The Enter Feed URL page opens.

3.  In the **URL** field, type the link of the feed you want to subscribe to.

4.  In the **Number of items to display** list, select the number of items to display on the dashlet for the specified feed.

    Select **All** to display all items available for the feed.

5.  Select **Open links in new window** to have the target story display in a new window.

6.  Click **OK**.


The Enter Feed URL page closes and the Alfresco Global Feed dashlet displays the feeds for the URL specified.
