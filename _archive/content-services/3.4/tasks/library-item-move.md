# Moving content

Move content to relocate it to another location within the current site. You cannot relocate content to a different site or a location outside Share.

This task assumes you are in the Document Library page component of the desired site. To move a folder and its contents, you must enable the **Show Folders** feature.

This feature is also available for multiple selections being moved to a common destination.

1.  Navigate the libraryâ€™s folder structure to locate the content you want to move.

2.  In the item list, position the cursor over the folder or item of interest to display the available actions.

3.  Click **More** and then **Move to**.

    The Move \[name\] to page appears.

4.  Select the Destination:

    -   Click **Sites** to move the selected content to another site in Share.
    -   Click **Repository** to move the selected content to a space in Explorer.
    -   Click **My User Home** to move the selected content to your User Home space in Explorer
5.  Specify the path, as follows, depending on whether you are moving to a Share site or an Explorer repository:

    -   When moving to a site, click the desired site in the **Site** list. For the **Path**, navigate the folder structure and click the destination folder.
    -   When moving to a repository or your User Home space, navigate the repository structure and click the destination space.
6.  Click **Move**.


The page closes and the content is moved from its original location to the specified location.
