# Taking ownership of a space

You can take ownership of a space from someone else.

It may be necessary to perform this task if the owner of a space no longer works on the project for which the space exists and you need to take responsibility for it.

1.  Navigate to the space you want to own.

    The space header displays the name and details of the space.

2.  In the **More Actions**menu, click **View Details**.

    The Details page appears.

3.  In the **Actions** list, click **Take Ownership**.

    A statement appears indicating the action was performed successfully.
