# Editing a rule

From the Rules page you can easily update individual rules for the current rule set. In addition to changing the rule definition, you can use this feature to disable a rule that you do not want to run as part of the current rule set.

**Note:** Although you can view the details for an inherited rule on this page, the **Edit** action is not available. You can edit a rule only in the folder where it was created.

This task assumes you are on the Rules page in the Document Library page component and that the selected folder has a defined rule set.

1.  In the rules list on the left side of the page, select the rule you want to edit.

    The rule appears highlighted in the list and its details appear to the right.

2.  Click **Edit**.

    The Edit Rule page appears.

3.  Edit the rule as necessary. All rule details—name, description, rule definition, and options—are available for editing.

    You can specify multiple events. Use the icons to the right of the fields to add and remove options.

    Select the **Disable rule** check box to prevent the rule from being run.

    **Note:** On this page, the symbol ![](../images/im-missinginfo.png) to the left of a condition or action indicates required information is missing. You must correct this in order to save the edits.

4.  Click **Save**.


You return to the Rules page.
