# Browsing the links

The browsing feature in the Links page component enables you to filter the links for easier navigation.

This task assumes you are in the Links page component of the desired site.

The browsing pane on the left side of the page enables you to display a subset of the links by selecting a specific view or a tag.

The **Links** list in the browsing pane provides the following options for browsing links:

-   **All Links**

    Displays all links

-   **My Links**

    Displays the links created by the current user

-   **Recently Added**

    Displays the links created in the past seven days


In the **Tags** list, the browsing pane displays all tags currently associated with one or more links.

**To browse the links:**

1.  Use the browsing pane to browse the links:

    1.  In the **Links** list, click the view representing the links you want to view. The links list displays all links in the current site that correspond to the selection.

    2.  In the **Tags** list, click the tag of interest. The links list displays all links in the current site associated with the selected tag.

2.  Click **Simple View** to display only the title and URL of the links.

    Click **Detailed View** to display the summary view.
