# Declaring a record

The next step is to declare the item as a record.

To declare an item as a record:

1.  Navigate to the uploaded document in the File Plan.

    You can declare a record by using one of the following ways:

    -   From the details page
    -   From the File Plan
2.  To declare the record from the details page:

    1.  Click the item name link.

        The record details page displays.

    2.  Click **Declare as Record**.

3.  To declare the record from the File Plan:

    1.  Position the cursor over the item.

        The actions for the item display on the right side of the items list.

    2.  Select **Declare as Record** from the actions list.


The item is declared as a record and is considered to be part of the Records Management system. The Declare as Record action also changes to show **Undeclare Record**.

Once a record is declared, it is then under the control of the record category, and the disposal schedule applies.
