# Creating the Records Management site

This task assumes that you have added the Records Management dashlet into your dashboard.

1.  On the Records Management dashlet, click **Create Records Management Site**.

    A message displays to confirm that the site had been created.

2.  Refresh the Share dashboard, either:

    -   Refresh the browser, or
    -   Logout of Share, and then logon again using the same user name and password.

The Records Management site now displays in the My Sites dashlet.
