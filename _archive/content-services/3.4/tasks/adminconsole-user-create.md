# Creating a user account

The Admin Console enables you to easily create users accounts.

1.  On the toolbar, expand the **More** menu and click **Users** in the Tools list.

    The User Search page appears.

2.  Click **New User**.

    The New User page appears. Fields marked with an asterisk \(\*\) are required.

3.  Complete the required user details.

4.  If desired, add the user to existing user groups:

    1.  In the search box, type the full or partial name of the desired group.

        You must enter a minimum of one \(1\) character. The search is not case sensitive.

    2.  Click **Search**.

    3.  In the list of returned results, click **Add** to the right of each group you want the user to be a part of.

        The groups appear beneath the Groups list. Click a group to remove it.

    4.  Perform additional searches as necessary to locate and add more groups.

5.  In the **Quota** box, specify the maximum space available for this user and select the appropriate unit \(GB, MB, or KB\).

    This information is not required. When no quota is provided, the user has no space limitations.

6.  Click **Create User**.

    If you intend to immediately create another user, click **Create and Create Another**. This creates the user account specified and clears the fields without returning you to the User Search page.
