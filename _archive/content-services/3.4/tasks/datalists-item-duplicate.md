# Duplicating a list item

To quickly and easily create a new list item, you can duplicate any existing item in the same list. This is a particularly useful action if the two items have similar details.

This task assumes you are in the Data Lists page component of the desired site and a list is displayed.

1.  In the current data list, position your cursor over the list item you want to duplicate to display the available actions.

2.  Click **Duplicate**.

    The new item is created. Its details are identical to the selected list item.

3.  Edit the new list item as necessary.
