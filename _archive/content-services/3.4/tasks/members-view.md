# Viewing site members

The Search for Site Members page enables you to search for a particular site member.

This task assumes you are in the Members page component of the desired site.

1.  Click **People** beneath the banner if this page is not already selected.

2.  In the search box, type the full or partial name of the site member you want to locate.

    **Note:** Leaving the search box empty returns a list of all members of the current site.

3.  Click **Search**.


The page displays a list of the current site members matching the criteria provided. From this list, you can change a member's role or remove a member from the site.

-   **[Inviting users to a site](../tasks/members-invite.md)**  
Invitations allows you to invite both internal and external users to join the current site. This is a multi-part process where you select the users to invite, assign a role to each user, and then issue the invitations. The available user roles are Manager, Collaborator, Contributor, and Consumer.
