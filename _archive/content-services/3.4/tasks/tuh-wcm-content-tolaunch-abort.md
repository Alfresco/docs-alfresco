# Cancelling the launch

The **Abort Submission** action enables you to cancel the pending launch before the specified launch date and time.

Performing this task removes the content set from the **Content Awaiting Launch** list so that it will not be promoted to staging. You will not be prompted to confirm this action.

1.  Navigate to the Sandbox view of the web project you want to work with.

2.  Click ![Expand](../images/im-expand.png) to expand the **Content Awaiting Launch** list.

3.  Click ![Abort Submit](../images/im-abortsubmit.png) **\(Abort Submission\)** to immediately cancel the submission of this content set to staging.

    The content set is removed from the **Content Awaiting Launch** list. The related items remain in the **Modified Items** list in your sandbox. All functionality for these items is returned. You can resubmit the content at any time.
