# Creating a simple workflow

A workflow is a work procedure where workflow steps represent the activities users must follow in order to achieve the desired outcome. Simple workflow is generated by a folder that has a defined workflow rule. The rule dictates how the content entering, leaving, or currently residing in the folder is managed.

This task assumes you are in the Document Library page component of the desired site and you have chosen to create a new rule.

The Rules feature includes a simple workflow action that enables you to set up a review and approval workflow. You configure the rule to specify the user actions and flow of the content between folders. To add complexity to simple workflow you must create rules for other folders and pass content around from location to location.

For example, you could set up rules to create a simple workflow that manages content as follows:

-   Users with the appropriate abilities can approve the content items added to the **Drafts** folder.
-   On approval, the content is moved to a folder named **Pending Approval**.
-   Users with the appropriate abilities can approve the content in this folder.
-   On approval, the content will be moved to the **Published** folder. If, however, the content is rejected in this step, it will be moved back to **Drafts**.

When you create a rule for a folder, it applies to all content items that are added to that folder after the creation of the rule. Content items residing in the folder before the rule is created are not affected by the rule. However, you can use the Run Rules actions to ensure the new rules apply to the existing content.

1.  Enter a name \(required\) and description \(optional\) for the rule.

2.  Specify the event\(s\) to trigger the rule.

    **Note:** You can specify multiple events. Use the icons to the right of the fields to add and remove options.

3.  Specify the rule conditions.

    You can use inclusive \(if\) conditions, exclusive \(unless\) conditions, or a combination of the two. Define any number of conditions per rule. Use the icons to the right of the fields to add and remove conditions as necessary.

4.  Select **Add simple workflow** as the action.

5.  To include an approval step in the workflow, click **Approve** and provide details.

    1.  Enter the display label for the approval step as it will appear in the action list.

    2.  Specify whether approving the content item involves a **copy** or **move** action.

    3.  Click **Select** and specify the destination. This can be a location in a Share site or an Explorer repository.

    4.  Click **OK**.

6.  To include a rejection step in the workflow, select the check box and click **Reject**, then provide details.

    1.  Enter the display label for the rejection step as it will appear in the action list.

    2.  Specify whether rejecting the content item involves a **copy** or **move** action.

    3.  Click **Select** and specify the destination. This can be a location in a Share site or an Explorer repository.

    4.  Click **OK**.

7.  In the Other Options section, specify additional options for the rules as desired.

8.  Click **Create**.

    **Note:** If you intend to immediately create another rule, click **Create and Create Another**. This creates the rule specified and clears the fields so you can create another rule for the same folder.


After creating the last rule, you return to the Rules page. Any new rules created are added at the end of the rule set.

In the content item list, the symbol ![](../images/im-rules-simpleworkflow.png) to the left of a content item indicates that a simple workflow has been applied to it. The approve and reject actions \(with their defined labels\) appear in the action list for these items.
