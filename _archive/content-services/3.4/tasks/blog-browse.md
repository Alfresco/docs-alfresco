# Browsing the blog

The browsing feature in the Blog page component enables you to filter the blog posts. This allows you to more easily navigate the blog content.

This task assumes you are in the Blog page component of the desired site.

The browsing pane on the left side of the page enables you to display a subset of the blog posts by selecting a specific view, a period of time \(month\), or a tag.

The **Posts** list in the browsing pane provides the following views:

-   **All**

    Displays all posts in the blog

-   **Latest**

    Displays the posts created or edited in the past seven days

-   **My Drafts**

    Displays the posts created by the current user that are saved as drafts \(not yet published\)

-   **My Published**

    Displays the posts created and published, either externally or internally, by the current user

-   **Published Externally**

    Displays all posts that have been published to an external blog


The **Archives** list organizes posts by month and year.

The **Tags** list displays all tags currently associated with one or more blog posts.

**To browse the blog posts:**

1.  Select the desired option in the browsing pane:

    1.  In the **Posts** list, click the view representing the posts you want to view.

        The post list displays all blog posts in the current site that correspond to the selection.

    2.  In the **Archives** list, click the month of interest.

        The post list displays all blog posts in the current site published during that month.

    3.  In the **Tags** list, click the tag of interest.

        The post list displays all posts in the current site associated with the selected tag.

2.  Click **Simple View** to display only the title of the posts.

    Click **Detailed View** to display the summary view.
