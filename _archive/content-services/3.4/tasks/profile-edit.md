# Editing your profile

Edit your user profile to update the information about you that is available to site members. In addition to personal and business information, you can upload a photograph.

1.  Expand the user menu on the toolbar and click **My Profile**.

    The User Profile page component appears.

2.  Click **Edit Profile**.

    Entry fields appear displaying the personal details, contact information, and company details that currently exist for your profile. Fields marked with an asterisk \(\*\) are required.

3.  Edit the user profile details, making changes and adding new information as desired.

4.  Upload a photo to accompany your profile:

    1.  Click **Upload** in the **Photo** section.

    2.  Click the browse button on the Upload File page.

    3.  Locate and upload the desired image.

        The selected file appears in the Upload File page. Click **Remove** to delete the file listed, if necessary.

    4.  Click **Upload File\(s\)**.

    If a profile photo was already in place, uploading a new photo overwrites the original.

5.  Click **Save Changes** to save the profile details.


The User Profile page component displays your updated user profile.
