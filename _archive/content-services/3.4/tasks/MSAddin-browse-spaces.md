# Browsing spaces

The Browse Spaces and Documents tab displays the name of the current space at the top of the pane. Beneath this, you see the subspaces contained in this space, and then a list of all documents and files contained within the current space.

Use the following functions on this tab to browse the spaces:

-   Click ![Display parent space](../images/MSAddin-display-parent.png) in the **Current Space** pane to navigate up one level to the parent space.
-   Click ![Display User Home space](../images/MSAddin-display-userhome.png) in the **Current Space** pane to navigate to the User Home space.
-   Click a subspace to make it the current space.

**Note:** Clicking an item in the **Documents** list either opens the document in Word \(.doc files\) or loads the content in a new browser window.
