# Adding items to the File Plan

This task assumes you are in the File Plan page of the Records Management site.

1.  Navigate to the folder where the item\(s\) being uploaded will reside.

2.  Click **File**.

    The Filing Type page displays.

3.  Indicate whether the item you are filing is either an electronic record or non-electronic record. Select either:

    -   **Electronic Record**, or
    -   **Non-electronic Record**

-   **[Filing an electronic record](../tasks/rm-electronic-file.md)**  
Electronic records are files that are uploaded into the Alfresco Records Management repository.
-   **[Filing a non-electronic record](../tasks/rm-nonelect-file.md)**  
Non-electronic records may be paper files or papers that can be stored in a physical location. The non-electronic record in Alfresco Records Management provides a record of the existence of the file and the details of where it is physically stored.
