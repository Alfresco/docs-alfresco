# Managing rules

Once a folder has rules, the **Manage Rules** action displays the Rules page. The information provided and the actions available on this page vary depending on whether the rules are defined for or linked to the folder.

This task assumes you are in the Document Library page component of the desired site and that the **Show Folders** feature is enabled.

1.  Navigate the library’s folder structure to locate the folder you want to work with.

    The symbol ![](../images/im-rules-icon.png) to the left of a folder indicates that rules are already defined for it.

2.  In the item list, position the cursor over the folder of interest to display the available actions.

3.  Click **More** and then **Manage Rules**.

    The Rules page for the selected folder appears, which indicates if the selected folder has its own set of defined rules or has been linked to another folder’s rule set. The actions available vary depending on the scenario.

4.  Proceed to the topic *Working with a defined rule set* or *Working with linked rules* as appropriate.


-   **[Working with a defined rule set](../concepts/library-folder-rules-defined.md)**  
Manage the defined rule set on a folder to add, delete, and edit individual rules; mark a rule as inactive; and change the order in which the rules are run. You can also manually run rules.
-   **[Working with linked rules](../concepts/library-folder-rules-linked.md)**  
Manage the linked rules on a folder to change the link to a different rule set or break the link completely.
