# Viewing a list

The **Lists** section of the browsing pane displays the existing data lists for the current site. Once displayed in the main view, you can apply filters to view only specific list items.

This task assumes you are in the Data Lists page component of the desired site.

The **Items** list in the browsing pane provides the following options for filtering the rows displayed in the current list:

-   **All**

    Displays all list items

-   **Recently Added**

    Displays the list items created in the past seven days

-   **Recently Modified**

    Displays the list items modified in the past seven days

-   **Created by Me**

    Displays the list items created by the current user


1.  In the browsing pane, click the list you want to view.

    The main view displays the selected list in its entirety. When a list contains more items than can be displayed on a single page, navigation links at the top and bottom of the list become enabled.

2.  Use the **Previous** and **Next** links, or select the desired page number, to navigate between the pages of list items.

3.  In the **Items** list, click the view representing the list items you want to display.

    The current list displays the list items in the current data list that correspond to the selection.

4.  In the table, click the column headings to sort the results as desired.
