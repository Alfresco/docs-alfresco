# Posting a message to a topic

You can post a message to an existing topic.

Two views are available when browsing posts: **Bubble View**and **Details View**. The selected view is displayed in the space header. In Bubble View, posts and replies are represented differently, so you can more easily see the discussion flow.

**Note:** To change the view in the Browse Posts pane, click the current view \(**Bubble View** or **Details View**\) and select the alternate view.

1.  Navigate to the topic you want to post a message to.

    The space header displays the topic subject; the Browse Posts pane displays the posted message and details, as well as any existing replies.

2.  In the **Create** menu, click **Post to Topic**.

3.  In the **Message** box, type your message and click **Post**.

    The topic is posted in the Browse Posts pane.
