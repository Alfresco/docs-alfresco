# Viewing a link

Browsing the links list displays the existing links in the main window of the Links page component. These links display in either a summary view or a simple list. Viewing a link allows you to see the full link details and any related comments.

This task assumes you are in the Links page component of the desired site.

Although you can perform actions on a link from the main page, viewing the link enables you to confirm you have selected the correct one before you edit, delete, or comment on it.

1.  Browse the links to locate the one you want to view.

2.  Click the title of the link to display the full details with any related comments.

    The link view displays the selected link in its entirety, along with any comments.

3.  Click **Links List** to return to the main view.
