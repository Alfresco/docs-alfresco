# Deleting a sandbox from a web project

Deleting a userâ€™s sandbox removes that user and all content contained within the sandbox from the web project. This does not affect the web project as a whole. The delete action cannot be reversed.

1.  Navigate to the Sandbox view of the web project you want to work with.

2.  Locate the user sandbox you want to remove from the web project and in the **More Actions** menu, click **Delete**.

    A message prompts you to confirm the deletion of the selected sandbox.

3.  Click **OK**.
