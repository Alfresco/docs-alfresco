# Customizing a site

Customizing a site enables you to choose the page components you want to include for the site. By default, all components—Wiki, Blog, Document Library, Calendar, Links, Discussions, and Data Lists—are included when you create a site. Only the Site Manager can customize the site. Once you customize the site, you can customize the site dashboard, which provides a summary of the available page components.

1.  Enter the desired site.

2.  On the dashboard banner, click **More** and then **Customize Site**.

    The Customize Site page displays the current page components for this site.

3.  To remove a page component from the site, click the **Remove** icon beneath the page component.

4.  To add a page component to the site:

    1.  Click **Add Pages** to display the available page components.

    2.  In the **Select New Page** section, click **Select** to the right of the component you want to include in the site.

5.  Click **OK** to save your changes.


You return to the site dashboard. The banner displays the selected page components in the order configured.

With the site customized, you can now customize the site dashboard to display information that is relevant to the site.
