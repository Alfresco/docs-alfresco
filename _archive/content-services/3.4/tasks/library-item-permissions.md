# Managing content permissions

There are four roles, or groups, available to categorize Share users: Manager, Collaborator, Contributor, and Consumer. Share allows you to manage permissions for library items by changing a group's default permissions for a folder \(and its content\), an individual content item, or a group of content items.

This task assumes you are in the Document Library page component of the desired site. To manage permissions for a folder, you must enable the **Show Folders** feature.

This feature is also available for multiple selections.

1.  Navigate the libraryâ€™s folder structure to locate the content whose permissions you want to define.

2.  In the item list, position the cursor over the folder or item of interest to display the available actions.

3.  Click **More** and then **Manage Permissions**.

    The Manage Permissions for \[name\] page appears. A button to the right of each group displays the current permissions.

4.  For each group whose permissions you want to change, click the button to the right of the group and select the desired permission from the list displayed.

    Selecting **No privileges** blocks the users with that defined role from having any access to the currently selected content. The content will not even appear in the document library to these users. Note that Site Managers always have full privileges within a site.

    Click **Use Defaults** to return the settings to their default values.

5.  Click **Save**.


The page closes and the group permissions are set as defined for the specified library content.
