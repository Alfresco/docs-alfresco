# Specifying favorite sites

The star to the left of the site name on the My Sites dashlet enables you to mark a site as a favorite. Sites marked as favorites appear in the **My Favorites** list in the **Sites** menu for easy access. You can tag any number of sites this way.

By default, standard sites display with a star outline. Once tagged as a favorite, the site displays a solid star. Sites created by you are automatically added to your **My Favorites** list.

-   Click the star to the left of a site to toggle its status as a favorite site:

    -   Click a star outline to mark the site as a favorite, adding it to the **My Favorites** list.
    -   Click a solid star to remove the site from the **My Favorites** list.
