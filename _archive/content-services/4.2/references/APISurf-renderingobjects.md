# Rendering objects

There are multiple steps to the Surf page rendering process. At specific stages different objects are in context to scripts and, therefore, different root objects are available to each of those rendering objects.

-   **[templates](../references/APISurf-templates.md)**  
The `templates` object.
-   **[components](../references/APISurf-components.md)**  
The `components` rendering object.
