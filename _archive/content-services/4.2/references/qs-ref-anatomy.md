# Breaking down the Web Quick Start site structure

The content for the Web Quick Start website resides in the Document Library page component of Alfresco Share.

The topics in this reference section detail the structure of the **Alfresco Quick Start** folder hierarchy in the document library. These topics examine the site structure and content in Share and explain their relationship to the demo website.

-   **[Alfresco Quick Start folders](../references/qs-ref-tree-toplevel.md)**  
The Quick Start demo site in Share is separated into two main folders: **Quick Start Editorial** and **Quick Start Live**. This folder structure provides a separation between the content that is being authored by the editorial team and the finished, reviewed, and published content that is visible on the live website.
-   **[Sections](../references/qs-ref-tree-sections.md)**  
This section provides additional information for using the Web Quick Start demo in Share.
-   **[Subsections](../references/qs-ref-tree-subsections.md)**  
Both the **news** and **publications** sections contain subsections, which appear as sub-menu items in the website header.
-   **[Collections](../references/qs-ref-tree-collections.md)**  
Every section includes a **collections** subfolder, which is used to manage the asset collections for that section.
