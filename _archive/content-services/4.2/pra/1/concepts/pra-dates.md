# Date and Time format

Dates in the JSON response object are encoded as character strings using the extended format defined by ISO 8601:2004 They are always in UTC.

You can find the ISO 8601:2004 [here](http://www.iso.org/iso/catalogue_detail?csnumber=40874). Here's an example of what to expect in a date/time string in a JSON response:-

```
"createdAt" : "2012-07-20T21:46:09.659+0000"
```
