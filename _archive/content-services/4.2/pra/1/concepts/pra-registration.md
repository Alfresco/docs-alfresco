# Registering your application

To use the Alfresco One API, your application must first be registered with the Alfresco Developer Portal.

Go to [https://www.alfresco.com/develop/cloud](https://www.alfresco.com/develop/cloud) and sign up. When your account is approved, you can register your application. You must provide a callback URL and a scope. The callback URL is the part of your application that exchanges the authorization code for an access token. The scope should always be set to `public_api`. call.

Once your application is approved, The **Auth** tab will show an **API Key**, and a **Key Secret**. These will be needed by your application for authorization.
