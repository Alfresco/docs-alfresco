# Alfresco REST API

The Alfresco REST API lets you manage alfresco-specific features of content in an on-premise Alfresco repository, and in Alfresco cloud from your own applications.

The API gives your application access to Alfresco Networks, Sites, Containers, Comments, Ratings, tags, and workflow objects. Response and request bodies are all specified with simple JSON.

-   **[API Reference](../../../pra/1/concepts/pra-resources.md)**  
This reference material has a description of each of the Alfresco entities operated on by the REST API, and of the methods that are available for each of those entities.
