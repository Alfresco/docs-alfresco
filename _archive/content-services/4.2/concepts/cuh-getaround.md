# Getting around in Alfresco

Once familiar with the user interface features of Alfresco, it is important to know how to use them to perform standard tasks, such as navigating the spaces, configuring the Alfresco interface, and performing searches.

-   **[Navigating spaces](../tasks/tuh-navigation.md)**  
The **Navigator** enables you to easily navigate the spaces in the Alfresco repository.
-   **[Changing the space appearance](../tasks/tuh-appearance-change.md)**  
You can set the preferred view for displaying spaces and content in the working area.
-   **[Using the clipboard](../tasks/tuh-clipboard-view.md)**  
In the **Shelf** view of the sidebar, expand the **Clipboard** to view and use Alfresco content that has been collected using the **Cut** and **Copy** actions.
-   **[Using shortcuts](../concepts/cuh-shortcut.md)**  
In the **Shelf** view of the sidebar, expand **Shortcuts** to display the shortcuts to spaces and/or content items that you have created. Shortcuts can save you time navigating the repository in search of spaces and content you use often.
-   **[Finding content and spaces](../concepts/cuh-search.md)**  
The search bar on the right side of the toolbar enables you to quickly perform both basic and advanced searches.
