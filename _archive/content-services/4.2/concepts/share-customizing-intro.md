# Customizing Alfresco Share

Alfresco Share provides a rich web-based collaboration environment for managing documents, wiki content, blogs and more. Share leverages the Alfresco repository to provide content services and uses the Alfresco Surf platform to provide the underlying presentation framework.

A number of options are available to developers and administrators for customizing Alfresco Share to better fit into their environment. Many of these mechanisms are provided by the underlying Surf framework, therefore a knowledge of Surf is considered useful for anyone wishing to implement substantial customizations.

This section of the documentation looks at customizing Share through configuration files. Customizing Share through more advanced techniques in discussed in the [Developing Share Extensions](dev-extensions-share.md) section.
