# News

In the Quick Start Share site, the **root \> news** section drives the content and configuration of the News landing page and its subsections—the Global Economy, Companies, and Markets pages—on the Quick Start website.

The topics in this section use the News content to explore functionality that allows you to create an article, associate an image with an article, and edit asset collections to select website content.

-   **[Writing a news article](../tasks/qs-article-write.md)**  
Create an article in the Quick Start Share site so that it can then be added to asset collections to be included as website content. Content created within the Quick Start Editorial branch of the site is automatically given the type `ws:article`.
-   **[Selecting an image to accompany an article](../tasks/qs-image-select.md)**  
Associate an image with an article to have it appear alongside the article on various pages of the Quick Start website.
-   **[Selecting articles for the landing page](../concepts/qs-articles-select.md)**  
You use asset collections—collections of web assets—to populate the Quick Start website pages with the desired content from the Quick Start site in Share. The two types of asset collections, static and dynamic, enable you to manually select the desired web assets or automatically generate assets from a query run on a configured interval.
