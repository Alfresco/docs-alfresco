# Searching for content

The search field on the Alfresco toolbar lets you quickly perform both basic and advanced searches.

This feature can return the following content:

-   library items and folders
-   wiki pages
-   blog postings
-   calendar events
-   site-related web links
-   discussion topics
-   data lists and list items

When you perform a search from your personal dashboard, the result set displays the matches found in all sites.

When you perform a search from within a site, three result sets are offered: matches found in the current site, matches found in all sites, and matches found in the repository. By default, the result set for the current site is displayed.

When you perform a search from within the repository, two result sets are offered: matches found in the repository and matches found in all sites. By default, the result set for the repository is displayed.
