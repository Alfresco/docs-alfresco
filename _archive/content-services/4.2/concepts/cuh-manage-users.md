# Managing users

In Alfresco a home space is a place for users to store their items.

By default a user has full control over items in their space and other users are given guest access to that space.

Users can navigate to their home space by clicking **My Home** in the toolbar.

-   **[Creating a user](../tasks/tuh-user-create.md)**  
The New User Wizard enables you to create a new user, creating the user’s home space at the same time.
-   **[Editing user details](../tasks/tuh-user-edit.md)**  
The Edit User Wizard enables you to modify the person and user properties of a user’s account.
-   **[Changing a user's password](../tasks/tuh-user-password.md)**  
You must change a user’s password separately from editing the user account.
-   **[Deleting a user](../tasks/tuh-user-delete.md)**  
Delete a user to prevent that person from having access to the Alfresco system.
