# Building the library

You build a site library by creating an organized folder structure then adding content to it.

There are two ways to add content to a library: create new content in the library or upload existing content from your computer.

-   **[Organizing folders](../tasks/library-create-folder.md)**  
The **Library** section of the explorer panel displays the folder structure for the current site. A new site contains only the root folder, Documents. Add new folders here to create or add to the library structure.
-   **[Creating folders from a template](../tasks/library-folder-template.md)**  
As well as creating folders from scratch, you can also create folders from templates.
-   **[Adding content to a library](../concepts/library-add-content-intro.md)**  
You can add both existing content from outside Alfresco and create new content within a site to populate the document library.
