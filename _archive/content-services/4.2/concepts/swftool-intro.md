# Installing SWF Tools

Alfresco Share uses the pdf2swf utility of the SWF Tools for previewing PDF files. The pdf2swf utility generates one frame per page of fully formatted text inside a Flash movie. To install the pdf2swf utility, you must install the complete SWF Tools.

-   **[Installing SWF Tools on Windows](../tasks/swftool-install.md)**  
This section describes the steps used to install the SWF Tools.
-   **[Installing SWF Tools on Linux](../tasks/swftool-install-lin.md)**  
This section describes the steps used to install the SWF Tools. Alfresco Share uses the features provided in the development snapshots of the tools. For Linux, there is no binary version, so you need to compile a development snapshot.
