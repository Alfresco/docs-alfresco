# Using MySQL

The Maven Alfresco SDK can be configured to use a MySQL database server rather than the default option of the H2 database engine.

By default, the Maven Alfresco SDK uses H2 as its database, but it can be configured to use other databases such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, or DB2. [MySQL](http://www.mysql.com) is a commonly used open source database. The following tutorials looks at how the Maven Alfresco SDK can be configured to use MySQL rather than H2 as the main database for Alfresco, for both Simple AMP projects and All-in-One projects.
