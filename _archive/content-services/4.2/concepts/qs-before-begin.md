# Before you begin

The Web Quick Start demo includes two different sets of sample website data, each one representing a different industry.

The user responsible for creating the Quick Start site in Share selects the desired industry and imports that data into the empty site. The options are:

-   Finance
-   Government

The structure of each Share site is the same: the sample sites have the same number and arrangement of sections. The differences between the sites are found in some folder names and titles, and the images provided.

For the purpose of this document, all examples reference the **Finance**sample site.
