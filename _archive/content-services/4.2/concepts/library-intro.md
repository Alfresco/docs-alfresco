# Working with content

A site Document Library is where you store and manage content, such as documents, images, and videos.

You can upload content to share and work on with other site members. Users can view and work on this content, depending upon their permission settings.

Document Library activities appear in the Site Content dashlet so you can see at a glance the content that's been added and updated.

-   **[The Document Library](../tasks/library-access.md)**  
Access the site Document Library to view and work with the content in the current site.
-   **[Building the library](../concepts/library-build.md)**  
You build a site library by creating an organized folder structure then adding content to it.
-   **[Viewing content in detail](../concepts/library-folder-intro.md)**  
To get a closer look at an item without downloading it, you can view it on the Document Details page. This gives you more detail, a preview, and access to social features, actions, and version history.
-   **[Working with individual library items](../concepts/library-items-individual.md)**  
Once the document library is populated with content items, site members can access and work with individual items stored in the library. In addition to adding more content, members can view, download, edit, and delete content items.
-   **[Applying rules to folders](../concepts/library-folder-rules.md)**  
In the library you can define folder rules to manage your content automatically. You can come up with many creative solutions to make sure specific content processes are automated all without you having to do the work yourself.
-   **[Keeping your library organized](../concepts/library-organize.md)**  
With different people creating folders and adding content, your library could become a bit disorganized. There are several features available to help you keep content labelled, organized, and filed correctly.
-   **[Using social features](../concepts/library-share-opinion.md)**  
In Alfresco you can use social features to like, favorite, and comment on content.
-   **[Working with content outside the library](../concepts/library-external.md)**  
While the Document Library is the focal point for working with content in Alfresco, there are also a few other areas available to you.
-   **[Working with replicated content](../concepts/replicated-content.md)**  
Alfresco administrators can configure Alfresco so that content is replicated across multiple repositories. Content items and folders created as the result of a replication job display the **Transferred from another Repository** icon in the item list.
