# Working with individual library items

Once the document library is populated with content items, site members can access and work with individual items stored in the library. In addition to adding more content, members can view, download, edit, and delete content items.

-   **[Editing library content](../concepts/library-item-edit-intro.md)**  
There are multiple ways to edit document library content. These options are available whenever suitable for a content type.
-   **[Downloading content](../tasks/library-item-download.md)**  
You can quickly download content from Alfresco so that you have a local copy.
-   **[Sharing content](../tasks/library-item-share.md)**  
You can easily share an item - even with people who don't have an Alfresco account. Clicking the **Share** action generates a URL that you can send by email or publish using social networking websites.
-   **[Publishing content](../tasks/library-item-publish.md)**  
The publishing feature lets you deliver library content to Flickr, YouTube, and SlideShare. When you publish the selected content you can also publicize the event by posting a message through sites such as Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn.
-   **[Managing aspects](../tasks/library-item-manage-aspects.md)**  
You can use aspects to add extra functionality, properties, or options to content. Alfresco provides you with a list of default aspects.
-   **[Restricting mobile access](../tasks/restrict-mobile-access.md)**  
You can use the Restrictable aspect to set access restrictions on content that's viewed on Alfresco Mobile apps.
-   **[Managing content permissions](../tasks/library-item-permissions.md)**  
You can override the default site permissions for any content you add to the document library. This lets you control what site members can see and do with your content.
-   **[Changing the content type](../tasks/library-item-change-type.md)**  
 You can change an items content type from its default to a more specific value.
