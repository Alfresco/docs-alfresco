# User interface

The user interface provides navigation, access to content, and a working area.

The user interface includes three main areas: the toolbar, the sidebar, and the working area.

-   **[Toolbar](../concepts/cuh-toolbar.md)**  
The toolbar contains a navigation area with buttons that lead to the various spaces: **Company Home**, **My Home**, **Guest Home**, and **My Alfresco**.
-   **[Sidebar](../concepts/cuh-sidebar.md)**  
The sidebar appears to the left of the working area and can contain one of four features: **Navigator**, **Shelf**, **OpenSearch**, and **Categories**. The sidebar defaults to the **Navigator**.
-   **[Working area](../concepts/cuh-workspace.md)**  
The working area is a dynamic area displaying items relevant to the selected space and the task you are performing.
-   **[My Alfresco Dashboard](../concepts/cuh-dashboard.md)**  
The **My Alfresco Dashboard** is a configurable area where you can select from a list of pre-configured layouts and components to construct your own page.
