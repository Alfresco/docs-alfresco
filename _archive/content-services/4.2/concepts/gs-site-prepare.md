# Working with content

Before you begin working with content in Alfresco, we'll look at the two different concepts of content there are in Alfresco.

The first is content that is actually part of Alfresco features themselves, such as updates to a wiki, a new blog posts, or forum discussions.

The second is content items such as documents, spreadsheets, or images that are stored in the Document Library. These can be uploaded or created directly from Alfresco.

So now that you know the differences in content types, it's time to start adding content to your site.

-   **[Adding content to Alfresco](../tasks/gs-content-add.md)**  
First you'll look at adding content items such as documents, spreadsheets, presentations, and images to a site.
-   **[Editing content](../tasks/gs-content-update.md)**  
Updating your content in Alfresco is easy to do and you can even select whether to edit online, offline, or in Google Docs.
-   **[Creating content](../tasks/gs-intro-create.md)**  
As well as uploading content to Alfresco, you can also create content right in Alfresco.
