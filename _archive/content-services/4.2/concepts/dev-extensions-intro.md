# Alfresco Extensions

This section of the documentation looks at developing extensions for Alfresco. Alfresco can be freely customized and extended according to your needs. These customizations can be as simple as tweaking a single configuration file, or the development of a sophisticated module such as Records Management. This documentation also covers approaches with regards development and deployment strategies, looking at topics such as suitable packaging and distribution techniques.

-   **[Extension development practices](../concepts/dev-extensions-packaging.md)**  
There are several ways of developing extensions. The best method for your project will depend on how complex your extension is, how many extensions you will be deploying, your environment \(such as which app server you are using\), which version of Alfresco you are on, and your development culture.
-   **[Packaging techniques](../concepts/dev-extensions-packaging-techniques.md)**  
There are various ways of packaging Alfresco extensions.
-   **[Modules](../concepts/dev-extensions-modules-intro.md)**
