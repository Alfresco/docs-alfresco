# Admin QuickStart

This quickstart guide is intended to provide you with simple instructions on how to download and install Alfresco. Use this guide if you are upgrading or clustering an installation of Alfresco.

It is designed for users who just need a checklist to follow. For detailed step-by-step instructions for installing and upgrading Alfresco, seeÂ the [Installing](master-ch-install.md) and [Upgrading](ch-upgrade.md) sections.

-   **[QuickStart installing guide](../concepts/quick-install.md)**  
This section provides instructions on how to install Alfresco on a single instance and in a distributed and clustered environment.
-   **[QuickStart upgrading guide](../concepts/quick-upgrade.md)**  
This section provides instructions on how to upgrade Alfresco on a single instance and in a distributed and clustered environment.
-   **[Alfresco Day Zero Configuration Guide](../concepts/zeroday-overview.md)**  
By default, Alfresco configuration is optimized for single user evaluation of Alfresco. This configuration minimizes resource usage at the expense of scalability \(particularly scalability in the presence of large concurrent traffic volumes\). Therefore, for any other use of Alfresco \(including but not limited to QA, performance/scalability testing, production, production mirror, and disaster recovery\), Alfresco strongly recommends that additional configuration be performed.
