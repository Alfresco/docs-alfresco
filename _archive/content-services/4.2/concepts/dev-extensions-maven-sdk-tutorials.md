# Maven Tutorials

These tutorials show you how to use the Maven Alfresco SDK to create some basic projects, including a web script extension and a Java-backed web script extension. They show the basics of using the Alfresco AMP archetype and the Alfresco All-in-One archetype, provided by the SDK.

-   **[Using the Alfresco AMP archetype](../tasks/dev-extensions-maven-sdk-tutorials-amp-archetype.md)**  
The Maven Alfresco SDK Alfresco AMP archetype can be used to create an AMP-based project. This is used for simple, single module applications.
-   **[Using the Alfresco All-in-One archetype](../tasks/dev-extensions-maven-sdk-tutorials-all-in-one-archetype.md)**  
The All-in-One archetype of the Maven Alfresco SDK can be used to create a comprehensive multi-module project.
-   **[Creating a simple module](../tasks/dev-extensions-maven-sdk-tutorials-creating-a-simple-module.md)**  
This task demonstrates how you can incorporate your customizations into the all-in-one project and create a simple module that runs on Alfresco.
-   **[Creating a Java-backed web script](../tasks/dev-extensions-maven-sdk-tutorials-java-backed.md)**  
This task demonstrates how you can create a Java-backed web script and build and deploy it using the Maven Alfresco SDK.
-   **[Maven Alfresco SDK with Eclipse](../tasks/dev-extensions-maven-sdk-eclipse.md)**  
The Maven Alfresco SDK is designed to work well with Eclipse. This support includes the ability to import existing Maven projects into Eclipse.
-   **[Creating a Share project with Eclipse](../tasks/dev-extensions-maven-sdk-eclipse-share.md)**  
The integration between the Maven Alfresco SDK and Eclipse allows you to create new projects conveniently from within the IDE. This tutorial focuses on creating a Share customization project from within the Eclipse IDE.
-   **[Remote debugging with Eclipse](../tasks/dev-extensions-maven-sdk-eclipse-remote-debugging.md)**  
It is possible to start an application ready for remote debugging by using the Maven `mvnDebug` command
-   **[Using JRebel](../concepts/dev-extensions-maven-sdk-tutorials-jrebel-intro.md)**  
Using JRebel for Test Driven Development \(TDD\)
-   **[Using MySQL](../concepts/dev-extensions-maven-sdk-tutorials-mysql-intro.md)**  
The Maven Alfresco SDK can be configured to use a MySQL database server rather than the default option of the H2 database engine.
-   **[Maven and Alfresco Enterprise](../concepts/dev-extensions-maven-sdk-tutorials-alfresco-enterprise.md)**  
By default the Maven Alfresco SDK will use Alfresco Community artifacts, however, it can be configured to use Enterprise artifacts. This requires access credentials for the Alfresco Private Repository, and the modification of several Maven configuration files.
