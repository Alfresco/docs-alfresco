# Using Remote APIs

Remote APIs allow clients connecting from a separate tier to communicate with the Alfresco content application server. Remote APIs are based on web services and RESTful and CMIS protocols, and are language agnostic, allowing you to develop against these APIs using a range of languages including Java, PHP, Ruby, and .NET.

There are several Remote APIs available, including:

-   **Alfresco API for Cloud Content** - The Alfresco API lets you access content managed by Alfresco Cloud from your own applications. The API is RESTful, which means each call is an HTTP request, so you don't even need a programming language to try it out. Further information can be found on the [Alfresco Developer Portal](https://www.alfresco.com/develop/cloud).
-   **RESTful** - HTTP-based resource oriented interfaces used by the Surf framework and Alfresco Share. More information can be found in the [RESTful API Reference](../references/RESTful-intro.md).
-   **CMIS** - a standard that defines web services and REST-based bindings for working with CMIS compliant repositories. Further information can be found in the [CMIS guide](../pra/1/topics/cmis-welcome.md).

-   **[Using the RESTful API to retrieve document tags](../tasks/api-tags-retrieve.md)**  
 This is a simple example of using a Remote API to retrieve a list of tags for a document.
