# Admin Console: General settings

The General section on the Admin Console contains pages for managing your Alfresco license, viewing information about the repository, and the system settings.

-   **[Uploading a new license](../tasks/at-adminconsole-license.md)**  
The access and use of Alfresco is managed by your license. The license is a file that you upload into Alfresco, which sets limits on the maximum number of users and a maximum number of content objects that you can use. Your limitations are set when you purchase the license from Alfresco. To increase the limitations, contact Alfresco to obtain a new license.
-   **[Repository information](../tasks/adminconsole-repoinfo.md)**  
The Repository Information section shows details of the Alfresco repository as it was originally installed. It will also show the current Alfresco version.
-   **[System settings](../tasks/adminconsole-systemsettings.md)**  
The System Settings page shows your server settings, the Alfresco web application repository settings, and the Alfresco Share application settings.
