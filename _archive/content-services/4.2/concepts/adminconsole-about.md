# About the Alfresco Admin Console

The Alfresco Admin Console is a standalone console for managing the administration of the Alfresco repository.

The Admin Console is a tool comprising separate pages that identify a particular administrative activity or feature. The pages in the Admin Console are:

-   System Summary
-   Email Services
-   General
-   Google Docsâ„¢
-   Repository Services
-   Support Tools
-   Authentication directories
-   Virtual File Systems

You can use the Admin Console as your main tool to help you manage your Alfresco production environment. It is a simple alternative to using a JMX console, or manually setting properties in the alfresco.global.properties file.

The settings that you choose in the Admin Console will take precedence over any setting that you add in the alfresco.global.properties file.
