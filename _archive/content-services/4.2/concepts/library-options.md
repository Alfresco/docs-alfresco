# Library view options

The **Options** menu in the **Document Library** lets you customize how you view Alfresco content.

The default view for the library is **Detailed View**. This view displays the basic details for each item as well as a thumbnail, description, tags, and social features \(Favorite, Like, Comment, and Share\). **Simple View** just displays the basic details for each item.

You can use the other view options to get a more visual representation of site content, or to view content in a more basic table format.

At the bottom of the **Options** menu you can click to **Set** or **Remove** the current view as the default view for the folder you're in.

In all viewing options, just click an item name to open the Document Details page. Click a folder name to open that folder so you can view its contents.

With **Media View** and **Audio View** you'll see extra item information.

If you select one of the more visually rich views, the way you interact with content changes slightly. Here are some useful features you'll find in these views.

-   **Resize the thumbnails**

    ![Size slider](../images/GV-slider.png)

    Use the resizing bar to make the thumbnails larger and smaller. This lets you choose how much detail you see in the main view so you can either quickly scan many smaller images or preview larger ones without needing to view the details page.

-   **Display the information panel**

    Click the ![Information icon](../images/ico-information.png) Information icon to display content details and available actions.

-   **Select content**

    Click the check box on an item or folder to select it. In **Gallery View** you can select multiple items, in **Filmstrip View** just one.


In the **Options** menu you can also show and hide folders or the breadcrumb trail, switch to full screen or full window view, or even set up an **RSS Feed** for the folder, see [Subscribing to an RSS feed](../tasks/site-subscribe-rss-feed.md).
