# Managing Alfresco Content from within Microsoft Office

This tutorial introduces using Microsoft Office to manage your Alfresco content.

Microsoft SharePoint Protocol technology enables Content Management \(CM\) to be used within Microsoft Office applications. The Content Management functionality mirrors that of SharePoint.

There are several ways to work with the SharePoint features of Microsoft Office. This tutorial highlights these features, including what Alfresco Share does and does not support. Differences between the Alfresco support and the standard SharePoint integration are identified for users already familiar with SharePoint.

The audience for this tutorial is users of Microsoft Office 2003 and 2007 on Windows. The procedures are documented using Microsoft Office 2007 only.

**Note:** Microsoft Office 2010 onwards doesn't include a Document Management panel for working with the Alfresco repository from Microsoft Office, but you can still use the online editing feature in Alfresco. You can reopen documents stored in Alfresco by clicking **File** then **Recent** in a Microsoft Office program and selecting the document.
