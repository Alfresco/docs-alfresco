# Editing library content

There are multiple ways to edit document library content. These options are available whenever suitable for a content type.

The **Edit Offline** action lets you download an item to your computer so you can edit it there. This locks the item in the library to prevent others from editing the item simultaneously. It's available for every content item.

The **Edit Online** action lets you edit the content item without first saving it offline. It's available only for Microsoft Office 2003 or greater files.

The **Inline Edit** action lets you edit plain text, HTML, or XML documents directly in the document library. It's available for these content types, which can all be created with the **Create Content** feature in the library.

The **Edit in Google Docs** action lets you work with items in Google Docs. Like the **Edit Offline** action, this locks the item in the library while it is being edited. It's available for supported document, presentation, and spreadsheet formats.

-   **[Editing content offline](../tasks/library-item-edit-offline.md)**  
When you edit an item offline it's downloaded to your computer and locked in the library, so that other users can't overwrite it while you make changes offline.
-   **[Editing content inline](../tasks/library-item-edit-inline.md)**  
You can edit plain text, HTML, and XML content items directly in Alfresco.
-   **[Editing Microsoft Office content online](../tasks/library-item-edit-online.md)**  
You can edit Microsoft Office content without having to save it to your computer first. An invisible check-out action makes sure items stay protected \(locked\) in the library while you're editing them. When you finish editing the item, it's invisibly checked back in so the updated version is available to other users.
-   **[Editing content in Google Docs](../tasks/library-edit-content-googledocs.md)**  
The **Edit in Google Docs** action is available for any library item that can be edited in Google Docs. Common document, presentation, and spreadsheet formats are supported.
-   **[Editing content properties](../tasks/library-item-edit-metadata.md)**  
Edit the basic details of a library folder or content item to change its name, description, and tags.
-   **[Uploading new versions](../tasks/library-item-upload.md)**  
You can upload content from your computer to update a file.
