# Content auditing customizations

There are two customizations available:

-   Creating a custom audit filter
-   Creating a custom configuration

-   **[Custom audit filter](../concepts/audit-cust-auditfilter.md)**  
The most common customization is to change the default audit filter values.
-   **[Custom audit configuration](../concepts/audit-cutom-audit-config.md)**  
The most common reason to customize the audit configuration is if there is a need to extract individual property or aspect values that have special meaning to a particular Alfresco installation.

**Parent topic:**[Content auditing](../concepts/audit-content.md)
