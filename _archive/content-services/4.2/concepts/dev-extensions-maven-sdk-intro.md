# Maven Alfresco SDK

The Maven Alfresco SDK is a community project that provides an easy to use approach to developing applications and extensions for Alfresco.

With this SDK you can develop, package, test, run, document and release your Alfresco extension project.

The Maven Alfresco SDK includes a number of archetypes. These archetypes aim to provide a standardized approach to development, release and deployment of Alfresco extensions. The following project types are available:

1.  Alfresco AMP archetype: the Alfresco AMP archetype is a sample fully featured project to manage AMP \(Alfresco Module Package\) projects. This archetype can be used both for Alfresco Repository and Alfresco Share AMPs.
2.  Alfresco all-in-one archtype: the Alfresco all-in-one archetype is a multi-module project, leveraging Maven Alfresco SDK's powerful capabilities to customize and run the full Alfresco platform embedded and all its components. The archetype does not require additional download and provides a perfect starting point for full-blown Alfresco projects.
