# Managing space users

Once users have been invited to a space with defined roles, also referred to as permissions, you can manage the space users.

When a user or group is invited to a space and given a role, they have permissions to that space and its sub spaces in the specified capacity. The owner of the space can remove users and groups from the space. The owner can also change the roles assigned to the invited users and groups.

You can specifically set permissions on a sub space or you can have the space take the permissions of the parent space. When selected, the check box **Inherit Parent Space Permissions** on the Manage Space Users page indicates that all content contained in the current space, as well as all sub spaces, will have the same permissions as the parent space.

-   **[Changing users' roles for a space](../tasks/tuh-spaces-changeuser.md)**  
Users and groups can have multiple roles within a space. You can add, change, and remove those roles as needed.
-   **[Removing users from a space](../tasks/tuh-spaces-removeuser.md)**  
Remove a user or group from a space when you no longer want them to have access to the content within that space.
