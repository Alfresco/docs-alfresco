# Audit service

The Audit service provides a configurable record of actions and events. It collects information and stores it in a simple database form.

The Audit service includes the ability to:

-   Audit system events \(user and system-triggered\)
-   Audit metadata changes, including before and after values
-   Audit data stored in database-indexed tables according to the type of data
