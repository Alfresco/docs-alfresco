# Publications

In the Quick Start Share site, the **root \> publications** section drives the content and configuration of the Publications landing page and its subsections—the Research Reports and White Papers pages—on the Quick Start website.

Out of the box, the Quick Start Share site is configured to automatically create a PDF rendition and thumbnail image of any Office content \(.doc/.docx, .ppt/.pptx, .xls/.xlsx\), and the Open Office equivalents, that you upload to the site. The **publications** section of the Share site is designed to demonstrate how to easily publish this PDF content.

-   **[Creating and publishing PDF content](../tasks/qs-content-publish.md)**  
Out-of-the-box and defined configurations make the process of creating and publishing PDF content simple. Upon upload, Microsoft Office \(or Open Office equivalent\) content is automatically converted to PDF format, along with a thumbnail image. Editing the item metadata enables you to provide a title and description that will appear when published. Publishing simply involves adding the web asset to the desired asset collection.
