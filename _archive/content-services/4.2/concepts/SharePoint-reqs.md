# Prerequisites for using SharePoint Protocol

The SharePoint Protocol module lets you manage Alfresco content from within Microsoft Office. To use SharePoint with Alfresco from an Microsoft Windows Client machine, you need to install an essential update from Microsoft. This update is applicable to certain Windows operating systems only.

The software update is not applicable to all Microsoft Windows operating systems; for example, it is not applicable to Windows 7. A full explanation and a list of the supported operating systems is given in [Description of the Software Update for Web Folders](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/907306).

**Important:** Do not install this software update on a Windows 7-based machine. The update cannot be un-installed and can lead to an unsupported Windows 7 system.

See the Microsoft Download Center [Software Update for Web Folders \(KB907306\)](https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/kb/907306) to download the update. Without the update you will not be able to access Alfresco content from within Microsoft Word.
