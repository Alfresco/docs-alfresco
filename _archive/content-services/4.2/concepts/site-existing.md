# Accessing existing sites

Accessing an existing Alfresco site is easy. You can search for sites using the Site Finder, or you might receive an email invitation to a site.

If you see a link to a site anywhere in Alfresco, just click the link to have a look.

-   **[Joining a site](../tasks/sites-manage.md)**  
When you join sites you gain access to the content that's stored on them.
-   **[Leaving a site](../tasks/sites-leave.md)**  
It's quick and easy to leave a site when you no longer want to be a member.
-   **[Entering a site](../tasks/dashboard-site-enter.md)**  
You can access a site from several places in Alfresco.
-   **[Moving round a site](../tasks/page-select.md)**  
The default areas available in a site are the **Site Dashboard**, **Document Library**, and the **Site Members** area. If a site has additional site features then you'll also see a **More** menu.
