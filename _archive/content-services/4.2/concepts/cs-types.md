# Content store types

By default, Alfresco is configured to save files or content items in the File content store and orphaned files in the Deleted content store. Alfresco also provides other content stores, which may be used in place of or in addition to the default stores. This section gives an overview on the File content store and additional content stores that you can use with Alfresco.

-   **[File content store](../concepts/cs-file.md)**  
This topic describes the File content store, which is Alfresco's default content store.
-   **[Alfresco S3 content store](../concepts/cs-s3connector.md)**  
The Alfresco S3 Connector is an add-on module that provides an alternative content store. It uses Amazon's Simple Storage Service \(S3\) as the storage mechanism for Alfresco, allowing for virtually unlimited and inexpensive storage.
-   **[Replicating content store](../concepts/cs-replicating.md)**  
A Replicating content store is a content store implementation that is able to replicate content between stores. This topic provides information on Replicating content store and its configuration details with an example.
