# Reviewing a user's profile

When you search for a user, you can view their profile details.

The profile details are organized across several pages:

-   **Info**

    Displays the user's personal details, including contact information, company details, and a photo.

-   **Sites**

    Lists the sites the user belongs to.

-   **Content**

    Displays two lists detailing the user's recent site activities.

    The **Recently added** list displays the last three pieces of content that the user added to any site. This includes wiki pages, blog postings, library content, and discussion items. The **Recently modified** list displays the last three pieces of content the user edited.

-   **Following \(\#\)**

    Displays a list of people the user is following.

    The number to the right of the page label indicates how many people are currently being followed by this user. If the user has marked their list as private, this page will not appear in the profile.


**Note:** When you view a user's profile, these pages display only the sites and content that you have permission to view.
