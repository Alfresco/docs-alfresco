# Customizing Explorer and Share

This section of the documentation provides guidance and reference for customizing and extending Alfresco Explorer and Share.

Explorer is the older interface, but is still useful for carrying out many tasks and will be familiar to you if you've used earlier versions of Alfresco. Share is the newer interface, and has had a number of features added in this release to enhance extensibility. The look and feel of the Share UI has also been refreshed for this release.

 Alfresco Share provides a rich web-based collaboration environment for managing documents, wiki content, blogs and more. Share leverages the Alfresco repository to provide content services and uses the Alfresco Surf platform to provide the underlying presentation framework.
-   **[Customizing Alfresco Explorer](../concepts/dev-explorer.md)**  
Alfresco Explorer provides a web-based user interface providing document management, collaboration, and administration capabilities.
