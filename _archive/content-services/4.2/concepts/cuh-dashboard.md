# My Alfresco Dashboard

The **My Alfresco Dashboard** is a configurable area where you can select from a list of pre-configured layouts and components to construct your own page.

When configuring your dashboard, each component you select is displayed as a pane on the dashboard. The available components are as follows:

-   **Getting Started**

    The Getting Started component displays helpful information for getting started, including links to an Alfresco demonstration, a feature tour, and the online help system. Descriptions of some common tasks you may want to perform are also included.

-   **My Tasks To Do**

    The My Tasks To Do component displays all incomplete tasks assigned to you. In this pane you manage and reassign your tasks.

-   **My Pooled Tasks**

    The My Pooled Tasks component displays all pooled tasks relevant to you. These will be pooled tasks assigned directly to you or tasks assigned to a group that you belong to. In this pane you manage and reassign your tasks.

-   **My Completed Tasks**

    The My Completed Tasks pane displays all tasks that you have completed. In this pane you can view and cancel workflow related to a completed task.

-   **OpenSearch**

    This component displays the OpenSearch pane on your dashboard, which provides the ability to search across multiple repositories. This is the same search pane that is displayed in the sidebar.

-   **Document List**

    The Document List component displays the documents within your home space. In this pane you can view the document details, preview the document, and perform various actions on the content item without leaving the dashboard, including Check Out, Check In, Update, Delete, Edit Details, and Download. Use the document type filter in this pane to specify the information to display: All Items, Word Documents, HTML Documents, PDF Documents, or Recently Modified.

-   **My Spaces List**

    The My Spaces List component displays the current repository. In this pane you can navigate the repository from the dashboard and perform various actions, including creating spaces, uploading content, and viewing content items. Use the filter in this pane to specify the type of information to display: All Items, Spaces, Documents, My Items, or Recently Modified.

-   **My Tasks**

    The My Tasks component displays all incomplete tasks assigned to you. In this pane you can filter the tasks by due date \(Due Today, Next 7 days, No due date, Overdue\) and manage the tasks. This component is similar to the My Tasks To Do component but with a different user interface.

-   **My Web Forms**

    The My Web Forms component displays the web projects you have been invited to and the web forms associated with each project. This pane enables you to preview a web project, create web content from a web form, and display the Sandbox view for a project – all from the dashboard.

-   **My Web Files**

    The My Web Files component displays the web projects you have been invited to and the Modified Items list from your sandbox for each project. This pane enables you to edit and preview individual content items, preview a web project, and display the Sandbox view for a project – all from the dashboard.
