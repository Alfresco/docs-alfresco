# Modify Alfresco applications

You can configure Alfresco by modifying, adding, or deleting properties and attributes in the properties files. This topic describes the different properties files you can modify to apply configuration changes to Alfresco.

-   [Updating system configuration parameters](configuration-overview.md): You can configure Alfresco for your specific environment requirements either by using the Alfresco Admin Console, or by editing the alfresco-global.properties file, or by using a JMX client.
-   [Alfresco Share](share-customizing-intro.md): A number of options are available to customize Alfresco Share. To configure the Share application, you can use the configuration file named share-config-custom.xml.sample.
-   [Solr configuration files](solr-config-files.md): When you install Alfresco, several Solr-related configuration files are made available to you. To configure Solr, you can use the configuration file named solrcore.properties.

**Note:** Remember not to use the default user names, URLs or passwords with different environment.

**Note:** You can customize or scale up Alfresco to meet your login and security requirements. See [Setting up Alfresco authentication and security](auth-intro.md) for more information.
