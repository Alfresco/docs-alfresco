# Managing a site

Creating a site is quick and simple. You can then customize it to build a fully functional project site.

When you create a new site, you are automatically made the manager. This gives you full access to the site features.

-   **[Creating a site](../tasks/sites-create.md)**  
You can create a site from anywhere in Alfresco, and are automatically made the manager of the site you create \(a site *can* have multiple managers\).
-   **[Customizing a site](../tasks/site-customize.md)**  
Once you've created a site you can customize it to add extra features.
-   **[Customizing the site dashboard](../tasks/site-customize-dashboard.md)**  
Like your user dashboard, site information is organized and displayed in dashlets. As a site manager you can change the site layout, choose dashlets, and configure the display order.
-   **[Editing site details](../tasks/sites-edit-details.md)**  
You can change the name, description, and visibility of a site after it is created.
-   **[Favoriting a site](../tasks/sites-favourites-menu.md)**  
You can mark a site as a favorite to add it to the Favorites list in the Sites menu. This lets you quickly access the site from anywhere in Alfresco. You can mark any number of sites this way.
-   **[Deleting a site](../tasks/sites-delete.md)**  
Delete a site to permanently remove it.
