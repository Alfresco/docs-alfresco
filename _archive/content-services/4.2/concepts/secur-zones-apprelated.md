# Application-related zones

Application-related zones, other than the default, hide groups that implement RBAC like roles. Application zones, by convention, start APP. and include:

-   APP.DEFAULT is for person and group nodes to be found by a normal search. If no zone is specified for a person or group node, they will be a member of this default zone.
-   APP.SHARE is for hidden authorities related to Alfresco Share.
-   APP.RM will be added for authorities related to RM.
