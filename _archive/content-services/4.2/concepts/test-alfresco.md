# Test and familiarize after configuring Alfresco

You have successfully installed and configured Alfresco. The aim of this section is to make sure that the features and customizations you have added, are operational.

Here are some of the tips to help you test your Alfresco customizations.

**Note:** Alfresco recommends that you create one or two test sites for testing purpose and put all your test data in those sites. After finishing the tests, you can delete the test sites in order to clear your database.

-   If you have installed Records Management, can you use it search records in the Alfresco repository. See [Using Records Management](http://docs.alfresco.com/rm2.2/concepts/rm-intro.html).
-   If you have installed and configured Microsoft Office SharePoint Protocol Support, can you edit a document in the Alfresco repository using Microsoft Office. See [Managing Alfresco Content from within Microsoft Office](gs-spp-intro.md).
-   If you have installed and configured Alfresco Kofax Release script, can you use it to capture and publish content. See [Installing and configuring Alfresco Kofax Release script](kofax-intro.md).
