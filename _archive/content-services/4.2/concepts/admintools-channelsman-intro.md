# Managing social content publishing

Social content publishing allows you to use content from Alfresco to publish out through other social platforms or delivery mechanisms.

The current out-of-the-box support is for the following social platforms:

-   Facebook
-   Flickr
-   Linkedin
-   SlideShare
-   Twitter
-   YouTube

Any content asset from the document library can be published to any appropriate publishing channel.

The framework allows you to develop and plug-in additional channels.

-   **[Creating a Bitly user for social publishing](../tasks/admintools-channelsman-bitly.md)**  
 Within the social content publishing feature, Alfresco uses Bitly as the default URL shortener for publishing tweets and Facebook updates. To ensure that the URL shortener works from Alfresco, you need to subscribe to Bitly to generate an API Key, and then apply the user name and API key to configure Alfresco.
-   **[Create a new channel](../tasks/admintools-channelsman.md)**  
Create new channels on the Channel Manager page.
-   **[Changing a channel permission](../tasks/admintools-channel-permission.md)**  
Permissions can be granted to users and groups for each publishing channel.
-   **[Authorizing a channel](../tasks/admintools-channel-reauth.md)**  
You can authorize a channel from the **Channels Management** page.
-   **[Deleting a channel](../tasks/admintools-channel-delete.md)**  
 You can delete channels from the **Channels Management** page.
