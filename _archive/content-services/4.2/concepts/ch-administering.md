# Administering

This section provides guidance on configuring, maintaining, and administering an Alfresco production environment.

-   **[System paths](../reuse/conv-syspaths.md)**  
When using the Alfresco documentation, there are a number of conventions for common system paths.
-   **[Starting and stopping Alfresco](../concepts/start-stop-intro.md)**  
This section describes how to run the Alfresco server, Share, Explorer, virtualization server, and standalone deployment engine.
-   **[Admin Console Quick Guide](../concepts/at-adminconsole.md)**  
The Admin Console is an Enterprise only application that gives you control over the management and settings of the Alfresco environment.
-   **[Using the Alfresco Admin Tools](../concepts/admintools.md)**  
Alfresco Admin Tools let you manage your administration operations.
-   **[Configuring Alfresco](../concepts/ch-configuration.md)**  
This section describes how to configure and administer Alfresco.
-   **[Managing transformations](../concepts/managing-transformations.md)**  
When you are working with transformations, it is important to understand how file types map to one another and the transformation formats that each file type supports.
-   **[Setting up Alfresco authentication and security](../concepts/auth-intro.md)**  
The first time you access a vanilla Alfresco installation through Alfresco Explorer, Alfresco identifies you as a ‘guest’ user. You can identify yourself as another user by clicking the Login link and entering a new user name and password in the Login window. If you log in with the credentials of a user with administrator privileges \(Alfresco uses admin as the default user name and password\), you can use the Administration Console to create additional users and assign them passwords.
-   **[Setting up clustering](../concepts/ha-intro.md)**  
This section describes how to implement multiple Alfresco instances in a clustered environment.
-   **[Configuring search](../concepts/solr-home.md)**  
This section provides an overview on the Solr server and describes how to configure it.
-   **[Setting up Enterprise to Cloud Sync](../concepts/cloud-sync-intro.md)**  
The Enterprise to Cloud Sync feature is available in Alfresco. This section describes how to configure Enterprise to Cloud Sync and includes solutions for troubleshooting issues.
-   **[Creating and managing workflows](../topics/wf-howto.md)**  
 Alfresco comes with a set of predefined workflow definitions which can be used right out of the box. For more complex requirements, you can also create, deploy, and manage your own Activiti workflows.
-   **[Backing up and restoring](../concepts/ch-backup-restore.md)**  
This section describes the process for backing up the Alfresco content repository only. It assumes that components other than the data residing in Alfresco \(operating system, database, JDK, application server, Alfresco binaries, and configuration, etc.\) are being backed up independently.
-   **[Using the Bulk Import tool](../concepts/Bulk-Import-Tool.md)**  
 The Bulk Import tool provides a mechanism for bulk importing existing content into a repository from the Alfresco server's filesystem.  
-   **[Managing content stores](../concepts/manage-cs-home.md)**  
A content store provides low-level access to stored binaries ensuring that, for every write, a new binary storage location is made available. This section gives an overview on the content stores, their types, and configuration details with examples.
-   **[Configuring templated nodes and space templates](../concepts/templated-nodes-intro.md)**  
With templated nodes and space templates you can store content and folder templates in Alfresco repositories that users can then use to create content.
-   **[Migrating](../concepts/migrating.md)**  
This section describes how to perform various migration procedures for Alfresco servers and databases.
-   **[Setting up Alfresco multi-tenancy](../concepts/mt-intro.md)**  
Alfresco supports a single-instance, single-tenant \(ST\) environment where each tenant \(for example, customer, company, or organization\) runs a single instance that is installed on one server or across a cluster of servers.
-   **[Setting up replication jobs](../concepts/admintools-replication-config.md)**  
The replication service provides control for replicating content between different Alfresco repositories.
-   **[Configuring the File System Transfer Receiver](../concepts/FSTR-intro.md)**  
The File System Transfer Receiver transfers folders and content from an Alfresco core repository \(the DM\) to configured targets using the Transfer Service, for example, a remote file system.
-   **[Monitoring Alfresco](../concepts/monitoring-intro.md)**  
This section describes the various methods for monitoring Alfresco.
-   **[Auditing Alfresco](../concepts/audit-intro.md)**  
Alfresco provides the ability to audit activity. This section describes how Alfresco generates, stores, and retrieves auditing information.
-   **[Administering Explorer from the Administration Console](../topics/guh-hdg-administration.md)**  
The Administration Console enables Alfresco administrators to create and manage users and groups, manage categories, import and export spaces and content, and perform other administrative tasks from within Alfresco Explorer.
