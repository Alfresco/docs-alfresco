# Managing your comments

Adding comments to content is a convenient way of giving feedback. You can edit and delete any comments that you added.

You can't add comments if your permission level on the site is set to Consumer. Speak to your Alfresco administrator if you need to change your permission level.

Only site managers can edit and delete another user's comments.
