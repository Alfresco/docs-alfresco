# Content services

Content services provide advanced content management capabilities.

These services comprise the following:

-   **Lifecycle**: manage content over time
-   **Transformation**: convert content from one type to another
-   **Metadata extraction**: synchronize document metadata with node metadata
-   **Tagging**: arbitrary user-generated tags versus formally defined classifications

-   **[Rules and actions](../concepts/serv-rules-about.md)**  
Rules and actions automatically trigger behavior when certain defined conditions are met. You can extend a standard set of conditions and actions using scripts and custom actions.
-   **[Transformation service](../concepts/serv-transform-about.md)**  
The Transformation service lets you convert content between different file formats, such as generating PDF files from Microsoft Office formats and converting between image formats. This service is extensible to allow the use of additional transformers.
-   **[Metadata extraction](../concepts/metadata-extraction-about.md)**  
Metadata extraction automatically extracts metadata information from inbound and/or updated content and updates the corresponding nodes properties with the metadata values.
-   **[Thumbnailing service](../concepts/serv-thumbnail-about.md)**  
The Thumbnailing service creates a thumbnail of a given content property for a node. It can generate a number of different standard types of thumbnails, including Flash web previews and image thumbnails \(small and medium sized\).
