# Events

Events model something that happens during the lifetime of a process. In a diagram, Events are always visualized as a circle.

There are several types of events defined by BPMN 2.0, of which two always exist in a definition:

-   **startEvent**

    Indicates where a process starts. A start event is triggered by the arrival of a message or similar trigger such as the expiration of a timer.

-   **endEvent**

    An end event models the end process or subprocess. When process execution arrives in an end event, a result is thrown.
