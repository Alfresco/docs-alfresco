# My Files

**My Files** is a unique area in Alfresco where you can create and store content, and no other Alfresco users can access it.

So rather than saving content on your laptop or tablet, you can save it in Alfresco and still keep it private until it's ready to be shared.

You can access the **My Files** area from anywhere in Alfresco by clicking **My Files** at the top of the screen.

The functionality available in the **My Files** area is identical to what you find in the Document Library, see [Working with content in a library](library-intro.md) for details.

**Parent topic:**[Working with content outside the library](../concepts/library-external.md)
