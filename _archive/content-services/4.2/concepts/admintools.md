# Using the Alfresco Admin Tools

Alfresco Admin Tools let you manage your administration operations.

Admin Tools enables Alfresco administrators to create and manage users and groups from within Share, set application preferences, manage categories and tags, and browse the system information in the node browser.

**Note:** Some of the tools previously found in Share Admin Tools have been moved to the Repository Administration Console, which is available in Alfresco Enterprise only.

The Admin Tools option is visible on the menu bar only if you are an Administrator user or a user who is a member of the `ALFRESCO_ADMINISTRATORS` group.

-   **[Opening the Alfresco Admin Tools](../tasks/admintools-open.md)**  
You can only see the **Admin Tools** option on the menu bar if you are an administrator user or a user who is a member of the `ALFRESCO_ADMINISTRATORS` group.

Use the Application tool in the **Admin Tools** to set application settings.
