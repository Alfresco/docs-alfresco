# Gateways

A gateway is used to model concurrency in a process. It is used to control the flow of execution, or in BPMN 2.0 terminology, the tokens of execution.

A gateway is capable of consuming or generating tokens. It is graphically visualized as a diamond shape, with an icon inside. The icon describes the type of gateway.

 A parallel gateway, models a fork into multiple paths of execution, or a join of multiple incoming paths of execution.
-   **[Exclusive gateways](../concepts/wf-process-def-gateways-exclusive.md)**
