# Cluster-specific configuration

If you have a distributed environment and want to implement clustering in Alfresco to improve the availability and performance of various services, you should enable clustering. This section describes the cluster-specific configurations for Alfresco.

Note that this is an optional step. For more information about how to set up a clustered environment, see [Setting up clustering](ha-intro.md).
