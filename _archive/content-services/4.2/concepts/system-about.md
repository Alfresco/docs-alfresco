# Alfresco One overview

Alfresco One is an Enterprise Content Management \(ECM\) platform with hybrid, on-premise, cloud, and mobile delivery options. As a hybrid ECM solution, it combines the efficiency, collaboration, and control of an ECM platform with the agility and flexibility of the cloud.Â 

With Alfresco One, document management, collaboration, and process automation can be synced to the cloud, avoiding the risks associated with uncontrolled consumer file sharing and enabling secure collaboration outside of the firewall.

Alfresco is an enterprise content platform that you can use in the cloud or behind your firewall. It helps you store and share the documents that every business depends on.

The Alfresco content platform allows you to manage any type of content: from simple office documents, to scanned images, photographs, and even large video files. The built-in workflow feature allows companies to automate document intensive business processes, saving time and money. The native collaboration features enable secure collaboration, inside or even outside the firewall.
