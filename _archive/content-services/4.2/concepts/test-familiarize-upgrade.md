# Test and familiarize after upgrading Alfresco in a cluster

You have successfully upgraded and configured Alfresco in a distributed/clustered environment. The aim of this section is to make sure that the features and customizations you have added, are operational.

Here are some of the tips to help you test your Alfresco customizations.

**Note:** Alfresco recommends that you create one or two test sites for testing purpose and put all your test data in those sites. After finishing the tests, you can delete the test sites in order to clear your database.

-   Check that various Alfresco components are communicating with each other.
-   For a clustered upgrade, check if one node is down, check if the request is forwarded to the next available node.
