# JMX bean categories reference

This reference section provides detailed information on the individual bean types exported by Alfresco.

The heading for each bean type provides the JMX object naming scheme, where possible. Each section lists the individual properties for the bean type.

-   **[JMX read-only monitoring beans](../concepts/jmx-readonly-beans.md)**  
JMX values \(Managed Bean or MBean attributes\) are exposed in the Alfresco Admin Console and with internal tools \(Alfresco JMX Dump\) or external tools like JConsole. The read-only beans are described here with example values.
-   **[JMX editable management beans](../concepts/jmx-editman-beans.md)**  
JMX values \(Managed Bean or MBean attributes\) are exposed in the Alfresco Admin Console and with internal tools \(Alfresco JMX Dump\) or external tools like JConsole. The editable management beans are described here with example values where attributes are not already explained in the Alfresco Admin Console.
