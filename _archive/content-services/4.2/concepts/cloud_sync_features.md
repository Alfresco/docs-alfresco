# Enterprise to Cloud Sync features

Enterprise to Cloud Sync automatically synchronizes content between on-premise Alfresco and Alfresco in the cloud.

Enterprise to Cloud Sync allows content to be sent to Alfresco in the cloud, and then automatically synchronizes content between on-premise Alfresco repositories and the cloud instance. This ensures that the on-premise system is in sync with any changes. The Enterprise to Cloud Sync capabilities include:

-   Synchronization of individual and multiple files, folders, and folder hierarchies between on-premise and Alfresco in the cloud
-   Content and common metadata is included within synchronized payloads
-   Automatic synchronization
-   Secure exchange of information over HTTPS connection
-   All actions initiated on the on-premise Alfresco instance
-   Choice over what can be synchronized to ensure sensitive content remains on-premise
