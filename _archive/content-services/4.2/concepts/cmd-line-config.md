# Command line configuration

The beans that load the alfresco-global.properties will give preferential treatment to any JVM-set properties.

-   **[Setting properties on the JVM](../tasks/props-set.md)**  
This section describes how to set the JVM properties.
-   **[Mixing global properties and system property settings](../tasks/bean-override.md)**  
You can use a combination of global properties and system properties for certain customizations. For example, if you wish to distribute a system that has a core set of properties overridden but need to customize the last few for each installation.
