# Working with content outside the library

While the Document Library is the focal point for working with content in Alfresco, there are also a few other areas available to you.

Each of these areas can be accessed wherever you are in Alfresco, from the links at the top of the screen.

The **My Files** and **Shared Files** areas are locations with Alfresco, whereas the **Repository** is an overview of everything in Alfresco.

-   **My Files**: This is an area that only you can access. No-one else can see the content here and every user has their own, unique **My Files** area. It's great for saving draft content to, removing the need for trying to remember where you saved it on your laptop, or was it saved to your mobile...
-   **Shared Files**: This area can be accessed by everyone in your organization. It's a great way to quickly share content with other users that's not ready to be uploaded to a site yet.
-   **Repository**: The area lets you view all Alfresco content you have access to - all the sites, all the system files, everything is available here. You can work just as you would in a site Document Library but here you have a higher view of everything that's available. It's also very handy for Alfresco administrators who want to work with system files.

-   **[My Files](../concepts/library-external-myfiles.md)**  
**My Files** is a unique area in Alfresco where you can create and store content, and no other Alfresco users can access it.
-   **[Shared Files](../concepts/library-external-shared.md)**  
**Shared Files** is a unique area in Alfresco where you can create, store and share content, without adding it to a site Document Library.
-   **[Repository](../concepts/repository-intro.md)**  
The **Repository** displays all the Alfresco content that you have access to, including content of all sites that you're a member of.
