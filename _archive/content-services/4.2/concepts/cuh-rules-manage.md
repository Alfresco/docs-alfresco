# Managing content rules

Content rules can be applied directly to a space or they can be inherited from a parent space. You manage the content rules at the space level.

You are able to specify if inherited rules are included or ignored for a space. You can also reapply rules to ensure that new rules apply to existing content in a space.

-   **[Reapplying rules](../tasks/tuh-rules-reapply.md)**  
When you add rules to a space that already contains content, the rules are not applied to the existing content by default. You must reapply the rules to that space to ensure the existing content is included.
-   **[Ignoring inherited rules](../tasks/tuh-rules-inherited-ignore.md)**  
If a space has inherited rules from the space in which it is contained, you can ignore those inherited rules in that sub space.
-   **[Including inherited rules](../tasks/tuh-rules-inherited-include.md)**  
If a space ignores rules from the space in which it is contained, you can change it to include those inherited rules in that sub space.
