# The calendar

The site calendar lets you schedule and track events related to the current site.

Site members can create events that appear on the calendar for all site users to see. These events also display in the Site Calendar dashlet. You can view the calendar by day, week, or month. The Agenda view displays upcoming events.

**Note:** See [Customizing a site](../tasks/site-customize.md) for how to switch the calendar on and off for a site.

-   **[Accessing the calendar](../tasks/calendar-page-access.md)**  
Access the calendar to view upcoming events for the current site.
-   **[Browsing the calendar](../tasks/calendar-page-browse.md)**  
The main view defaults to a calendar displaying the current month. The explorer panel to the left provides another calendar for navigating the months without affecting the main view.
-   **[Viewing an event](../tasks/calendar-event-view.md)**  
The calendar displays only the event name and time, so to view full details you must open the event. Once open you can edit or delete the event.
-   **[Adding an event](../tasks/calendar-event-add.md)**  
Any site member can schedule an event in the site calendar. The event appears in the calendar and the Site Calendar dashlet.
-   **[Editing an event details](../tasks/calendar-event-edit.md)**  
Edit a scheduled event to change any of the details, including the location, date, and time. You can also add and remove tags, and change the library folder associated with the event.
-   **[Changing event date and time](../tasks/calendar-event-edit-datetime.md)**  
You can easily change the day, time, and duration of an event.
-   **[Deleting an event](../tasks/calendar-event-delete.md)**  
When a scheduled event is cancelled you can easily delete it to remove it from the calendar. This also removes it from the Site Calendar dashlet.
