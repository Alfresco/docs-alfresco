# Performing a basic search

Use the search feature in the Alfresco toolbar to quickly perform a basic search for content.

1.  Type your search criteria in the field provided.

    **Note:** Entering ban will search only for the word *ban*; it will not return results for *banana*. To return matches for a partial word, use a wildcard in your search criteria \(example: ban\*\).

2.  Press ENTER.

3.  Click the thumbnail or content name link in the results list to display that content in its appropriate site.
