# Unsync your content from the cloud

When you no longer need your Enterprise content connected to the cloud, you can remove the sync.

1.  Hover over a synced item/folder in the library and click **More** then **Unsync from Cloud**.

    **Tip:** Items and folders synced to the cloud display the ![](../images/ico-synced.png) icon. Contents of a folder that have been synced display the ![](../images/ico-synced-indirect.png) icon.

    You must unsync the content at the same location where you applied the sync. This means that to unsync a content item that was synchronized with its parent folder, you must unsync that parent folder.

    **Tip:** Click ![](../images/ico-synced-indirect.png) so view the location of the parent folder.

    You're prompted to confirm the sync removal and you can either leave a copy of the synchronized content in Alfresco in the cloud or delete it. Select the **Remove from the cloud** option to remove the content from the cloud.

2.  Click **Remove sync**.

    The cloud icon to the left of the content is cleared, indicating the sync has been removed.
