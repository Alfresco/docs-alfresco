# Defining rules for a folder

Use folder rules to manage your library content automatically. There are two ways to define rules: create your own rules or link to rules already created for a different folder.

When you define a rule, it only applies to new content added to the folder. Items that were in the folder before the rule was defined aren't affected by it. You can manually apply the folder rules with the **Run Rules** action.

**Note:** Even if the folder doesn't have its own rules, it could have inherited rules from a parent folder. A message on the Rules page lets you know if this is the case.

-   **[Creating a rule](../tasks/library-folder-rules-define-create.md)**  
You can create rules for a folder, in much the same way that you might apply rules to your emails.
-   **[Rule actions](../references/rule-actions.md)**  
When you're setting up a rule in Alfresco there are lots of default actions available.
-   **[Linking to an existing rule set](../tasks/library-folder-rules-define-link.md)**  
The **Link to Rule Set** option lets you reuse an existing rule set that's already defined for another folder.
-   **[Creating a simple workflow](../tasks/library-folder-rules-simpleworkflow.md)**  
You can set up rules to trigger a simple workflow that's made up of review and approval steps. When an item enters a folder with this type of rule applied, it will have additional actions available.
