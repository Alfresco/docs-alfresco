# Searching for sites

The Site Finder page lets you search for existing sites.

Use this feature to find a particular site or to display a list of all sites. From the results list you can navigate to a site; manage your site membership by joining or leaving sites; and delete a site \(managers only\).

1.  Open the **Sites** menu and click **Site Finder**.

2.  Type a full or partial site name in the search box.

    **Tip:** Leave the search box empty to display all sites you have permission to access.

    The search syntax supports "starts with" queries. Entering the search criteria 123 won't find the site *Project Alpha 123x4*. Preface your criteria with a wildcard, such as \*123, to find a site that contains the characters *123*.

3.  Click **Search**.

    You see a list of sites that match your criteria. This list includes public sites, moderated public sites, sites you created, and private sites that you belong to. To the right of a site, the actions **Join** and **Request to Join** indicate you are not a site member; the action **Leave** indicates you are a site member.
