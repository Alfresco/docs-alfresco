# Publishing a post to an external blog

In addition to publishing a blog post to the site's internal blog you can publish a post to a configured external blog. To publish a draft post externally you must also publish it internally.

1.  In the Blog click find the post you want to publish.

2.  Click **Publish Externally**.

    Optionally, open the post to perform this action.


A message indicates the selected blog post is published. The text \(Published\) appears after the title and a link to the external blog is added to the post summary.

**Parent topic:**[The blog](../concepts/blog-intro.md)
