# Cancelling a shared link

When you donâ€™t want your publicly shared content to be available anymore, you can break the link. Once you make the link invalid, anyone who tries to access it will be unable to reach the public page.

1.  Enter a site library.

2.  Find the content you previously shared.

3.  Click **Shared**.

    The window displaying the item's URL appears.

4.  Click **Unshare**.


**Parent topic:**[Sharing content](../tasks/library-item-share.md)
