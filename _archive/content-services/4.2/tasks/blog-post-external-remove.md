You can remove an externally published post at any time while still leaving it available in the internal site blog.

    **Fastpath:** Select the **Published Externally** filter in the browsing pane to display only the externally published posts.

2.  Click **Remove Externally**.

    Optionally, open the post to perform this action.


A message indicates the post has been removed from the external blog.
