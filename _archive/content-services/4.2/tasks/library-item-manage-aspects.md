# Managing aspects

You can use aspects to add extra functionality, properties, or options to content. Alfresco provides you with a list of default aspects.

For a detailed list of aspects available in Alfresco and what they do, see [About aspects](../concepts/aspect-about.md).

1.  Click on an item in the library to view it in the Document Details page.

2.  In the **Document Actions** list click **Manage Aspects**.

    The Aspects page opens.

3.  In the **Available to Add** list click ![Add icon](../images/ico-add.png) next to the aspects you want to add to item.

    Click ![Delete icon](../images/ico-delete.png) to remove any existing aspects from the **Currently Selected** list.

4.  Click **Apply changes**.

    The selected aspects are applied to the item. Additional properties added to the item are displayed on the Document Details page. You can edit these properties using **Edit Properties** under **Document Actions**.Â
