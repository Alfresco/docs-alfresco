# Managing group membership

To populate a user group, you can add both individual users and existing user groups.

1.  Click **Admin Tools**, and then click **Groups**.

2.  On the Groups page, click **Browse**.

    The leftmost pane shows all the top-level user groups.

3.  Navigate the group structure to locate the user group you want to work with. Click a user group to select it.

4.  Using the icons in the pane directly to the right of where you selected the group, perform the desired action:

    1.  To add a user, click the **Add User** icon. Using the search feature provided, locate the user you want to add to the selected group. Click **Add** to the right of the user.

    2.  To add a group, click the **Add Group** icon. Using the search feature provided, locate the group you want to add to the selected group. Click **Add** to the right of the user.

    The individual user or group is added as a child to the group selected in the panel.
