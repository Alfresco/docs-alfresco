# Performing an advanced search

Use the search feature in the toolbar to access the advanced search form. Use this to search for content by field, mimetype, modifier, or modification date span.

1.  Click ![Advanced Search icon](../images/advanced-search-icon.png) in the search field then click **Advanced Search**.

    The Advanced Search page displays.

2.  Choose a search type:

    -   **Content**: Searches for all types of content
    -   **Folders**: Searches for all folders and containers, such as library folders and data lists
3.  Enter your search criteria.

    To search by modification date, click the calendar icon to select a date from a calendar.

    To search by the user who last modified the content, enter the appropriate user name in the **Modifier** field.

    **Note:** Entering ban will search only for the word *ban*; it will not return results for *banana*. To return matches for a partial word, use a wildcard in your search criteria \(example: ban\*\).

4.  Click **Search**.

5.  Click the thumbnail or content name link in the results list to display that content in its site.

    **Note:** Use the actions in the results list to view content in the browser or download it to your computer.
