# Moving round a site

The default areas available in a site are the **Site Dashboard**, **Document Library**, and the **Site Members** area. If a site has additional site features then you'll also see a **More** menu.

Additional features can be set up by a site manager when they're [customizing a site](site-customize.md).

1.  In a site click **Document Library**, **Site Members**, or **More** and select an option from the **More** menu.

    The site feature you've selected will open - see the links below for further details on each of these.

    **Tip:** You can click **Site Dashboard** at any point to return to the site dashboard.
