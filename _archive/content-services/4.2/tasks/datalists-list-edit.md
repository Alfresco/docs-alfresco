# Editing the list details

Edit an existing list to modify its title and description.

Only a Site Manager, a Site Collaborator, and the user who created the list can edit it.

1.  In the Data lists explorer panel position your cursor over the list you want to edit to display the available actions.

2.  Click the ![Edit](../images/ico-configure.png) Edit icon.

    The Edit List Details dialog box appears displaying the current list details.

3.  Make the desired changes to the title and description.

    CAUTION:

    You're not be prevented from creating lists with duplicate titles. Review the existing lists to ensure your list name is unique.

4.  Click **Save**.
