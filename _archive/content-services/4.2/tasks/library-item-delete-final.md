# Emptying your Trashcan

When you delete content it's moved to your trashcan. By emptying your trashcan you can permanently remove content from Alfresco.

**Important:** Once you empty your trashcan or delete content from it, the content is permanently gone, you can't get it back again.

1.  Open the user menu on the toolbar and clickÂ **My Profile** then the **Trashcan** tab.

    **Tip:** All content that you've deleted is listed here. You can enter a content name in the search field and click **Search** to look for specific content.

2.  Click **Empty** then **OK**.


The content is permanently deleted from Alfresco. You can also permanently delete specific items by clicking **Delete** next to them, or delete multiple items by selecting them and clicking **Selected Items** then **Delete**.
