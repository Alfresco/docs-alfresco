# Viewing an item in a browser

While the preview feature lets you view a content item in Alfresco, you also have the option of viewing the item in your default browser.

1.  Hover over an item in the library.

2.  Click **View in Browser**.

    A new browser window opens displaying the selected content item. For some file types, such as Microsoft Office documents, Alfresco launches the item in its associated program.
