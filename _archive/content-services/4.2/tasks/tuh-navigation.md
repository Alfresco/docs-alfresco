# Navigating spaces

The **Navigator** enables you to easily navigate the spaces in the Alfresco repository.

It appears in the sidebar to the left of the working area and displays the four highest spaces in the repository.

1.  In the **Navigator**, select the space you wish to view: **Company Home**, **My Home**, or **Guest Home**. The sub spaces display in a tree.

    Clicking **My Alfresco** returns you to **My Alfresco Dashboard**.

2.  Navigate the tree structure: click ![Expand](../images/im-expand.png) to expand a space, displaying its sub spaces; click ![Collapse](../images/im-collapse.png) to collapse a space, hiding its subspaces.

3.  Click a space name to display the space in the working area.

    Click ![Refresh](../images/im-refresh.png) **\(Refresh\)** to refresh the tree view.
