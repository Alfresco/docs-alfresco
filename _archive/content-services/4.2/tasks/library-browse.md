# Exploring the library

You can filter which items you see in the library using the explorer panel on the left side of the library. This can help you to locate specific items in the library.

The **Documents** list in the explorer panel provides the following views:

-   **All Documents**

    Displays all items in the library

-   **I'm Editing**

    Displays the items you currently have checked out

-   **Others are Editing**

    Displays the items checked out by other site members

-   **Recently Modified**

    Displays items modified in the past seven days

-   **Recently Added**

    Displays items added to the library in the past seven days

-   **My Favorites**

    Displays the items you have marked as favorites

-   **Synced Content**

    Displays the items that have been synchronized with an Alfresco in the cloud site

-   **Synced with Errors**

    Displays the items that have been synchronized with an Alfresco in the cloud site, but have errors in the synchronization


The **Library** section displays the folder structure in a tree view. The symbol ![](../images/Subfolders.png) indicates a library folder contains subfolders. Click on a folder to expand or collapse it.

The **Categories** tree lets you filter the library contents by category. Click a category to expand the branch; click it again to collapse it.

The **Tags** list displays the tags currently associated with one or more items. The number following the tag tells you how many library items have that tag.

**Tip:** When you filter content using **Tags** view, items have additional **Locate File** and **Locate Folder** actions to show the actual location of content in the library tree.

The breadcrumb path above the item list displays your current position in the tree. Each breadcrumb item is a link so you can easily return to any part of the current navigation path. You can:

-   Click a link to return to the corresponding folder.
-   Click ![Navigate Up](../images/navigate-up-icon.png) to display the contents of the folder one level higher.
-   Click **Options** then **Hide Breadcrumb** / **Show Breadcrumb** to hide/show the breadcrumb path.

For each piece of content \(folders and items\) you view in the**Document Library** you can:

-   Click the name of an item to display the Document Details page for that item.
-   Click the name of a folder to view its contents. You can see your current location in the breadcrumb path.

All items and folders have multiple options that are displayed when you hover over them.
