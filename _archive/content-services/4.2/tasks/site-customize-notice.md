# Configuring the Site Notice dashlet

Configure the Site Notice site dashlet to display a message for the site users.

Only a site manager can configure this dashlet.

1.  Enter a site.

2.  On the Site Notice dashlet, click the **Configure** icon.

    **Note:** If this dashlet has been configured before, it will probably have a title other than **Site Notice**.

    The Configure Site Notice dialog box opens.

3.  In the **Title** field, type the text you want to appear in the dashlet header.

4.  In the **Text** box, edit the current message or type a new one.

    Use the features provided to format the text; insert bulleted and numbered lists; insert links and images; and help with editing.

5.  Click **OK**.
