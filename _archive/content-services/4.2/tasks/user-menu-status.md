# Posting your status

You can add a status update in the user menu to let people know what you're doing or working on.

Your status is included with your name in the Site Members dashlet and on the People Finder page.

1.  Open the user menu on the toolbar.

    The status field displays your last update.

2.  Click **Set Status**.

3.  Enter a message in the *What are you thinking?* box, and click **Post Status**.

    **Tip:** If you're on your dashboard then refresh your browser to see the updated status in the **My Profile** dashlet.
