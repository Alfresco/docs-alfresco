# Tagging content

To make content easier to find you can create and manage tags for items and folders in the document library.

1.  In the library find the content you want to tag.

2.  Hover your cursor over a tag to display the ![Tag icon](../images/ico-configure.png) tag icon, or if the content has no tags hover your cursor over the label **No Tags**.

    **Tip:** In some views this option isn't available or you'll need to click the ![Information icon](../images/ico-information.png) information icon.

3.  Click ![Tag icon](../images/ico-configure.png).

4.  Create and manage the tags:

    -   **Create a new tag:** Type the tag name; it can be one or more words. Press ENTER.

        **Tip:** A list of possible matches may appear as you type. These are tags already used in this site. You can select a tag from this list to add it.

    -   **Edit an existing tag:** Click a tag to enter editing mode. Change the tag name and press ENTER.
    -   **Remove a tag:** Click the **X** to the right of a tag to remove it.
5.  Click **Save**.


When you click on a tag, either next to content in the document library or in the explorer panel, all content with that tag is displayed in the Document Library.

You can also search for content using tags as the search term.
