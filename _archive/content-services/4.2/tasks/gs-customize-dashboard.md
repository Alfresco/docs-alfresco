# Customizing the site dashboard

A site's dashboard displays all information and activities associated with the site. You can customize the site dashboard just the same as you did with your personal dashboard.

1.  Start off by clicking **Remove** on the welcome panel at the top of the site dashboard, then **Yes** to confirm removal, though you can use the panel to get started with if you like.

2.  Next, click ![Customize Dashboard icon](../images/settings-icon.png) then Customize Dashboard.

3.  Leave the current layout as it is and click **Add Dashlets**.

    **Note:** Notice how the dashlets differ to those available for your personal dashboard - the personal dashlets help you to configure what you want to see such as activity on sites that you're a member of, whereas the site dashlets are designed to help with team collaboration.

4.  Drag the **Wiki** dashlet onto Column 1 and click **OK**.


If you want you can resize the dashlets on the site dashboard as required. You're now nearly ready to add content to your site, just one more step first to customize the site even more.

This video shows the steps in the tutorial.
