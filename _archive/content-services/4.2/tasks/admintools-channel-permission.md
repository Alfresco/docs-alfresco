# Changing a channel permission

Permissions can be granted to users and groups for each publishing channel.

Permissions can be set either by

-   Inherited permissions
-   Locally set permissions

When a channel is created, all users are set to the Consumer role by default. This means that no users will have permission to publish content except the administrative user.

1.  Click **Admin Tools**, and then click **Channels Management**.

2.  Locate the channel that you wish to change the permissions.

3.  Click **Permissions**.

    You see the Manage Permissions page for the channel. Permissions are inherited by default. To disable inherited permissions, click **Inherit Permissions**, and then click **Yes**.
