# Setting up Cloud Sync

If you have an Alfresco in the cloud account you can set up Cloud Sync in your user profile.

1.  Open the user menu on the toolbar and click **My Profile**.

2.  Select the **Cloud Sync** page.

    **Note:** If your Alfresco admin hasn't switched on Cloud Sync then this option won't be available.

3.  Click **Sign in to Alfresco in the cloud**.

4.  Enter your Alfresco in the cloud login details \(email address and password\) and click **Connect**.

    **Note:** If you don't have an Alfresco in the cloud account, click **No Account? Sign up for free** on the dialog box.

    Alfresco validates your credentials and connects you to the cloud. You can disconnect at any time. If you change your Alfresco in the cloud password, edit your login details here to make sure you maintain your connection to the cloud.
