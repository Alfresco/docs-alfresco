# Changing the content type

You can change an items content type from its default to a more specific value.

You can only change the content type if your Alfresco administrator has configured content type properties so that you can enhance an item by giving it a type \(for example, changing a standard document to a policy document\)

1.  Click on an item in the library to view it in the Document Details page.

2.  In the **Document Actions** list click **Change Type**.

    The Change Type dialog box appears.

3.  Select the required type.

    **Note:** The **New Type** list is empty until types are defined by an Alfresco administrator.

4.  Click **OK**.

    When you give an item a type property it is shown on both the Document Details page and the Edit Properties page for the item.
