# Multi-selecting content

You can perform a single action on several pieces of content at once. You can select any number of items and folders in the same view.

1.  Select content in the Document Library. You can do this in two ways:

    -   Click the check box of each item and folder you want to select.
    -   Open the **Select** menu and click an option: **Documents**, **Folders**, or **All**.
    In the Select menu, click **None** to clear your selections; click **Invert Selection** to toggle the check boxes to their opposite state.

2.  Open the **Selected Items** menu and click the action you want to perform.
