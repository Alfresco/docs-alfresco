# Specifying your preferences

The **User Profile** feature enables you to set general preferences for your view of the application.

You can customize the following settings:

-   **Start Location**

    Specify the space you would like the application to display when you log in.

-   **Interface Language**

    Specify in which language you would like to view the interface.

-   **Content Language**

    Specify the preferred language for multilingual properties \(metadata\) and translations of documents. By default, the content language is set to **All Languages**, which means that all translations of a document are shown and that the interface language is used for multilingual properties. If a property or document is not available in the preferred content language, Alfresco tries to find an appropriate alternative.

-   **Offline Editing**

    Ensure the option **Automatically download files for offline editing** is selected to initiate the download process automatically when you select the **Edit Offline** action for a content item.


To specify the general preferences:

1.  Click ![User Profile](../images/im-user-options.png) **\(User Profile\)** in the toolbar to display the User Profile and Settings page.

2.  In the General Preferences pane, select the desired settings.

3.  Click **Close**.
