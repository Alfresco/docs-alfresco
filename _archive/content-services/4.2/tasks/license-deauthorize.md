# Deauthorize an authorized user

You can remove authorized users from the authorization list by deauthorizing them.

Users from the `ALFRESCO_ADMINSTRATORS` permissions group cannot be deauthorized without being first removed from this group.

To deuathorize a user, follow the steps below:

1.  Click **Admin Tools**, and then click **Users**.

    You see the **User Search** page.

2.  In the search box, enter the full or partial name of the user.

3.  Click **Search**.

    The result table displays the user name along with its authorization status.

4.  Click the deauthorization icon \(![](../images/deauthorize.png)\) next to the user you want to deauthorize.

    You will be prompted to confirm your action.

5.  In the prompt window, select the checkbox to confirm your action.

6.  Click **Deauthorize**.

    The relevant user's authorization status changes to `Deauthorized`.


To reauthorize a previously deauthorized user, contact [Alfresco Support](https://support.alfresco.com/).
