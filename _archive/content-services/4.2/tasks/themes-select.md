# Selecting themes

Only an Administrator user can select the Share theme. Any change to the theme will affect all users of the Alfresco instance from the next time that they log in or from a browser refresh.

The installation wizards install the default theme and the sample alternative themes. The available themes are installed in the <configRootShare\>/classes/alfresco/site-data/themes directory.

1.  On the toolbar, expand the **More** menu and click **Application** in the Tools list.

    The Options page appears.

2.  Select the required theme from the menu:

    -   **Green Theme**
    -   **Yellow Theme**
    -   **High Contrast Theme**
    -   **Default Theme**
    -   **Google Docs Theme**
3.  Click **Apply**.


The new theme displays in Share. The new theme persists across sessions.
