# Editing content online

When online editing is enabled for an HTML or plain text content item, you can edit the item online. This shortcut enables you to bypass the tasks of downloading the item to your computer and then updating the repository version with the changes.

1.  Navigate to the space containing the content item you want to edit.

2.  Click ![Edit Online](../images/im-editonline.png) **\(Edit Online\)** for the content item of interest.

    **Note:** To prevent other users from overwriting your changes, the item is automatically locked by you.

    The online editor opens displaying the working copy of the selected item.

3.  Make the necessary changes and click **Save**.

    **Note:** At any time, you can click ![Cancel File Editing](../images/im-cancelfileediting.png) **\(Cancel Editing\)** to unlock the item without saving any edits.

    The working copy of the item displays the updated timestamp. You can leave the item locked if you plan to work on it again or you can unlock it so that it is available to other users.

4.  Click ![Done Editing](../images/im-doneediting.png) \(**Done Editing**\) to unlock the document and add the updates to the repository.
