# Viewing an item

You view an item on the Document Details page without having to download it to your computer. All item details and actions are available on this one page.

1.  In the document library click an item name or thumbnail to display the Document Details page.

    The left side of the page displays the preview pane. Above this you see the basic item information: the item location, item name, version number, the user who last modified the item, and the date/time of the modification. An icon to the left of these details indicates the file type.

    **Note:** When the content item does not have a file type extension or the extension is not recognized, a generic icon is displayed.

    The actions **Favorite**, **Like**, and **Comment** let you add the item to your My Favorites list, like the item, or add a comment to it. After you favorite or like an item, you always have the option of undoing the action. Counters tell you how many people have liked the content and the number of comments added.

    The **Share** action generates a short URL that you can use to quickly share the item with anyone.

    The right side of the page displays the details for the selected item, as well as all of the actions you can perform. The information and actions are grouped in sections that you can expand and collapse.

    The comments display beneath the preview. The most recent comment is at the top of the list.

2.  When the content item contains more than one page, you can use the navigation tools to move through the pages.

3.  You can resize the preview as needed using the sizing tools above the preview.

    **Tip:** If you select **Maximize** then press ESC in the maximized view to return to the details page.

4.  Expand and collapse the sections on the right side of the page to view the information that interests you.
