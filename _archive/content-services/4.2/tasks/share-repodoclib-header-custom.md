# Hiding the Share repository link using header customization

If required, it is possible to customize the Share header menu bar, and hide the **Repository** link. This means users will only be able to browse content in document libraries of sites that they own, or are a member of.

This blog post shows how to remove items from the Share header: [Customizing the Share Header \(Part 3\)](https://www.alfresco.com/blogs/developer/2013/09/16/customizing-the-share-header-part-3/). More generally there is a tutorial on customizing the Share header that can be worked through in this documentation: [Customizing Share Header Menu](dev-extensions-share-tutorials-custom-share-header-menu.md).
