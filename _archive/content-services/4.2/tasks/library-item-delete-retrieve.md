# Recovering deleted content

If you need to recover content that you've deleted, then it's easy to get it back from your trashcan.

1.  Open the user menu on the toolbar and clickÂ **My Profile** then the **Trashcan** tab.

    **Tip:** All content that you've deleted is listed here. You can enter a content name in the search field and click **Search** to look for specific content.

2.  Click **Recover** next to an item to recover it.


The selected content is restored to the location that you deleted it from. You can also recover multiple items by selecting them and clicking **Selected Items** then **Recover**.
