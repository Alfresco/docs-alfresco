# Removing published content

You can remove content published to an external website directly from the document library.

1.  In the library click the name or thumbnail of a published item to display the Document Details page.

2.  Find the currently published version in the Publishing History section.

3.  Click the ![Unpublish icon](../images/ico-unpublish.png) unpublish icon next to the content to remove it from its external location.

    A message prompts you to confirm the action.

4.  Click **OK**.

    A message lets you know that the content has been placed in a queue to be unpublished.

    A new event appears in the Publishing History list. Once complete the status displays **Unpublished**. Refresh the page as necessary to update the status.
