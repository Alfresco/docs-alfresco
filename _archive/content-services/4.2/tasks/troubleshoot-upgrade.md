# Troubleshooting an upgrade

This section provides help for diagnosing and resolving any issues that might arise as a result of an upgrade.

1.  Open the alfresco.log file.

2.  Make a copy of the alfresco.log.

3.  In alfresco.log, note the locations of the temporary files containing the SQL statements executed during the upgrade, and make a copy of these temporary files.

4.  Submit the log file and temporary files to Alfresco Support.

    **Note:** By in-place upgrading a copy of the repository, rolling back to the previous version in the event of an upgrade failure is quick and painless. The original installation, configuration, and repository are untouched by this process, so it can simply be restarted. This process also allows for the upgrade to be performed any number of times.
