# Deleting a rule

When a folder has a rule applied that you don't need anymore, you can delete the individual rule.

1.  Hover over a folder with rules applied \(indicated by the ![](../images/rules-icon.png) icon\) and click **More** then **Manage Rules**.

2.  On the left side of the page, click the rule you want to delete.

    If you might want to use the rule again, consider disabling it instead. Edit the rule to do that.

    **Note:** You can't delete linked or inherited rules here; that has to be done in the folder where they were created.

3.  Click **Delete**.

4.  When you're asked to confirm the deletion, click **Delete**.
