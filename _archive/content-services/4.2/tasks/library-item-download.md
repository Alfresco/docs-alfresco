# Downloading content

You can quickly download content from Alfresco so that you have a local copy.

**Important:** When you select a locked item you're actually downloading the last version that was added to the library, which may be out of date. The user who locked it for editing may have a more recent version of it outside the library.

This feature is also available to download multiple selections \(both items and folders\) as a zip file to your computer.

1.  Hover over an item/folder in the library and click **Download** / **Download as Zip**.

    You are prompted to open or save the file. Depending on your browser settings, the file might be saved automatically to a default location on your computer.

2.  Save the file to your computer.

    **Tip:** You can also select multiple items and/or folders and **Download as Zip** from the **Selected Items** menu.
