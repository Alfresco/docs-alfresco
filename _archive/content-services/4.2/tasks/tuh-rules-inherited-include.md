# Including inherited rules

If a space ignores rules from the space in which it is contained, you can change it to include those inherited rules in that sub space.

1.  Navigate to the space whose content rules you want to manage.

    The space header displays the name and details of the space.

2.  In the **More Actions** menu, click **Manage Content Rules**.

3.  In the **More Actions** menu of the Content Rules page, click **Include Inherited Rules**.

4.  Click **Close** to return to the current space.
