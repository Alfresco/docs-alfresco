# Inviting users to a content item for collaboration

To collaborate with others on a specific content item, you must invite them to that content and define the roles they will play. When you do this, you are setting permissions for the content item.

You can invite both individual users and user groups to a content item. By default, users invited to an item are invited as guests.

1.  Navigate to the space containing the content item to which you want to invite users.

    The space header displays the name and details of the selected space.

2.  In the Content Itemspane, click ![View Details](../images/im-viewdetails.png) **\(View Details\)** for the content item of interest.

    The Detailspage appears.

3.  In the **Actions** list, click **Manage Content Users**.

4.  On the Manage Content Users page, click **Invite**.

    The Invite Content Users Wizard opens.

5.  In Step One, Invite Users, select **User** or **Group**. In the search box, type the full or partial name of the user/group you want to invite and click **Search**.

6.  In the **Results** list, click to select the users/groups to invite.

    Use SHIFT to select multiple, consecutive items; use CTRL to select multiple, nonconsecutive items.

7.  In the **Role** list, click a role for the selected user\(s\)/group\(s\).

8.  Click **Add to List**.

    The selected user\(s\)/group\(s\) and their specified role are added to the list of invitees.

9.  Add additional invitees in the same manner, as required.

    To remove a user or group from this list, click ![Remove](../images/im-delete.png) **\(Remove\)**.

10. Click **Next** once all users/groups have been added.

11. In Step Two, Notify Users, choose one of the following options:

    -   Click **No** if you do not want the invited users to be notified of the invitation by email.
    -   Click **Yes** if you want the invited users to be notified of the invitation by email, then complete the **Subject** and **Message** boxes. You can write your own message, or select a template from the **User Template** menu and click **Insert Template**.
12. Click **Next**.

13. In Step Three, Summary, click **Finish**.

    The Manage Content Users page displays the invited users and groups for the content item.

14. Click **Close**to return to the Detailspage.
