# Disabling the auto-versioning feature

This section describes how to disable versioning for all content in the repository.

1.  Open the alfresco-global.properties file.

2.  Add the following property:

    ```
    version.store.enableAutoVersioning=false
    ```

    When this property is set to false, the `VersionableAspect` will not respond to any events;Â even if the aspect is present, it will not create versions.

3.  Save the global properties file.

4.  Restart the Alfresco server.
