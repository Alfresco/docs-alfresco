# Sharing content

You can easily share an item - even with people who don't have an Alfresco account. Clicking the **Share** action generates a URL that you can send by email or publish using social networking websites.

People with access to the URL can view the content. Those with an Alfresco account have the option of logging in; those without an account can create one.

This option is available in the Document Library Detailed view and on the Document details page. In the Document Library graphical views click ![Information icon](../images/ico-information.png) to see the option.

1.  In the **Document Library** find the content you want to share.

    You can only share content items, not folders.

2.  Click ![Share icon](../images/ico-share.png) **Share**.

    A window appears displaying the URL for this item.

    **Tip:** The **View** action lets you preview the item to ensure it is the content you want to share.

3.  Click the icon that represents how you want to share the link.

    **Note:** You can also copy the link and paste it wherever you like, such as an email or document.

    When you select a sharing option, a page relevant to your selection displays.

4.  Complete the details on the page provided and share the link.

    -   Email: The email subject and body are prepopulated for you. Add a recipient and edit the message as necessary, then send.
    -   Facebook: Write a comment to post with the link and select how you want to share it. Click **Share Link**.
    -   Twitter: Edit the message as necessary and click **Tweet**.
    -   Google+: Write a comment to post with the link and specify who you want to share it with. Click **Share**.

-   **[Cancelling a shared link](../tasks/library-item-unshare.md)**  
 When you donâ€™t want your publicly shared content to be available anymore, you can break the link. Once you make the link invalid, anyone who tries to access it will be unable to reach the public page.
