There are two RSS feed dashlets that you can include on your personal and site dashboards: RSS Feed and Alfresco Add-ons RSS Feed. On both dashlets you can edit the default URL to display any RSS feed.

1.  Click the **Configure** icon on the dashlet title.

2.  Specify the feed you want to subscribe to.

3.  Select the number of feed items you want to display.

4.  Select **Open links in new window** to have the target story display in a new window.

5.  Click **OK**.
