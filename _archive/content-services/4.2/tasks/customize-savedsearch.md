# Configuring the Saved Search dashlet

Configure the Saved Search dashlet to run a specific search each time the dashboard is loaded.

On the site dashlet, only a site manager can configure the Saved Search dashlet.

1.  Navigate to your personal dashboard or enter a site.

2.  On the Saved Search dashlet, click the ![Configure](../images/ico-configure.png) configure icon.

    The Enter Search Term dialog box opens.

3.  Type the search criteria.

    **Note:** Entering ban will search only for the word *ban*; it will not return results for *banana*. To return matches for a partial word, use a wildcard in your search criteria \(example: ban\*\).

4.  Enter a title for the dashlet that represents the results that will be returned.

5.  Select the number of results you want to display.

6.  Click **OK**.
