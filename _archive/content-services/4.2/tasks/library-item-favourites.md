# Favoriting content

Use the **Favorite** action to mark library content that you access often. This adds the item or folder to the My Favorites view in the explorer panel where you can easily find it.

You can favorite both library items and folders.

**Tip:** In some views this option isn't available or you'll need to click the ![Information icon](../images/ico-information.png) information icon.

1.  In the library find the content you want to favorite.

2.  Click ![Favorite icon](../images/favorite-icon.png) **Favorite**.

    You'll see the icon change.

    **Note:** Click the **Favorite** icon again if you want to remove the content from your list of favorites.
