# Translating an asset within a translated section

Once you have prepared the website section that you want to translate, you can begin creating translations for the existing website assets.

This task assumes you are in the Document Library page component of the Quick Start site, the **Show Folders** feature is enabled, and you created a translation for a section in the Government sample site.

1.  Navigate to **Alfresco Quick Start \> Quick Start Editorial \> root \> en**.

2.  Locate the asset that you want to translate and click **Manage Translations** in the associated action list.

    At the top of the Manage Translations page you see the link **Mark this document as the English translation**. Alfresco recognizes that this asset is inside the section marked as English and conveniently puts this action in a prominent location.

3.  Click **Mark this document as the English translation**.

4.  In the Action column click **Create** to the right of the language for which you have already created a translation section.

    The Create Content page appears.

5.  Complete the form by entering a translation of the original text in the **Content** text editor.

    It is not necessary to change the name of the item as this asset will be placed in a different folder.

6.  Click **Create**.

    This creates a new asset and displays its details page. The breadcrumb path shows the location of the new asset in its appropriate language section. Alfresco recognizes that this is a translation and automatically creates the correct website structure for you as you create the translated assets.

    As an example, if you create a translation of the asset **root \> en \> news \> family-home-community \> article3.html** into German \(section **de**\), Alfresco places the new asset in **root \> de \> news \> family-home-community \> article3.html**.

    You can rename the folders at any time. New translations will continue to be filed appropriately.
