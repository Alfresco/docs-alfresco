# Adding folder paths to the Windows path variable

You may need to add folder paths to the Windows path variable when installing on a Windows-based system.

1.  On the Windows desktop, right-click **My Computer**.

2.  In the pop-up menu, click **Properties**.

3.  In the System Properties window, click the **Advanced** tab, and then click **Environment Variables**.

4.  In the System Variables window, highlight **Path**, and click **Edit**.

5.  In the Edit System Variables window, insert the cursor at the end of the **Variable** value field.

6.  If the last character is not a semi-colon \(;\), add one.

7.  After the final semi-colon, type the full path to the file you want to find.

    For example: path C:\\jdk

8.  Click **OK** in each open window.

    The new path will be used the next time a command prompt is opened, or a service is started.
