# Linking your site to the cloud

You can create a link from your Alfresco One site to your cloud account to enable cloud-sync.

**Note:** Your Alfresco administrator must have switched on the Cloud Sync feature.

**To link your site to the cloud:**

1.  Open the user menu on the toolbar and click **My Profile**.

2.  Click **Cloud Sync** and then **Sign in to Alfresco in the Cloud**.

3.  Enter the email and password you use to sign in to your cloud account, then click **Connect**.

    **Tip:** If you have not set up a cloud account then click the **No Account? Sign up for free** option.

    Thatâ€™s it. You are now ready to share your content with your external consultants.


This video shows the steps in the tutorial.
