# Removing users from a space

Remove a user or group from a space when you no longer want them to have access to the content within that space.

1.  Navigate to the space whose users you want to manage.

    The space header displays the name and details of the selected space.

2.  In the **More Actions** menu, click **Manage Space Users**.

3.  On the Manage Space Users page, click ![Remove](../images/im-user-delete.png) **\(Remove\)** for the user or group you want to remove.

    In this list, the icon ![User](../images/im-user.png) to the left of the name indicates a user; the icon ![Group](../images/im-group.png) indicates a group.

4.  On the Remove Userpage, click **Yes** to confirm the action.

5.  Click **Close** to return to the current space.
