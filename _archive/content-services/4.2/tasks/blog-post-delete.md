# Deleting a blog post

Delete a blog post to permanently remove it from the current site's blog.

Deleting a post also deletes all of its comments. It does not, though, remove the post from the external blog if it has been published to one. Only a Site Manager and the user who created the blog post can delete it.

1.  In the Blog post list find the blog post you want to delete.

2.  Click **Delete**.

    **Note:** You can viewing the post first to ensure it is the one you want to delete, then select **Delete** on the post view page.

    A message prompts you to confirm the deletion.

3.  Click **Delete**.


A message indicates the selected blog post has been deleted.
