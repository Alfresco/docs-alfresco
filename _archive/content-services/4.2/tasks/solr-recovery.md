# Restoring Solr Indexes

This section describes the process for restoring theÂ Solr indexes.

During the recovery process, Solr queries Alfresco to update the indexes restored from a backup. To restore Solr indexes, use the following steps:

1.  Stop the Solr server.

2.  Copy a backup index to the data directory \($\{data.dir.root\}/$\{data.dir.store\}\) for each core.

    Remember to use a backup created from the same Alfresco instance.

3.  Restart the Solr server. Solr will start to track the indexes based on the state of the restored index.
