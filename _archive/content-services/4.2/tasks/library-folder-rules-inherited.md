# Switching off inherited rules

If a folder is inheriting rules from a parent folder, you can easily switch them on and off as needed.

Switching inherited rules on and off works at an individual folder level, and will not affect any other folders.

1.  Hover over a folder with rules applied \(indicated by the ![](../images/rules-icon.png) icon\) and then **Manage Rules**.

    If a folder has inherited rules these are displayed on the left side of the page.

2.  Click **Inherit Rules**.

    Any inherited rules are switched off for the folder and **Don't Inherit Rules** is shown. You can click **Don't Inherit Rules** to switch inherited rules back on for the folder.
