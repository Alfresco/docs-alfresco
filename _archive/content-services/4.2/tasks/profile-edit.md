# Updating your profile

Alfresco user profiles help you to identify a user's roles and responsibilities, or even find out who's who in your organization by checking profile pictures.

When you click on your name at the top of the screen a menu opens where you can update profile details, change your password, search the help, and logout.

1.  Click your user name and select **My Profile**, then **Edit Profile**.

    **Note:** You can also select **View My Profile** from the **My Profile** dashlet.

2.  Enter all the details that you want to show in your profile, including a picture if you like, then click **Save Changes**.

    **Note:** If you already had a profile photo, uploading a new one overwrites it.

    If you enter a Google Username it will be used as the default account when you edit or create Google Docs.

3.  Click **Home** and you can see the updated details in the **My Profile** dashlet.

4.  And lastly you can add real-time customization by clicking the user menu on the toolbar and clicking **Set Status**.

5.  Enter a message in the *What are you thinking?* box, and click **Post Status**.

    **Tip:** If you're on your dashboard then refresh your browser to see the updated status in the **My Profile** dashlet.


When your colleagues view your profile they'll see all the details you've entered and know exactly what you're working on.
