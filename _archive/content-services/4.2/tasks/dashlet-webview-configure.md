# Configuring the Web View dashlet

Configure the Web View dashlet to display websites.

**Note:** Some websites have restrictions that stop you from displaying them.

The dashboard must be customized to display the Web View dashlet.

1.  On the Web View dashlet, click the **Configure** icon.

2.  In the **Link Title** field, type the text you want to appear in the dashlet header.

    If you don't specify a title the dashlet header displays the URL of the website you specify.

3.  In the **URL** field, type the website address.

    **Important:** Ensure the URL entered does not contain the JavaScript code `if(self.parent.frames.length!=0)self.parent.location=document.location;`. This or similar code causes the referenced website to open directly in the browser rather than in the Web View dashlet. This will lead to problems viewing the current dashboard \(personal or site\).

4.  Click **OK**.
