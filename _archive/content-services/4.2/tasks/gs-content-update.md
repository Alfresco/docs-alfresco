# Editing content

Updating your content in Alfresco is easy to do and you can even select whether to edit online, offline, or in Google Docs.

1.  In the Document Library item list, hover your cursor over one of the document.

    This highlights the item and displays the actions available for that item.

2.  Click **More** and then select **Edit Offline**.

    Alfresco now shows a notification that the document is locked. Depending on your browser the content will be either downloaded automatically, or you will need to choose a location to save it to.

    The document is saved to this location with **\(Working Copy\)** added to the title.

3.  Now open the document from this location using you're preferred software and make an edit it to it.

4.  When you've done that save and close it.

5.  Back in Alfresco, hover your curser over the document and click **Upload New Version**.

8.  When the upload is finished click **OK**, and a modification update is shown on-screen.
