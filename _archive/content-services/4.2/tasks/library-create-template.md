# Creating content from a template

As well as creating content from scratch, you can also create content from templates.

**Note:** Templates are only available if your Alfresco administrator has [set some up for you](../concepts/templated-nodes-intro.md).

1.  Select the folder in the document library where you want to add the content.

    The item list displays the current contents of the selected folder. The content you create will be added here.

2.  Click **Create** then **Create document from template**.

    A list of available templates will be displayed.

3.  Select the template.

    A new document based on the template is added to the document library.
