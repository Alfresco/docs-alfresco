# Deleting a user account

Delete a user account to remove the user from the system.

**Note:** Deleting a user removes their permissions from the repository. If you create a user with the same `userid` as a previously deleted user, the new user gets access to the original user's files but not their permissions as they are removed upon user deletion.

1.  Click **Admin Tools**, and then click **Users**.

    You see the User Search page.

2.  Search for a user, and then select the user.

3.  On the User Profile page, click **Delete User**.

    A message prompts you to confirm that you want to delete the user account.

4.  Click **Delete**.
