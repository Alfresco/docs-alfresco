# Installing Tomcat application server

This section describes how to install an instance of Tomcat 7 manually and modify it to use the correct directory structure and files for Alfresco.

These instructions recommend that you name the required directories as shared/classes and shared/lib because these are the path names used within full Alfresco installations. You can substitute alternative names for these directories. The installation directory for Tomcat is represented as <TOMCAT\_HOME\>.

1.  Download and install Tomcat version 7 following the instructions from [http://tomcat.apache.org](http://tomcat.apache.org).

2.  Create the directories required for an Alfresco installation:

    1.  Create the shared/classes directory.

    2.  Create the shared/lib directory.

3.  Open the <TOMCAT\_HOME\>/conf/catalina.properties file.

4.  Change the value of the `shared.loader=` property to the following:

    `shared.loader=${catalina.base}/shared/classes,${catalina.base}/shared/lib/*.jar`

    **Note:** If you have used alternative names for the directories, you must specify these names in the `shared.loader` property.

5.  Copy the JDBC drivers for the database you are using to the lib/ directory.

6.  Edit the <TOMCAT\_HOME\>/conf/server.xml file.

7.  Set attributes of HTTP connectors.

    Tomcat uses ISO-8859-1 character encoding when decoding URLs that are received from a browser. This may cause problems when creating, uploading, and renaming files with international characters.

    By default, Tomcat uses an 8K header buffer size, which may not be large enough for Kerberos and NTLM authentication protocols.

    Locate the `Connector` sections, and then add the `URIEncoding="UTF-8"` and `maxHttpHeaderSize="32768"` properties.

    ```
    <Connector port="8080" protocol="HTTP/1.1" URIEncoding="UTF-8" connectionTimeout="20000" redirectPort="8443" maxHttpHeaderSize="32768"/> 
    ```

8.  Save the server.xml file.


When using Internet Explorer versions 7 and 8, if you try to download a document from Alfresco Share running in Tomcat with https \(SSL\) enabled, you may see an error message.Â To resolve this issue, add the following line to the `context` element in the <TOMCAT\_HOME\>/conf/context.xml file:

```
<Valve className="org.apache.catalina.authenticator.SSLAuthenticator" securePagesWithPragma="false" />
```
