# Renaming content

You can quickly rename library items and folders.

1.  In the library find the content you want to rename.

2.  Hover your cursor over the content name to display the ![Configure icon](../images/ico-configure.png) edit icon.

    **Tip:** In some views you'll need to click the ![Information icon](../images/ico-information.png) information icon.

3.  Click this icon to enter editing mode.

4.  Change the name and click **Save** \(or press ENTER\).

    **Important:** Don't change or delete the filename extension.

    The updated name is shown in the item list.

    **Note:** You can also rename an item or folder by editing its properties.
