# Managing tasks

Tasks assigned to you appear in two places: the My Tasks personal dashlet and the My Tasks page. Each task stays assigned to you until you complete or reassign it.

1.  Click **Tasks** then **My Tasks**.

2.  Hover over a task and click **Edit Task**.

    The Edit Task page appears displaying the task details. The actions available on this page depend on the task type.

    **Tip:** You can also access this page from the My Tasks dashlet: click the **Edit Task** icon.

3.  Manage the selected task in one or more of the following ways:

    -   **Update**: If the task is in progress but not yet complete, you can change the task status and add a comment indicating your progress. Remember to click **Save and Close**. The task stays assigned to you.
    -   **Reassign**: Click **Reassign** and use the search field provided to find a user. Click **Select** to the right of a user to reassign the task to that person.
    -   **Approve or Reject**: When you're done with a task you can update the task status, add a comment indicating the work done, and then click either **Approve** or **Reject**. The task returns to the user who started the workflow and no longer appears in your task list.
    -   **Claim**: Click **Claim** to take responsibility for a pooled task. This action is available only for pooled tasks that are unassigned.
    -   **Release to Pool**: Click **Release to Pool** to place a task back in the pool. The task will appear in the task list as *Unassigned* and can be claimed by another user. This action is available only for pooled tasks that are currently owned by you.
    -   **Add**: Click **Add** beneath the Items list to locate and select content items to add to the task. This action is available only for Adhoc tasks.
    -   **Task Done**: When you complete a task it returns to the user who started the associated workflow. Click **Task Done** to finish a task. This removes it from your task list.
    When the selected action is complete you are redirected to an appropriate page.
