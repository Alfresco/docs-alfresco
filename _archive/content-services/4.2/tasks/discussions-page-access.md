# Accessing the discussion forum

Access the discussion forum to view the discussion topics for the current site.

Within a discussion you can create new topics, as well as edit and delete topics you created. You can also take part in a discussion by replying to a topic.

1.  In a site click **More** then **Discussions**.

    **Note:** In each site the feature names can be customized. If the site manager has done this, the link may have a name other than **Discussions**.

    This opens the discussion forum. The main page defaults to the **New** view so you see a list of the topics created in the past seven days. The summary includes:

    -   the topic title
    -   the date and time the topic was created
    -   the user who created the topic
    -   the number of replies to the topic
    -   a sample of the content
    -   the tags associated with the topic
2.  Use the **<<** and **\>\>** navigation buttons to move forward and backward through multiple pages of topics.

3.  Click **Simple View** to display only the basic topic information: title, creation date/time, and author.

    Click **Detailed View** to display the summary view.
