# Editing content offline

The Edit Offline feature enables you to download an item from the repository to your computer to edit it with the appropriate desktop application. This process automatically locks the repository version of the content item to prevent editing conflicts.

The process for editing a content item offline will vary depending on your User Profile setup.

1.  Navigate to the space containing the content item you want to edit.

2.  Click ![Edit Offline](../images/im-edit.png) **\(Edit Offline\)** for the content item of interest.

    If your preferences indicate automatic download, the file begins to download automatically and you are prompted to specify a file destination. When the automatic download feature is not enabled, the selected item is simply locked in the current space and you can use the **Download** feature at your convenience to place a copy of the item on your computer.

3.  At the prompt \(when automatic download is enabled\), save the item to the desired location on your computer.

4.  Click **Close** on the Download page.

    The **Content Items** pane displays both the original item \(locked\) and a working copy of the item.

5.  On your computer, open the file with the relevant desktop application and make the necessary changes.

    **Note:** At any time, you can click ![Cancel File Editing](../images/im-cancelfileediting.png) **\(Cancel Editing\)** to release the lock on the item without saving any edits.

    Once your offline edits are complete, you must update the version in the repository to allow others to see the changes.
