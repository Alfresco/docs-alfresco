# Copying content

You can copy content between Alfresco locations, within a site or across different sites.

1.  In a site library find the item or folder you want to copy.

    When you copy a folder, you also copy its contents.

2.  Hover over an item/folder and click **Copy to**.

    **Tip:** In some views you'll need to click the ![Information icon](../images/ico-information.png) information icon.

    **Note:** You're copying only the current version. The version history and comments are not carried over with the content.

3.  Choose the site and folder where you want to place a copy of the content.

    **Note:** You can only copy content to sites that you have permission to access.

4.  Click **Copy**.

    A copy of the content is created. This is considered a new item so appears as version 1.0, with you as the creator.


You can move multiple items at once by selecting them and using the **Move to** option on the **Selected Items** menu.
