# Running a replication job

The **Run Job** tool allows you to run a replication job. You can do this at any time. If a schedule is set for the job, it remains in place and will be run at the appropriate time.

1.  Click **Admin Tools**, and then click **Replication Jobs**.

2.  In the Jobs section, click the job that you want to run.

    The job appears highlighted in the list and its details appear on the right side of the page.

    **Note:** For a job to be run, it must be enabled.

3.  Click **Run Job**.

    The Status section on the right side of the page indicates that the job is running. The date and time the job started is displayed.
