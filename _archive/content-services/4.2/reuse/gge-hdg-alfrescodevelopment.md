This section provides some guidelines and examples for developing against Alfresco repositories.

-   **[Alfresco repository extension points](../concepts/customize-overview.md)**

-   **[Customizing content transformations](../tasks/contenttrans-customize.md)**  
This task describes how to customize content transformations.
