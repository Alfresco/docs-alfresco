# User roles and permissions

A user's role determines what they can and cannot do in a site. Each role has a default set of permissions.

The following sections describe these permissions. In general:

-   Managers have full rights to all site content - what they have created themselves and  what other site members have created.
-   Collaborators have full rights to the site content that they own; they have rights to  edit but not delete content created by other site members.
-   Contributors have full rights to the site content that they own; they cannot edit or  delete content created by other site members.
-   Consumers have view-only rights in a site: they cannot create their own content.

**Note:** As well as these four default roles you might also see additional roles in different places in Alfresco.

-   Coordinator - has full rights to all content - what they have created themselves and what others have created.
-   Editor - has rights to edit file properties and check files in and out; they cannot create their own content.

Your Alfresco Administrator can also add additional roles.

Site content can be defined as any content created or added to a site. This includes, but is not limited to, wiki pages, blog postings, library folders and items, calendar events, discussion topics, and comments on any content.
