# Moving content

Move content to relocate it to another location within the current site. You can also move content to a different site or to Alfresco Explorer.

This task assumes you are in the library of the desired site. To move a folder and its contents the **Show Folders** feature must be enabled.

This feature is also available for multiple selections being moved to a common destination. You can move the content only to sites that you have permission to access.

1.  Navigate the libraryâ€™s folder structure to locate the content you want to move.

2.  Position the cursor over the folder or item of interest in the item list to display the available actions.

3.  Click **More** and then **Move to**.

    The Move \[name\] to page appears.

4.  Select the Destination:

    -   Click **Sites** to move the selected content to another site.
    -   Click **Repository** to move the selected content to a space in Alfresco Explorer.
    -   Click **My User Home** to move the selected content to your User Home space in Explorer.
5.  Specify the path, as follows, depending on whether you are moving to a site or to the Explorer repository:

    -   When moving to a site, click the desired site in the **Site** list. For the **Path**, navigate the folder structure and click the destination folder.
    -   When moving to a repository or your User Home space, navigate the repository structure and click the destination space.
6.  Click **Move**.


The dialog box closes and the content is moved from its original location to the specified location.
