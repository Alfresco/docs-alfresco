# Unsync your content from the cloud

When you no longer need your Enterprise content connected to the cloud, you can break the connection.

This task assumes you are in the library of the desired site. To unsync a folder and its contents the **Show Folders** feature must be enabled.

1.  Locate the folder or content item you want to unsync from Alfresco in the cloud.

    You must unsync the content at the same location where you applied the sync. This means that to unsync a content item that was synchronized with its parent folder, you must unsync that parent folder.

    **Tip:** Having trouble locating the folder where the synchronization was first applied? Click the cloud icon to the left of the item you want to unsync to open the Sync Info box. The Synced Folder section gives you a link to the source folder.

2.  Position the cursor over the folder or item of interest in the item list to display the available actions.

3.  Click **More** and then **Unsync from Cloud**.

    You are prompted to confirm the action. You have the option of leaving the synchronized content in Alfresco in the cloud or deleting it. Select the check box if you want to remove the content from the cloud.

4.  Click **Remove sync**.

    The cloud icon to the left of the content is cleared, indicating the connection has been broken.
