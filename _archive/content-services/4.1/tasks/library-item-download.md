# Downloading content to your computer

You can download any content item from the library to your computer. You can access the item from the tree structure or any of the available browsing views.

This task assumes you are in the library of the desired site.

When you select a locked item to download, you are actually downloading the last version checked into the library. It is important to realize that this version may be out of date. As the item is being edited by another site member, a more recent version may exist outside the library.

1.  Navigate the libraryâ€™s folder structure to locate the item you want to download.

2.  Position the cursor over the item of interest in the item list to display the available actions.

3.  Click **Download**.

    You are prompted to open or save the file.

4.  Choose to save the file to your computer.

    Depending on your browser, you are prompted to specify a destination or the item is downloaded to a default location.

5.  Once the download is complete you can close the dialog box.


A copy of the selected file now exists on your computer.
