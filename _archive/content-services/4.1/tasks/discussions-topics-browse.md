# Browsing the discussion topics

The browsing feature in the discussions forum lets you filter the discussion topics so you can more easily navigate the content.

This task assumes you are in the discussions forum of the desired site.

The browsing pane on the left side of the page lets you display a subset of the discussion topics by selecting a specific view or a tag.

The **Topics** list in the browsing pane provides the following views:

-   **New**

    Displays the topics created or updated in the past seven days

-   **Most Active**

    Displays the topics with the most replies

-   **All**

    Displays all topics

-   **My Topics**

    Displays the topics created by the current user


The **Tags** list displays the tags currently associated with one or more discussion topics. The number following the tag tells you how many discussion topics are associated with the tag.

**To browse the discussion topics:**

1.  Select an option in the browsing pane:

    1.  In the **Topics** list click a view to display the discussion topics in the current site that correspond to that selection.

    2.  In the **Tags** list click the tag you're interested in to display all topics in the current site associated with that tag.

2.  Click **Simple View** to display only the basic topic information: title, creation date/time, and author.

    Click **Detailed View** to display the summary view.
