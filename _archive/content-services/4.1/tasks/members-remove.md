# Removing a site member or site group

At any time a site manager can remove an individual member or a group from a site.

This task assumes you are in the Members component of the desired site.

Once removed the user or group no longer has access to the site. If this is a public site the user can choose to rejoin it.

1.  Beneath the banner select **People** or **Groups** to display the appropriate search page.

2.  Locate the site member or group you want to remove from the current site.

    The page displays the search results.

3.  Click **Remove** to the right of the user or site group you want to remove from the site.
