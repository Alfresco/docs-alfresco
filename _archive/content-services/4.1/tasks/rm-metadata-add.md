# Adding record metadata

Each record has a default set of metadata. You have the option of adding additional metadata fields specific to the record type. You can associate the record with a specific type when you upload it to the File Plan or you can add the metadata after, which this task describes.

1.  Navigate to an undeclared record in the File Plan.

2.  Click **Add Record Metadata** in the actions list.

    The Add Record Metadata dialog box lists the available record types. If you associated a record type when you uploaded the file, that type will not appear in this list.

3.  Click the record type appropriate for the record.

    You can select more than one record type. Select multiple types using the method appropriate for your operating system.

4.  Click **OK**.

    Some record metadata is mandatory. Before you can declare the record, you must edit the metadata to complete the mandatory fields.
