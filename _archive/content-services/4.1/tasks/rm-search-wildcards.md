# Search using wildcards

An example of a simple wildcard query is to match any word starting with 'war' in any record name, title, description, or content.

1.  In the **Query Text** box, enter:

    `keywords:war*`

2.  In the **Results options** section, select the check box for **Records**.


The single and multiple wildcard characters can be combined as needed. For example, "warshi?" and "\*ship" and "\*sh??" all match "warship".
