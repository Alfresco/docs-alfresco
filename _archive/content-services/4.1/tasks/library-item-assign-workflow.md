# Starting a workflow

In the document library you can attach a workflow directly to one or more content items. Starting a workflow generates a workflow task. You then manage the tasks resulting from workflow on the My Tasks dashlet on your personal dashboard.

This task assumes you are in the library of the desired site.

This feature is also available for multiple selections.

1.  Navigate the library’s folder structure to locate the item you want to work with.

2.  Position the cursor over the item of interest in the item list to display the available actions.

3.  Click **More** and then **Start Workflow**.

    **Note:** You can also click **Start Workflow** on the My Tasks personal dashlet, the My Tasks page, or the Workflows I've Started page to begin a workflow that is not associated with a content item.

    The Start Workflow page appears.

4.  Expand the **Workflow** list and select the type of workflow you want to define.

    The following preconfigured workflows are available:

    -   **Adhoc**

        Lets you assign a task to a single user

    -   **Group Review & Approve**

        Lets you set up review and approval of content, assigning the workflow task to a single group

    -   **Parallel Review & Approve**

        Lets you set up review and approval of content, assigning the workflow task to multiple users

    -   **Pooled Review & Approve**

        Lets you set up review and approval of content, assigning the workflow task to multiple users. One user can take ownership of the task at a time, completing it or returning it to the pool to be claimed by another user associated with the task.

    -   **Review & Approve**

        Lets you set up review and approval of content, assigning the workflow task to a single user

    -   **Review & Publish**

        Lets you review and publish web content. This option is specific to the Web Quick Start demo.

    -   **Review & Publish Section Structure**

        Lets you review and publish the structure of a section of the website. This option is specific to the Web Quick Start demo.

    The appropriate workflow form displays where you enter the details of the workflow task being initiated. Required fields are marked with an asterisk \(\*\).

5.  Provide the basic details for the workflow task in the General section.

    1.  In the **Message** field describe what you want the recipient of the task to do, such as Please review the attached content. This text displays in the My Tasks dashlet for the workflow task. This content should clearly explain to the user what they are expected to do with the related content item\(s\).

    2.  Click the icon to the right of the **Due** field to specify the completion date for the task.

    3.  Select a **Priority** setting for the task.

6.  Select the user\(s\) or group you want to be responsible for the task generated by the workflow.

    You assign the task to either a user or a user group depending on the type of workflow selected.

    1.  In the Assignee section click **Select**.

    2.  Type the full or partial name of the desired user or group.

        You must enter a minimum of one \(1\) character. The search is not case sensitive.

    3.  Click **Search**.

    4.  Click **Select \>\>** to the right of a user or group to select it.

        **Note:** You can select multiple users for the **Parallel Review & Approve** workflow. In this case the button is **Add \>\>**.

    5.  Click **OK**.

    6.  For tasks with groups and multiple users you must complete the **Required Approval Percentage** field. Indicate the percentage of reviewers that must approve the task in order for the entire workflow task to be considered complete.

7.  Associate the task with one or more items. You can add and remove items from the workflow.

    You can select any content — library items, wiki pages, blog postings, calendar events, site-related web links, discussion topics, and data list items — from any site you have permission to access.

    **Note:** When you start the workflow from a content item then the workflow is already associated with that item. You can add additional items to this list.

    1.  Click **Add** beneath the Items list to associate additional items with the workflow.

        On the **Select** dialog box you choose a site and then navigate the list on the left side to locate the items you want to add.

        The button at the top of the list indicates your current location. Click this button to display the full path; click an entry to return to that point in the path. Click the up arrow to return to the previous level in the hierarchy.

        Click the **Add** icon to the right of an item to add it to the list on the right. Click **OK** when you are done.

    2.  Click **View More Actions** to the right of an item in this list to display the details page for the content item.

        **Important:** Navigating to the details page with this action cancels the workflow you started. You will need to start the workflow from scratch.

    3.  Click **Remove** to the right of an item in this list to delete it from the workflow task.

    4.  Click **Remove All** beneath the list to delete all items from the workflow task.

8.  Enable the **Send Email Notifications** setting in the Other Options section to have the application automatically send an email each time a task is assigned to a user as part of this workflow.

    Tasks generated by the workflow will still appear in the user's My Tasks dashlet. The email is sent to the email address listed in the user's profile. If an address is not provided, no email will be sent.

    **Note:** For group and pooled tasks, every member of the selected group will receive the email notification.

9.  Click **Start Workflow**.

    The workflow task is created. In the content item list an icon to the left of the items selected indicates that they are part of an active workflow.
