# Importing Web Quick Start demo data

When you initially add the Web Quick Start dashlet into the site dashboard, the dashlet displays a link that enables you to import the Web Quick Start demo data.

1.  Click **Import Website Data**.

    Choose the sample content to import: **Government** or **Finance**.

    Both samples are identical in functionality but contain different images and section headings. The samples provide an example of how developers can package and import their own sample site data.

    The system imports the data for the demo website.

2.  Refresh the browser running Share.

    The Web Quick Start dashlet now displays a link to the **Web Quick Start Help**.


By default, Web Quick Start is configured to be accessed at `localhost` on port 8080. If these settings are relevant for your installation and the wcmqs.war is running in the same container as Alfresco, you will now be able to access the Web Quick Start editorial website on [http://localhost:8080/wcmqs](http://localhost:8080/wcmqs).

To change the server host name, port, or web application context from the default values, refer to [Configuring Web Quick Start](WQS-config.md).
