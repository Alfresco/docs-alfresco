# Editing an item inline

The **Inline Edit** action lets you edit plain text, HTML, and XML content items that were created using the **Create Content** feature in a site’s document library.

This task assumes you are in the library of the desired site.

This action is also available for content items configured with the aspect *Inline Editable*.

1.  Navigate the library’s folder structure to locate the content item you want to edit.

2.  Position the cursor over the item of interest in the item list to display the available actions.

3.  Click **More** and then click **Inline Edit**.

    The Edit Content page appears.

4.  Edit the item details and content as desired.

    The **Name** does not support the following special characters: \* " < \> \\ / . ? : and \|. When the name contains a disallowed character the **Save** button is disabled.

    **Note:** There is an exception regarding the period: the content name can include a period as long as it is not the last character. This allows you to add an extension \(for example, .txt, .html, or .xml\).

5.  Click **Save**.
