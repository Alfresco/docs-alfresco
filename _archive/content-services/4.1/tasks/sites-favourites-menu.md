# Marking the current site as a favorite

Marking a site as a favorite places it in the My Favorites list in the **Sites** menu so that you can quickly access it from anywhere in the application. You can tag any number of sites this way.

While you can manage your favorite sites from the My Sites dashlet on your personal dashboard, this action in the **Sites** menu conveniently allows you to mark the current site as a favorite without having to leave it.

-   Within a site expand the **Sites** menu on the toolbar and click **Add \[site name\] to Favorites**.

    **Note:** This action is available only for sites not already marked as a favorite.

    The current site will now appear in the **My Favorites** list in the **Sites** menu. It will also appear marked as a favorite on the My Sites dashlet on your personal dashboard.
