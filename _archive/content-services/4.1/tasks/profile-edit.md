# Editing your profile

Edit your user profile to update the information about you that is available to site users. In addition to providing personal and business details, you can upload a photograph.

1.  Expand the user menu on the toolbar and click **My Profile**.

    Your user profile appears, defaulting to the Info page.

2.  Click **Edit Profile**.

    Fields display the personal details, contact information, and company details that currently exist for your profile. The fields marked with an asterisk \(\*\) are required.

3.  Edit your user profile details, making changes and adding new information as desired.

    **Note:** To use the Google Docs functionality in the library, you must complete the **Google Username** field. Enter the email address you use for your Google account.

4.  Upload a photo to accompany your profile:

    1.  Click **Upload** in the Photo section.

    2.  Click the browse button on the Upload File dialog box.

    3.  Locate and upload the desired image.

        The selected file appears in the Upload File dialog box. Click **Remove** to delete the file listed, if necessary.

    4.  Click **Upload File\(s\)**.

    5.  Click **OK**.

    If a profile photo was already in place, uploading a new photo overwrites it.

    **Note:** Click **Use Default** to remove your photo. This displays the generic default image.

5.  Click **Save Changes** to save the profile details.


Your user profile displays your updated details.
