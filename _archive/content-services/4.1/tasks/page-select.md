# Selecting a component

Within a site the navigation bar on the dashboard banner displays the components that make up the site. Use these links to move around the site to explore, contribute, and collaborate on site content.

1.  Navigate to the desired site.

    The site banner displays the name of the selected site.

2.  On the navigation bar, click the component you want to access.

    The application displays the selected component and the component name is highlighted on the navigation bar. Each component has its own functionality. See the appropriate section of the documentation for instructions on using a component.

3.  On the navigation bar, click a component to change your location in the site or click **Site Dashboard** to return to the dashboard for the current site.
