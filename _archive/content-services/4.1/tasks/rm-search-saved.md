# Using a saved search

The Records Management site includes a number of default searches that you can use instead of creating your own. You also have access to searches you have created and saved yourself, as well as those created by other users.

This task assumes you are on the Search page.

1.  Click the **Saved Searches** menu to view the available search queries.

2.  Select a query.

    The **Critera** tab displays the query syntax and options.

3.  Click **Search**.

    The search results display in a table on the Results tab.
