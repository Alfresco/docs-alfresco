# Updating an external blog post

You update an external blog post to synchronize it with the version in the site blog.

This task assumes you are in the blog of the desired site.

Updating an internal post without updating the external post at the same time results in the internal post being marked as **Out of sync**. This status in the site blog is a visual indicator to remind you that the internal and external blogs are displaying two different versions of the post.

1.  Browse the blog posts to locate the external post you want to update.

    **Fastpath:** Select the **Published Externally** filter in the browsing pane to display only the externally published posts.

2.  Click **Update Externally** to synchronize the externally published post with the version in the site blog.

    Optionally, open the post to perform this action.


A message indicates the external post has been updated. The status **Out of sync** is replaced with the status **Published**.
