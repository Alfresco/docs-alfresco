# Subscribing to an RSS feed

Throughout the application, you have the opportunity to subscribe to RSS feeds. These feeds enable you to automatically receive regular updates on various activities.

The RSS Feed feature is available in the following locations:

-   Wiki
-   Blog
-   Library
-   Links
-   Discussions forum
-   My Activities dashlet on your personal dashboard
-   Site Activities dashlet on the site dashboard

An RSS Feed button or icon indicates where the feeds are available.

1.  Locate the feed you want to subscribe to.

2.  Click the **RSS Feed** button or icon.

    This initiates the subscription process. The user interface presented depends on the browser you are using.

3.  Choose to subscribe to the feed.

4.  Select a location to store the feed and then subscribe to it.

    **Tip:** RSS feeds credentials are stored by the browser you're using and not Alfresco. As such it's recommended that you close your browser after logging out of Alfresco and / or lock your computer while you're away from it.
