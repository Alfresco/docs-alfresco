# Locating items and folders

When you filter library content using one of the **Documents** or **Tags** browsing views, it is not possible to tell where an item or folder resides within the library folder structure. The **Locate File** and **Locate Folder** actions reveal the actual location of an item or folder in the library.

This task assumes you are in the library of the desired site and a **Documents** view \(All Documents, I'm Editing, Others are Editing, Recently Modified, Recently Added, or My Favorites\) or **Tag** view is selected in the browsing pane. To view the location of a folder the **Show Folders** feature must be enabled.

1.  In the item list position the cursor over the item or folder of interest to display the available actions.

2.  Depending on the type of content you have selected, click **Locate File**, or click **More** and then **Locate Folder**.


The page updates to display the selected folder or item as it exists in the library. The Library tree in the browsing pane shows the current location, as does the breadcrumb path at the top of the page.
