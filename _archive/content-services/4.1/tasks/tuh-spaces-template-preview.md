# Previewing a space in a template

You can preview a space in a template before choosing to apply the template.

On the Preview page, you can preview other spaces located in the same space with the selected template applied. Click ![Next](../images/im-nextitem.png) in the header to preview the next space; click ![Previous](../images/im-previousitem.png) to preview the previous space.

1.  Navigate to the space you want to preview in a template.

    The space header displays the name and details of the space.

3.  In the **Actions** list, click **Preview in Template**.

4.  In the header of the Preview page, select a template from the menu provided.

    The page displays a preview of the customized view the template represents.

5.  Continue previewing the templates until you find the template with your preferred customized view.
