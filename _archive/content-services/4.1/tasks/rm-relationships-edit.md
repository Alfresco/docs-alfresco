# Deleting a relationship



This task assumes that you are on the Link Relationships page of the Records Management Console.

1.  Locate the relationship you want to modify, and then click **Edit**.

    The Edit Relationship page displays. You can't change the relationship type; only the field values can be modified.

2.  Make the necessary changes:

    -   If the relationship type is Bi-directional, edit the Label field.
    -   If the relationship type is Parent/Child, edit the Source and Target fields.
3.  Click **Save**.
