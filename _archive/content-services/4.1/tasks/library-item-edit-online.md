# Editing your Microsoft Office documents online

The **Edit Online** feature lets you edit your document without first saving it offline \(checking it out\). An invisible check-out action ensures your document remains protected, or locked, in the library during the editing session. When you finish editing the document is invisibly checked in with the updated version available to other users.

This task assumes you are in the library of the desired site.

1.  Navigate the libraryâ€™s folder structure to locate the Microsoft Office document you want to edit.

2.  Position the cursor over the item of interest in the item list to display the available actions.

3.  Click **More** and then **Edit Online**.

    If the **Edit Online** action is not available you should check to make sure that:

    -   You are using Internet Explorer
    -   You are modifying an Office 2003 or greater file
    If you still cannot see the **Edit Online** action, contact your system administrator to enable it for you.

    A warning box appears prompting you to be sure the content can be trusted.

4.  Click **OK** to open the document.

    **Note:** If prompted for login credentials, type your user name and password, then click **OK**.

    The document opens in a separate window. In the library refresh the page to see the lock icon associated with the file.

    **Important:** If the file opens in Read-Only format contact your system administrator.

5.  Modify the file as necessary.

6.  Save and close the document.


This updates the document in the library with your changes.
