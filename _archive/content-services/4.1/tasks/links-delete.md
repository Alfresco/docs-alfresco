# Deleting a link

Delete a link to permanently remove it from the current site. This action also deletes any comments on the link.

This task assumes you are viewing the links for the desired site.

Only the Site Manager and the user who created the link can delete it.

1.  Browse the links to locate the one you want to delete.

    When deleting more than one link you can use the multiple selection feature provided.

2.  Position your cursor over the link to display the available actions and then click **Delete**.

    **Note:** Consider viewing the link first to ensure it is the one you want to delete. You can then select **Delete** on the link view page.

    A message prompts you to confirm the deletion.

3.  Click **Delete**.


A message indicates the selected link has been deleted.

-   **[Deleting multiple links](../tasks/links-delete-multiple.md)**  
In the links list you can quickly delete multiple links rather than removing them one at a time.
