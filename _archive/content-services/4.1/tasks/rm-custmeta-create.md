# Creating custom metadata

You can create custom metadata for record categories, record folders, records, and non-electronic documents. Once you create custom metadata, you cannot delete it.

This task assumes that you are on the Custom Metadata page of the Records Management Console.

1.  Select an option in the Object column: **Record Category**, **Record Folder**, **Record**, or **Non-Electronic Document**.

    The right column lists any custom metadata that has already been defined for the object selected.

2.  Click **New**.

    The **New Metadata** page displays.

3.  Type a name for the metadata in the **Label** field.

    This name is used as the label on the Edit Metadata page.

4.  Select the expected data value in the **Type** field.

    The type can be of the following values:

    |**Type**|**Description**|
    |--------|---------------|
    |**Text**|Sets the value of this metadata to be a text string. When you select this option, you can set the **Use selection list** check box.|
    |**Boolean**|Sets the value of this metadata to be either True or False.|
    |**Date**|Sets the value of this metadata to be a numeric date sequence.|

    **Note:** The **Use selection list** option appears only when a list has been created in the List of Values tool.

5.  To configure this metadata field as a selection menu,:

    1.  Select the **Use selection list** check box.

    2.  Select a list name from the menu.

6.  Select the **Mandatory Field** check box to set this metadata to be a mandatory entry on the Edit Metadata page.

7.  Click **Create**.


The new metadata displays in the right column of the Custom Metadata page.
