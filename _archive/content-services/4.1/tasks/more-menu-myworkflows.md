# Workflows I've Started

The Workflows I’ve Started page lets you view and manage the workflows that you initiated. On this page you can view a summary of your workflows, filter the workflow list, and cancel a workflow.

1.  On the toolbar expand the **More** menu and click **Workflows I’ve Started**.

    The Workflows I’ve Started page appears displaying a list of all workflows you created. The summary provided for each workflow includes:

    -   workflow name
    -   due date
    -   date started
    -   workflow type
    -   priority \(displayed as an icon that indicates the task is of high, medium, or low priority\)
    Where the list contains more workflows than can be displayed on a single page, navigation links appear at the top of the workflow list. The number in bold indicates your current page. Click a page number to display a specific page. Use the previous \(<<\) and next \(\>\>\) links to move forward and backward through multiple pages of workflows.

2.  Use the filters provided to view a subset of the workflows.

    The browsing pane on the left side of the page enables you to display a specific set of workflows. The options are:

    -   **Workflows**

        Display all workflows

    -   **Due**

        Filter workflows by due date: **Today**, **Tomorrow**, **Next 7 Days**, **Overdue**, **No Date**

    -   **Started**

        Filter workflows by start date: **Last 7 days**, **Last 14 days**, **Last 28 days**

    -   **Priority**

        Filter workflows by priority: **High**, **Medium**, **Low**

    -   **Workflow Type**

        Filter the workflows by type

3.  Manage your workflows.

    Position your cursor over a task to reveal the available actions:

    -   **View Workflow**: Displays the workflow details
    -   **Cancel Workflow**: Cancels the selected workflow
    **Note:** On this page you can click **Start Workflow** beneath the banner to initiate a new workflow.

From the Workflows I’ve Started page, you can view the full details of a workflow, including a workflow summary, details on the most recently completed task, and a summary of all tasks generated by the workflow.
-   **[Cancelling a workflow](../tasks/more-menu-myworkflows-cancel.md)**  
Cancel an existing workflow when it is no longer required. This deletes all tasks related to the workflow.
