# Changing or removing a template applied to a space

You can easily change the template currently applied to a space or remove it completely.

    The space header displays the name and details of the space you are working with.

2.  In the **More Actions**menu, click **View Details**.

    The Details page appears.

3.  In the Custom View pane, click ![Expand](../images/im-expand.png) to expand the pane, if it is not open.

4.  Modify the space as follows:

    -   Click ![Remove](../images/im-delete.png) **\(Remove\)** to remove the currently applied template.
    -   Click ![Modify](../images/im-modify-customview.png) **\(Modify\)** to display the Apply Template page. Select a different template and click **OK**. You return to the Details page.
5.  Click **Close** to return to the current space.
