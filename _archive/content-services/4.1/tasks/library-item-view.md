# Viewing an item

The preview feature enables you to view a content item directly in the application without having to download it to your computer or check it out. For documents containing multiple pages, navigation features enable you to view all pages. In addition to the preview this page displays full document details and a comment feature that enables site members to add comments on the item being viewed.

This task assumes you are in the library of the desired site.

While you may wish to simply preview a content item on the details page, there is a great deal of functionality available to you here. This task describes all of the features available on the details page.

1.  Navigate the libraryâ€™s folder structure to locate the content item you want to view.

2.  Click the name or thumbnail of the desired item in the item list to display the details page.

    The left side of the page displays a preview of the selected item. Above this you see the basic item information: folder in which the item is located, item name, version number, the user who last modified the item, and the date/time of the modification. An icon to the left of these details indicates the file type.

    **Note:** When the content item does not have a file type extension or the extension is not recognized, a generic icon is displayed.

    A **Download** button is conveniently placed in this header as it is one of the most common actions performed on a content item.

    The actions **Favorite**, **Like**, and **Comment** allow you to add it to your list of favorite library items, like the item, or add a comment to it. Once you favorite or like an item, you always have the option of undoing the action. Counters indicate the number of people who have liked the content and the number of comments added.

    The right side of the page displays the details for the selected item, as well as all of the actions you can perform. The information and actions are grouped in sections that can be expanded and collapsed so that you see only the information that interests you.

    The comments can be found beneath the preview with the most recent comment at the top of the list.
