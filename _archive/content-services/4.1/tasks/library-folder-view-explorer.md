# Viewing a folder in Alfresco Explorer

The **View in Alfresco Explorer**action lets you display the selected folder in the Alfresco Explorer web client. This gives you access to all relevant Explorer actions.

This task assumes you are in the library of the desired site and that the **Show Folders** feature is enabled.

1.  In the item list position the cursor over the folder of interest to display the available actions.

2.  Click **More** and then **View in Alfresco Explorer**.

    A new browser window opens displaying the Alfresco Explorer login page. You must log in to the Explorer client the first time you use this action.

3.  If prompted, provide the appropriate **User Name** and **Password**, then click **Login**.


Alfresco Explorer displays the details page for the selected folder.
