# OpenSearch

OpenSearch enables you to connect to other available OpenSearch services, such as other Alfresco repositories, to expand your search outside the current repository.

If no other OpenSearch services are available, you can search your current repository only. This differs from Search in that the search results display on the left pane and your working space context remains the same.

1.  In the sidebar, click ![](../images/im-menu.png) and select **OpenSearch** if it is not already displayed.

2.  Type your query in the search box.

3.  Specify the number of items you want to see returned per page for the search results.

4.  Check the boxes for the available OpenSearch services you want to query for your search. By default, you use OpenSearch to search within your current Alfresco repository.

5.  Click ![Search](../images/im-search.png) **\(Search\)**.

    The search results display below the Search pane, categorized by the OpenSearch services you checked.
