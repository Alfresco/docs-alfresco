    The space header displays the name and details of the selected space.

2.  In the Content Itemspane, click ![View Details](../images/im-viewdetails.png) **\(View Details\)** for the content item of interest.

    The Detailspage appears.

3.  In the **Actions** list, click **Manage Content Users**.

4.  On the Manage Content Users page, click ![Remove](../images/im-user-delete.png) **\(Remove\)** for the user or group you want to remove.

    In this list, the icon ![User](../images/im-user.png) to the left of the name indicates a user; the icon ![Group](../images/im-group.png) indicates a group.
