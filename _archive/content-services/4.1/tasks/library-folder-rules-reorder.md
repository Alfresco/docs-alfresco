# Reordering the rules in the rule set

As part of managing your rule set you can pick the order Alfresco runs the rules. If your folder has inherited rules, those are always run first in the order they're listed. Any rules marked as inactive are simplly skipped.

1.  Hover over a folder with rules applied \(indicated by the ![](../images/rules-icon.png) icon\) and click ![Add Event icon](../images/AddEvent_icon.png) **More** then ![](../images/rules-icon.png) **Manage Rules**.

2.  On the left side of the page, click and drag rules to where you want them in the list.

    **Note:** You can't reorder linked or inherited rules here; that has to be done in the folder where they were created. Click **Reset** to return the rule set to its last saved order.

3.  Click **Save**.
