# Managing content item details

You can view the details \(properties and metadata\) of a content item at any time.

1.  Click ![View Details](../images/im-viewdetails.png) **\(View Details\)** associated with the content item to display the Details page with the Properties pane expanded.

    If you are not sure which icon performs what action, hover your mouse over the icon and a tool tip displays its action.
