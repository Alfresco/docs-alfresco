# Replying to a posted topic

You can reply to a posted topic to take part in a discussion on a specific topic.

Two views are available when browsing posts: **Bubble View** and **Details View**. The selected view is displayed in the space header. In Bubble View, posts and replies are represented differently, so you can more easily see the discussion flow.

**Note:** To change the view in the Browse Posts pane, click the current view \(**Bubble View** or **Details View**\) and select the alternate view.

1.  Navigate to the topic you want to reply to.

    The space header displays the topic subject; the Browse Posts pane displays the post message and details as well as any existing replies.

2.  Click ![Post Reply](../images/im-postreply.png) **\(Post Reply\)**.

3.  In the **Message** box, type your message and click **Reply**.

    The reply is posted in the Browse Posts pane.
