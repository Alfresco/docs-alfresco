# Saving a search

This task assumes that you are on the Search page, viewing the results of a search query on the Results tab.

1.  Click **Save Search**.

2.  In the **Name** box, type a name for the search query. This field is required.

3.  In the **Description** box, type a short explanation about what the search query returns.

4.  Click **Save**.

    The search you save will be available for all site members.


The saved search displays in the **Saved Searches** menu on the Search page. The same list is available in the navigation pane of the File Plan.

**Note:** The saved search feature saves only the search query and not the results. This means that when you next use the saved search, you may get different results, depending on the activity in the Records Management system.

**Parent topic:**[Searching records](../concepts/rm-search.md)
