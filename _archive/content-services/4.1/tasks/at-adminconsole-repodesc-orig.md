# Viewing the Repository Descriptor

There are two Repository Descriptor pages.

The Repository Descriptor \(Originally Installed\) page shows the details about the Alfresco repository when it was originally installed.

The Repository Descriptor \(Current\) page shows the details about the Alfresco repository as they currently stand. The properties on this page are the same as on the Repository Descriptor \(Originally Installed\) page, but it shows the most current information.

These pages are for viewing only and cannot be edited.

1.  Open the Admin Console, and then click either:

    -   **Repository Descriptor \(Originally Installed\)**
    -   **Repository Descriptor \(Current\)**
2.  View the repository properties:
