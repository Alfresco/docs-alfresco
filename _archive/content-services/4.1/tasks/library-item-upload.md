# Updating content

You can upload content from your computer to easily update a content item in the library. You can perform this task on a locked or unlocked library item.

This task assumes you are in the library of the desired site.

To check in an item you perform this task in the **I'm Editing** view. This will upload the new version while releasing the lock on the library item. You can also use this action on an unlocked content item to update it without first downloading it to your computer.

1.  Navigate the library to locate the content item you want to update.

    **Note:** Click **Iâ€™m Editing** in the **Documents** section of the browsing pane to view the content items you currently have checked out.

2.  In the item list position the cursor over the item you want to update to display the available actions.

3.  Click **Upload New Version**.

    The Update File page appears.

4.  Click the browse button.

5.  Locate the file on your computer that you want to upload and click **Open**.

    The selected item appears in the list. Click **Remove** to delete the item if necessary.

6.  Indicate if the revision is minor or major.

7.  In the **Comments** box type any information relevant to the updates.

8.  Click **Upload File\(s\)**.

    An indicator informs you of the upload progress. When 100% appears beside the file you can proceed.

9.  Click **OK**.


The dialog box closes and the item is updated. If you updated a checked out item, it is removed from the item list in the **I'm Editing** view.
