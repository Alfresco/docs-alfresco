# Emailing space users

If you want to email users of a space to let them know about some changes to that space, you can do it from within the space itself.

1.  Navigate to the space whose users you want to contact.

    The space header displays the name and details of the space.

2.  In the **More Action**s menu, click **View Details**.

    The Details page appears.

3.  In the **Actions** list, click **Email Space users**.

    The Email Space users page appears.

4.  Type a subject for the email.

5.  Provide an email message in one of two ways:

    -   Type the desired text in the **Message** box.
    -   Select a template from the **Use Template** list.
6.  Click **OK** to send the message to the users of the current space.
