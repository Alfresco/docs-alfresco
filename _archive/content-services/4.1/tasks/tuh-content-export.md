# Exporting a space and its contents

Export a space to copy the space, its contents, and all rules, workflow, properties, and metadata associated with the space to a new location within Alfresco.

Exporting a space and its contents bundles all the content into an Alfresco Content Package \(ACP\).

1.  Navigate to the space you want to export.

    The space header displays the name and details of the space.

2.  In the **More Actions** menu, click **View Details**.

    The Details page appears.

3.  In the **Actions** list, click **Export**.

4.  On the Export page, type a name for the export package \(ACP\).

5.  Select a destination location to store the resulting ACP file.

6.  Select **Current Space** as what you would like to export from.

    1.  Check **Include Children** if you want to export sub spaces.

    2.  Check **Include this Space**if you want to export the selected space as well as the children.

7.  Check **Run export in background**if you want the export to occur while you are still working.

8.  Click **OK**.

    The ACP file is created and stored in the destination location.
