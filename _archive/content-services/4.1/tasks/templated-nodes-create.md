# Setting files as templates

In the Node Templates folder you can store documents that users can then use as document templates.

1.  In the Alfresco **Repository** open the **Data Dictionary** then **Node Templates**.

2.  Either drag and drop a content item that you want to use as a template onto the **Node Templates** drag and drop area, or click **Upload** and browse to and select the required file.

    **Note:** The standard Alfresco **Create Content** options are also available, so that you can create templates directly from Alfresco, in just the same way as a user would create new content.

    If you already have templated nodes set up, you can select to create content **By Templated Node** and create additional templates based on your existing templates.

3.  Click **OK** when the upload is complete.


The file is now available to your users as a template when they select to create content **By Templated Node**.
