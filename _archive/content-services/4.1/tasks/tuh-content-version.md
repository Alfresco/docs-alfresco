# Adding versioning to content

Enable versioning for a content item to track the revisions made to that item.

When enabled, a new version number is assigned to the item each time its content is checked in or updated. When you use the **Update** feature, you do not have the opportunity to enter version notes.

1.  Navigate to the space containing the content item you want to version.

2.  In the Content Items pane, click ![View Details](../images/im-viewdetails.png) **\(View Details\)** for the content item of interest.

3.  On the Details page, scroll down to the Version History pane. Click ![Expand](../images/im-expand.png) to expand this pane, if necessary.

    **This document has no version history**is displayed if the content item does not yet have versioning.

4.  Click **Allow Versioning**.

    The history table appears with the current version set at 1.0 for this item. As the content is versioned, previous iterations are available in this table.

5.  Click **Close** in the top right of the pane to return to the current space.
