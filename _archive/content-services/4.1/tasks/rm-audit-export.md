# Exporting the audit log

Export allows you to archive the audit log periodically and enables, for example, external auditors to examine or analyze system activity. When you export the audit log, this does not affect the audit log in the system. The audit log is exported as an HTML file.

This task assumes that you are on the Audit page of the Records Management Console and that it displays a list of log entries that you want to export.

1.  Click **Export**.

    You are prompted to open or save the file.

2.  Choose to save the file to your computer.

    Depending on your browser, you are either prompted to specify a destination or the item is automatically downloaded to a default location.

3.  Close the dialog box once the download is complete.
