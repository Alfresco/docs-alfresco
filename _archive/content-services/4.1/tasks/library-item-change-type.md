# Changing the content type

Each library item has a default content type. You can change the content type from its default to a more specific value.

This task assumes you are in the library of the desired site.

Where properties are defined for the configured types, you are able to enhance the item by augmenting the type \(for example, changing a standard document to a policy document\) and then adding the appropriate property for that content type. The property then appears on both the details page and the Edit Properties page for that content item.

1.  Locate and view the content item whose type you want to change.

2.  On the details page click **Change Type**.

    The Change Type dialog box appears.

3.  Select the desired type.

    **Note:** The **New Type** list remains empty until types are defined by a system administrator.

4.  Click **OK**.
