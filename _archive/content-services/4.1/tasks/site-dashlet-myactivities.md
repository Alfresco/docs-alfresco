# Site Activities dashlet

The Site Activities dashlet lets you easily follow what is going on in this site by listing the site activities, such as content additions, edits, and deletions, as well as changes in site membership. Activities are also recorded when members like and comment on library items.

On this dashlet you can:

-   Use the filter to display the activities by ownership, type, and time period. You can display only your activities, only other usersâ€™ activities, or all activities. You can also view only a specific type of activity, such as changes in membership or status updates.

-   Click the RSS Feed icon to subscribe to the feed to automatically receive the activity updates.

    **Note:** The only users notified of deletions are the user who made the deletion and the Alfresco Administrator.
