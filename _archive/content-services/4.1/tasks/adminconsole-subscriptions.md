# Managing subscriptions to follow users

The Subscriptions page allows you to enable or disable the Follow feature for users to follow each other in Share.

1.  Open the Admin Console, and then click **Subscriptions**.

2.  On the Subscriptions page, click **Edit**.

    You see the Edit: Subscriptions page.

3.  Use the **Enabled** checkbox to choose whether to enable or disable the Follow feature for all users:

    -   Select the checkbox to enable subscriptions
    -   Deselect the checkbox to disable subscriptions
    The **Enabled** checkbox is selected by default. This allows users to follow other users and then filter activities according to who they are following. If you disable subscriptions, users will not be able to follow users and they will not see the activities. For example, on the **My Profile** page, the **I'm Following** and **Following Me** options are not visible.

4.  Click **Save** to apply the changes you have made to the properties.

    If you do not want to save the changes, click **Cancel**.
