# Performing actions on multiple items and folders

Once you select the library items and/or folders you want to work with you can select an action to perform.

This task assumes you are in the library of the desired site and you have selected the items and/or folders you want to work with.

The **Selected Items** list in the header displays the actions available to be performed on multiple items. They are:

-   **Copy to…**

    Copies the selected items/folders to a single location that you specify. This can be in the same site, a different site, or a space in the Explorer repository.

-   **Move to…**

    Moves the selected items/folders to a single location that you specify. This can be in the same site, a different site, or a space in the Explorer repository.

-   **Delete**

    Deletes the selected items/folders.

-   **Start Workflow**

    Assigns identical workflow, as specified, to the selected items.

-   **Manage Permissions**

    Assigns identical permissions, as specified, to the selected items/folders.

-   **Sync to cloud**

    Synchronizes the selected items with your Alfresco in the cloud account.

-   **Deselect All**

    Clears the check boxes of the currently selected items/folders.


To perform an action on the selected library items and/or folders:

1.  Click **Selected Items** in the header.

    A list displays the available actions.

2.  Click the desired action.

    When you click **Deselect All** to clear the selected items, you cannot perform another action until you reselect the desired content.


Refer to the appropriate topic in the section [Working with individual library items](../concepts/library-items-individual.md) for details on completing the selected action.
