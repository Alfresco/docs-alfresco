# Editing the list details

Edit an existing list to modify its title and description.

This task assumes you are viewing the data lists for the desired site.

Only a Site Manager, a Site Collaborator, and the user who created the list can edit it.

1.  In the browsing pane position your cursor over the list you want to edit to display the available actions.

2.  Click the **Edit Details**action.

    The Edit List Details dialog box appears displaying the current list details.

3.  Make the desired changes to the title and description.

    CAUTION:

    You will not be prevented from creating lists with duplicate titles. Review the existing lists to ensure your list name is unique.

4.  Click **Save**.
