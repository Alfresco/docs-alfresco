# Viewing record category details

The record category details page gives you access to the actions available to be performed on the category; the custom metadata; the disposition schedule; and the folder URL.

1.  In the File Plan, locate the record category whose details you want to view.

2.  In the item list, position the cursor over the category of interest to display the available actions.

3.  Click **View Details**.

    The details page displays. On this page, you can see the metadata, the disposition schedule, and the available actions in the Actions list.

    If no disposition schedule has been set for the record category, you create it here. If a disposition schedule exists, you can edit it.

    Where a disposition schedule exists, click **View Description** in the Disposition Steps section to display the description for a particular step.

4.  Click the breadcrumb link to return to the item list.
