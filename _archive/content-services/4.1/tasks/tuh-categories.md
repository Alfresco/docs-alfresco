# Categories

The **Categories** feature in the sidebar enables you to filter the content items in the repository by a predefined set of categories. Categories are defined by the System Administrator and associated with content items by users.

1.  In the sidebar, click ![Expand](../images/im-expand.png) to the left of a category to display its sub-categories.

2.  Click a category to populate the Content Items pane with all repository items associated with that category.

    Select **Browse items in sub-categories?** to display the content items associated with the selected category and any of its sub-categories.
