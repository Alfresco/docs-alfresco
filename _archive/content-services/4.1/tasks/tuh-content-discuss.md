# Discussing content

When developing a piece of content in collaboration with other colleagues, you can discuss specific objects with selected colleagues.

A forum is automatically created for the content item and you can organize messages in topics.

1.  Navigate to the space containing the content item you want to discuss.

2.  Click ![Menu](../images/im-menu.png) for the content of interest and click **Start Discussion**.

3.  On the Create Topic pane, enter the discussion details in the **Subject** and **Message** boxes. Optionally, select an icon to represent the type of message you are posting.

4.  Click **Create Topic**.

    A new pane appears with the header displaying the subject you entered for your topic.

5.  Navigate back to the space containing the content item being discussed. In the Content Items pane, ![View Discussions](../images/im-viewdiscussions.png) **\(View Discussions\)** has been added to alert your colleagues that discussions on this content have started.

6.  To view discussions on a content item, click ![View Discussions](../images/im-viewdiscussions.png) **\(View Discussions\)** for that content item.
