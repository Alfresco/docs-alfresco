# Accessing the Data Lists component

Access the data lists component to view the lists created for the current site.

In this component you can create new lists, as well as edit and delete any lists that you created.

1.  Navigate to the desired site.

2.  On the navigation bar click **Data Lists**.

    **Note:** Within each site the component names can be customized. If the site manager has done this, the link in the navigation bar may have a label other than **Data Lists**.

    This opens the component. The browsing pane displays a list of all existing data lists for the current site.


**Parent topic:**[Data lists](../concepts/datalists-intro.md)
