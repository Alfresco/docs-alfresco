# Accessing the calendar

Access the calendar to view upcoming events for the current site.

Within the calendar you can create events, as well as edit and delete any events that you created.

1.  Navigate to the desired site.

2.  On the navigation bar click **Calendar**.

    **Note:** Within each site the component names can be customized. If the site manager has done this, the link in the navigation bar may have a label other than **Calendar**.

    This opens the calendar which defaults to the Month view. Any events scheduled in the current month appear on the calendar.
