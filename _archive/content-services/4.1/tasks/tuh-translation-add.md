# Adding a translation

If you have completed a translation of your source content item outside the repository, you can add it in the context of the multilingual content.

1.  On the Manage Multilingual Content page, click **Add Translation** in the **Actions** list.

2.  On the Add Translation page, locate the content to upload.

3.  Verify the properties and select the language of the translated content.

4.  Uncheck **Modify all properties when this page closes** and click **OK**.

    The new content displays in the space with the language code identified. If you have set your **Content Language** option on the User Profile and Settings page to a specific language, you will only see the document for that language.
