# Configuring email archive settings in Outlook

You can configure Microsoft Outlook to archive email in Alfresco, including archiving emails as links.

You can decide what format you want to use to save your emails, and how to archive your emails. In the Email Archiving tab, you can take one or more of the following actions:

-   Compress the email message while uploading the content
-   Save the original Outlook MSG file in Alfresco with the original email
-   Save attachments as separate documents in Alfresco
-   Save email as a link to the content in Alfresco
-   Use default storage settings \(where all emails are saved to the Alfresco server, based on the option selected in Default storage settings\)
-   Enter metadata when archiving \(to tag emails\)
-   Show storage settings when archiving \(to select how each email will be archived\)

You can reduce the size of your Outlook inbox by archiving emails as links to the content in Alfresco:

1.  Select Configure from the Alfresco Client tab in Microsoft Outlook to open the configuration screen.

    The Configure Alfresco Outlook Client screen is displayed with tabs for Connection, Email Archiving, Extended, Configuration, and License.

2.  Click the Email Archiving tab.

3.  Click **Archive as link** in the Default archive settings section, and your preferred option in the Email archive settings section.

    **Archive as link** saves the email \(the original EML file\) in Alfresco and a partial email \(without text and attachments\) in Microsoft Outlook.

    **Note:** When the email is archived, the original complete email exists in Alfresco only. Outlook contains a link to this email. If you click the **Download original email message** link in an archived email, the original email is loaded from Alfresco and can be opened in Outlook.


Outlook emails are archived to the Alfresco server, and can be accessed using links in Microsoft Outlook.
