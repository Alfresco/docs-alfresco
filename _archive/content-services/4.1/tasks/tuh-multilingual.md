# Managing multilingual content

You can work with a view of all the multilingual aspects of content to manage its translations.

From here you can see all the translations and add additional ones. You can also see information about the version history of the complete translation collection. This is called an *Edition*.

To manage the multilingual content:

1.  Navigate to the translated content item you want to manage.

2.  In the Content Items pane, click ![View Details](../images/im-viewdetails.png) **\(View Details\)** for the content item of interest.

    The Details page appears.

3.  In the **Actions** list, click **Manage Multilingual Content**. From the Manage Multilingual Content page, you can perform the following functions:

    -   [Adding a translation](tuh-translation-add.md)
    -   [Adding a translation without content](tuh-translation-add-nocontent.md)
    -   [Creating a new edition of the translated content](tuh-newedition-create.md)
    -   [Viewing the translated content editions](tuh-newedition-view.md)

-   **[Adding a translation](../tasks/tuh-translation-add.md)**  
If you have completed a translation of your source content item outside the repository, you can add it in the context of the multilingual content.
-   **[Adding a translation without content](../tasks/tuh-translation-add-nocontent.md)**  
Adding a translation without content enables you to give other language equivalent values to all the properties and then add the translated content later when available. This is useful when using workflow to manage the translation process.
-   **[Creating new editions of the translated content](../tasks/tuh-newedition-create.md)**  
You may start a new edition based on any of the translations and this becomes the current document.
-   **[Viewing the translated content editions](../tasks/tuh-newedition-view.md)**  
Once you have created a new edition, you can view the updated related content.
