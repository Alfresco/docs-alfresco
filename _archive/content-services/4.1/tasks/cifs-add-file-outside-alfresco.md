# Add a file to Alfresco from outside the Alfresco interface

You can easily drag and drop content to the repository from outside the Alfresco interface.

**Note:** This functionality is available in a Windows environment if the Alfresco repository has been mapped by your administrator so that you can access it from Windows Explorer.

1.  Select a file in Windows Explorer or your desktop.

2.  Drag the file onto the location in the Alfresco repository that you want to add it to.

    The file is added to the selected location in the Alfresco repository.
