# Viewing synchronized content in the cloud

After you synchronize content to the cloud, you can use the **View in Cloud** feature to open the cloud site the content is synced to. This can be especially useful if you locked the content on your Enterprise site.

1.  Position the cursor over a folder or item that you have synced to the cloud in the item list.

    **Tip:** Items and folders synced to the cloud display the ![](../images/cloud-icon.png) icon.

2.  Click **More** and then **View in Cloud**.

    **Tip:** You can also access **View in Cloud** from the item preview after clicking on an item, or by clicking the item name in the **Sync Info**box.

    The synced cloud site will open, displaying your content.

    **Note:** If you aren't logged into the cloud you'll need to enter your email and password.
