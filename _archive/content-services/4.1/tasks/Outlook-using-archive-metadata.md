# Adding metadata to email during archiving in Outlook

When you archive an email in Outlook, the email is saved in Alfresco. If archiving is configured to allow metadata entry, a dialog appears before transfer of the email to Alfresco.

In the Add Metadata dialog box, optionally enter keywords \(tags\) and an additional email description. If you do not want to add information, click **Archive without metadata**.

1.  Enter your chosen metadata or tags in Keywords.

2.  Enter additional information in Description.

3.  Select one or more of the additional check box options to store the original Outlook MSG file, extract email attachments, or to archive the email as a link.

4.  Click either **Archive with metadata** or **Archive without metadata**.


Your email is now archived, with any additional information that you have specified.
