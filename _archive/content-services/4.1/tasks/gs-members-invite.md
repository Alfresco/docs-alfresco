# Inviting members to your site

Now that you've created a site and added content, the next step is to invite other Alfresco users to the site.

1.  Click **Invite** at the top of the dashboard to open the Invite page.

    **Tip:** You don't need to be on your site dashboard to do this - the **Invite** option is available from everywhere in your site.

2.  In the **Search for People** section, type the full or partial name of a user you want to invite and click **Search**.

    **Important:** An internal user is someone in your organization. This tutorial will add the test user, Alice Beecher, but if your Alfresco administrator has already set up users via the Admin Console \(administrators only - on the toolbar, expand the **More** menu and click **Users**\) you can add real users if you prefer.

3.  Click **Add** to add the user to the **Invite Users** list.

4.  Click **Select Role** and select **Collaborator**.

    **Note:** You can set different roles for different users; take a look at the Alfresco documentation for more details on user roles.

5.  Click Invite.


An email invitation is sent to each person that you invited. Once they've accepted the invitation they'll be able to start sharing content on your site.

This video shows the steps in the tutorial.
