# Creating a reply

2.  Click the name of the topic to open it.

    The topic view displays the selected topic in its entirety along with any existing replies.

3.  Click **Reply**.

4.  Type your content in the **Add Reply** box.

    Use the features provided to format the text; insert bulleted and numbered lists; change the font color; and insert or edit links, anchors, and images. To assist with editing, use the undo, redo, and remove formatting features as needed. Additional features are also provided; position the cursor over an icon to display its function.

    Click and drag the bottom right corner to resize the text editor.
