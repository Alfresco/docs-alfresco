# Browsing the calendar

The main view defaults to a calendar displaying the current month. The browsing pane to the left provides another calendar for navigating the months without affecting the main view.

This task assumes you are viewing the calendar for the desired site.

Use the navigation features on the main view and in the browsing pane to populate the agenda.

1.  Use the navigation buttons in the header to change the main calendar view:

    1.  Use the **Day**, **Week**, and **Month** buttons to change the main display to a daily, weekly, or monthly view.

    2.  Use the **Previous** and **Next** buttons to move forward and backward through the calendar, either a day, week, or month at a time, depending on the current view.

    3.  Click **Agenda** to view a list of the upcoming events scheduled for this site.

    4.  Click **Today** to display the current date.

        By default the Day and Week views display only the working hours. Click the **Show all hours** icon in the header to display the full day. When all hours are displayed, click **Show working hours** to change the display.

2.  Use the calendar in the browsing pane to navigate through the months without affecting the main view.

    1.  Click **<** to display the previous month.

    2.  Click **\>** to display the next month.

    3.  Click **This Month** beneath the calendar to reset it to the current month. The current day and any dates with scheduled events are highlighted.

3.  Click a date on the browsing pane calendar to load the selected date on the calendar in the main view.

4.  Click a tag in the **Tags** list to display only the events associated with that tag.

    Click **Show All Items** to display all events.

5.  Click an event in the calendar to view its full details.

6.  Click **iCal Feed** in the header to take advantage of calendar data exchange.
