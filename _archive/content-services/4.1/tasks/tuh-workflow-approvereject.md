# Approving and rejecting a content item

If a content item is part of a simple workflow – that is, it resides in a space for which simple content review workflow has been defined – you can approve it. The approve action may be followed in the action list by a rejection action.

The actions are represented by the icons ![Approval icon](../images/im-approve.png) \(accept\) and ![Rejection icon](../images/im-reject.png) \(reject\). The text label for these actions is user defined, so will vary.

1.  Navigate to the space containing the content item you want to approve or reject.

2.  In the Content Items pane, click ![Menu](../images/im-menu.png) to display the available actions.

3.  Click the approval action \(![Approval icon](../images/im-approve.png)\) or click the rejection action \(![Rejection icon](../images/im-reject.png)\), as appropriate.
