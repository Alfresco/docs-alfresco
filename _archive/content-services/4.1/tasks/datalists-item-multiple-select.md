# Selecting multiple list items

There are two methods to select multiple list items in the current data list. You can select any number of items.

This task assumes you are viewing the data lists for the desired site and the list you want to work with is displayed.

-   Select the desired list items in one of the following ways:

    -   Click a check box to select the associated list item.
    -   Click **Select** at the top of the data list and click **All**.
    Click **None** to clear the list selections. Click **Invert Selection** to toggle the check boxes to their opposite state.
