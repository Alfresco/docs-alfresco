# Exporting content

Exporting a container bundles the contents and structure into an Alfresco Content Package \(ACP\). You can also choose to export the content as a ZIP file. This allows you to move entire blocks of content – record categories, record folders, records, metadata, and disposition schedules – within a File Plan or to another File Plan.

1.  Navigate to the File Plan and select the container you want to export. This can be a category or a folder.

2.  Click **Export All**.

3.  Choose to save the file to your computer.

    Depending on your browser, you are either prompted to specify a destination or the file is automatically downloaded to a default location. Finish saving the file as appropriate for your browser setup.
