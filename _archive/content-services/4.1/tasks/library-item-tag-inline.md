# Tagging library content

You can conveniently create and manage the tags for a content item directly in the library item list. The inline tagging feature is available for both items and folders.

This task assumes you are in the library of the desired site. The item list must be displayed in the detailed view. To perform this task on a folder the **Show Folders** feature must be enabled.

1.  Navigate the libraryâ€™s folder structure to locate the content you want to work with.

2.  In the item list position the cursor over the existing tag or, if the item has no tag, over the label **No Tags**.

    An icon appears to the left of the name.

3.  Click the **Tag** icon to enter editing mode.

4.  Manage the item tagging as follows:

    -   In the field provided, type the tag you want to add. A tag can be a single word or a string of words. Quotation marks are not required for multi-word tags. Press ENTER to create the tag. You can enter any number of tags.

        **Fastpath:** As you type, a list of possible matches may display. Select from this list to add a tag that has already been used in this site.

    -   Click an existing tag to enter editing mode for that tag. Make the desired changes and then press ENTER.
    -   Click the **X** to the right of a tag to remove it from the content.
5.  Click **Save** to process the changes.

    The item list displays the updated tagging details.

    **Note:** You can also edit the tags for a content item or folder by editing its properties.
