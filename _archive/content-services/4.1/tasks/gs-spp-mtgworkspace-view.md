# View the Meeting Workspace

Once a meeting connected to a Meeting Workspace exists on your calendar, you can access that workspace directly from Outlook.

To view your Meeting Workspace from Outlook:

1.  On the Calendar view in Outlook, locate the meeting you just created.

2.  Right-click the meeting and select **View Meeting Workspace**.

3.  When prompted, log in as the administrator \(admin, admin\).

    The Project\_Planning Meeting Workspace \(Share site\) opens with the calendar component displayed.

4.  Click **Members** on the banner to display the Search for Site Members page.

5.  Click **Search** to view the current members.

    The page displays the current members:

    -   The administrator created the meeting and workspace; this user has the role of site Manager.
    -   User A and User B were added as meeting attendees; they have the default role of site Collaborator.
6.  Log out of Share and close the browser.
