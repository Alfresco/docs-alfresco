# Requesting synchronization

Your synchronized content will be updated automatically as it changes. However, you may want to run a manual synchronization on a single content item to ensure changes are transferred to the cloud immediately.

This task assumes you are in the library of the desired site. To synchronize a folder and its contents the **Show Folders** feature must be enabled.

1.  Locate the folder or content item you want to synchronize to Alfresco in the cloud.

2.  Click **Request Sync**.
