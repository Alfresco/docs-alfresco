# Organizing your content

The drag and drop functionality in the library lets you easily move a single item or folder to another location within the current site.

This task assumes you are in the library of the desired site. To move a folder and its contents the **Show Folders** feature must be enabled. This functionality is available for both the Simple view and the Detailed view.

1.  Navigate the libraryâ€™s folder structure to locate the content you want to move.

    You can move a content item or a folder. When you relocate a folder all of its content, including subfolders, move with it.

2.  In the item list, click the thumbnail of the item you want to relocate. Do not release the mouse button.

3.  Drag the item to the target folder. This can be a folder in the library tree in the browsing pane or in the breadcrumb path beneath the site banner.

    **Note:** The target folder must be visible in the tree before you attempt to move it. There is no way to expand the tree while performing the drop.

    The target folder appears highlighted in the tree or the breadcrumb path.

4.  Release the mouse button to drop the item in its new location.

    Use the **Move to** action to relocate multiple content items to a single location within the current site or to another site.
