# Publishing a post to an external blog

In addition to publishing a blog post to the site's internal blog you can publish a post to a configured external blog. To publish a draft post externally you must also publish it internally.

This task assumes you are in the blog of the desired site.

1.  Browse the blog posts to locate the one you want to publish.

2.  Click **Publish Externally**.

    Optionally, open the post to perform this action.


A message indicates the selected blog post is published. The text \(Published\) appears after the title and a link to the external blog is added to the post summary.

**Parent topic:**[The blog](../concepts/blog-intro.md)
