# Managing content permissions

You can override the default site permissions for any content you add to the document library. This lets you control what site members can see and do with your content.

Each user has an assigned role in the site - Manager, Collaborator, Contributor, or Consumer - and each role has a default set of permissions. This controls the actions site members can [perform in a site](../references/permissions_share.md).

The Manage Permissions feature goes beyond the site permissions. It lets you override a user's site role for a particular content item or folder. This means you can give a site member either more or less access to specific content compared to what they can do with other content in the library.

This can be really useful to hide and restrict content to only a set group of site members.

CAUTION:

Don't give permissions to users who aren't a member of the site, as this can cause problems with the document library.

1.  Locate and view the folder or content item whose permissions you want to manage.

2.  On the details page click **Manage Permissions**.

    The Manage Permissions for \[name\] dialog box appears. A button to the right of each group displays the current permissions.

3.  For each group whose permissions you want to change, click the button to the right of the group and select the desired permission from the list displayed.

    Selecting **No privileges** blocks the users with that defined role from having any access to the currently selected content. The content will not even appear in the library to these users. Note that Site Managers always have full privileges within a site.

    **Note:** To return to the default permission settings click **Use Defaults**. This closes the dialog box and resets the permissions.

4.  Click **Save**.


The dialog box closes and the group permissions are set as defined for the specified library content.
