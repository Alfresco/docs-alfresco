# Checking out an item to Google Docs

To edit an item in Google Docs you must check it out. This locks the original item in the library to prevent other users from editing it outside Google Docs while you are working with it.

This task assumes you are in the library of the desired site and that the item you want to work with has the *Google Docs Editable* aspect. This aspect is added manually using the Manage Aspects action; it is added automatically when you create a Google Docs item.

1.  Navigate the library’s folder structure to locate the content item you want to edit.

2.  Position the cursor over the item of interest in the item list to display the available actions.

3.  Click **More** and then **Check Out to Google Docs**.

    This action is also available on the details page.


A working copy of the item is placed in the **I’m Editing** view with your other working copies. A note above the item indicates that it is available for editing in Google Docs. A link, *Google Docs*, is provided for opening the related content item in that application.

CAUTION:

If the note indicates that the item is locked for offline editing and the Google Docs link is not provided, contact your system administrator. This message indicates that the Google Docs functionality is not enabled and you will be unable to locate the document you have just checked out. To remove the lock and return the item to the library, click **Cancel Editing**.

An icon indicates that the file is being edited by you.

This item, which is now available for viewing and editing in Google Docs, is shared with all site members who have the appropriate read/write privileges.
