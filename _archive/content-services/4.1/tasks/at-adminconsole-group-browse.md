# Browsing the user groups

The Groups page contains a multi-paned panel that lets you navigate the hierarchy of user groups.

1.  Open the Admin Console, and then click **Groups**.

2.  On the Groups page, click **Browse**.

    The left most pane displays all user groups.

3.  To view all groups, including the system groups, select the **Show System Groups** checkbox, and then click **Browse**.

    System groups are created in the background, for example, when you create a site. You can show these groups so that you can edit the **Display Name**, add users, or delete the group.

4.  Click a group to display its contents in the panel directly to the right.

    The content can be subgroups and/or individual users. The counter in the footer of the groups table indicates the number of pages within this column.

5.  Browse through the group structure.

    You see a navigation path displayed at the top of the panel indicating your selections stemming from the initial pane.

6.  Click any link in this path to step back to that selection.

7.  Browse a different group by clicking the first link in the navigation path to return to the top-level groups, and then select a new group.
