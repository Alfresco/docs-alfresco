# RSS Feed dashlets

There are two RSS feed dashlets that you can choose to include on your personal dashboard: RSS Feed and Alfresco Add-ons RSS Feed. On both dashlets you can edit the default URL to display any RSS feed.

You configure these dashlets in the same way:

1.  Click the **Configure** icon on the dashlet title.

2.  Specify the feed you want to subscribe to.

3.  Select the number of items to display on the dashlet for the specified feed.

4.  Select **Open links in new window** to have the target story display in a new window.

5.  Click **OK**.
