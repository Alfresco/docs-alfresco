# Importing content

Importing an Alfresco Content Package \(ACP\) into a Records Management system expands the package to its original structure. Existing content will not be overwritten.

1.  Navigate to the File Plan and select the container where you want to import the ACP.

2.  Click **Import**.

3.  Click the **Select file\(s\) to upload** button.

4.  Locate the file on your computer that you want to import and click **Open**.

    **Important:** Only import an ACP file that was generated from another Records Management File Plan using the **Export All** action.

    The selected file appears in the Import dialog box. Click **Remove** to delete it, if necessary.

5.  Click **Upload File\(s\)**.

    An indicator informs you of the upload progress. When 100% displays for the file, you can proceed.

6.  Click **OK**.
