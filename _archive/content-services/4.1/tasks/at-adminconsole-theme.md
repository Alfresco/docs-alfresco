# Changing the look and feel theme

The look and feel of the user interface is set by a theme. The Application tool lets you select a color scheme for the user interface.

1.  Open the Admin Console, and then click Application.

2.  On the Options page, select a theme from the list.

    Choose one of the available themes:

    -   **Green Theme**
    -   **Default Blue Theme**
    -   **Yellow Theme**
    -   **Google Docs Theme**
    -   **High Contrast Theme**
3.  Click **Apply**.


The page refreshes to display with the selected theme. The changed theme affects all users from the next time they login and persists across sessions.

A new installation uses the default theme, which comprises the CSS and image assets used across all pages.

**Note:** Site managers can customize the theme for an individual site. If a site theme has been changed, this will override any theme setting made in the Admin Console.
