# Setting up Enterprise to Cloud Sync

The Enterprise to Cloud Sync feature lets you synchronize the content in Alfresco Enterprise to your Alfresco in the cloud account. You set up this synchronization in your user profile. You must have an Alfresco in the cloud account to use this feature.

1.  Expand the user menu on the toolbar and click **My Profile**.

2.  Click **Cloud Sync** to display that page.

3.  Click **Sign in to Alfresco in the cloud**.

4.  Provide your login credentials \(email address and password\) for Alfresco in the cloud and click **Connect**.

    **Note:** If you don't have an Alfresco in the cloud account, click No Account? Sign up for free on the dialog box.

    Alfresco validates your credentials and connects you to the cloud. You can disconnect at any time. If you change your password to Alfresco in the cloud, edit your login details here to make sure you maintain your connection between Enterprise and the cloud.
