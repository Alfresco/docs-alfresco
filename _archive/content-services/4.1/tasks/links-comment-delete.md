# Deleting a link comment

Delete a comment to permanently remove it from a link.

This task assumes you are viewing the links for the desired site.

Only a Site Manager and the user who created the comment can delete it.

1.  Locate and view the link containing the comment you want to delete.

    The detail view displays the selected link along with any related comments.

2.  Position your cursor over the comment you want to delete to display the available actions and then click the **Delete Comment**action.

    This action is available only when the currently logged in user has permission to delete the comment.

    A message prompts you to confirm the deletion.

3.  Click **Delete**.

    The comment is removed from the page.

4.  Click **Links List** to return to the main view.
