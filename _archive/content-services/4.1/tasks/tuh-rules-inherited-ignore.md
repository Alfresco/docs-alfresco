# Ignoring inherited rules

If a space has inherited rules from the space in which it is contained, you can ignore those inherited rules in that sub space.

1.  Navigate to the space whose content rules you want to manage.

    The space header displays the name and details of the space.

2.  In the **More Actions**menu, click **Manage Content Rules**.

3.  In the **More Actions**menu of the Content Rules page, click **Ignore Inherited Rules**.

4.  Click **Close** to return to the current space.
