# Customizing a site dashboard

The site dashboard is an interactive user interface that contains information specific to the current site. Like your personal dashboard, site information is organized and displayed in dashlets.

You should customize the site itself before customizing the site dashboard.

For each site you can:

-   modify the dashboard appearance
-   select the dashlets you want to include on the dashboard
-   configure the display order of the selected dashlets

The Site Activities dashlet has filters that let you customize the activities it displays. You may find it useful to add more than one of this dashlet and then, on the dashboard, configure each instance to show different information.

You must have the role Site Manager to perform this task.

1.  Navigate to the site whose dashboard you want to configure.

2.  Click **Customize Dashboard** on the dashboard banner.

    The Customize Site Dashboard page displays. The image in the Current Layout section indicates the currently selected layout. The Dashlets section displays the currently selected dashlets as they will appear on the site dashboard.

3.  Change the site dashboard layout:

    1.  Click **Change Layout** to display the available dashboard layouts.

    2.  Click the graphic of the desired layout or click **Select** to the right of it.

4.  Select the site dashlets:

    1.  Click **Add Dashlets** to display the available dashlets.

    2.  To add a dashlet, click an item in the Add Dashlets section and drag it to the desired column.

        **Tip:** Select the site dashlets carefully: some dashlets are directly tied to site components. As an example, the Wiki dashlet displays a page from the site wiki. Therefore, if you have not configured the site to include a wiki, then there is no reason to add the Wiki dashlet to the dashboard.

    3.  To remove a dashlet, click the unwanted dashlet and either drag it to the garbage can or press DELETE.

5.  Click and drag the dashlets within and across columns to configure the display order.

6.  Click **OK** to save your changes.


You return to the site dashboard displaying the selected dashlets in the order configured.
