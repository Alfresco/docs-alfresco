# Filing a non-electronic record

Non-electronic records may be paper files or papers that can be stored in a physical location. The non-electronic record in Alfresco Records Management provides a record of the existence of the file and the details of where it is physically stored.

This task assumes that you are in a record folder and you have chosen to upload a non-electronic record. The Non-electronic Record dialog box displays.

1.  Enter details for the file you are making a record of.

    Only the Name and Title are required. Provide enough information to ensure this record will be recognized by other users.

2.  Click **Save**.

    The new record displays in the File Plan as an undeclared record.
