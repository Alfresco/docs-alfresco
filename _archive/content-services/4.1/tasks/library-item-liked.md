# Liking library content

Use the **Like** action to respond positively to library content without going to the trouble of writing a specific comment.

This task assumes you are in the library of the desired site. To perform this task on a folder the **Show Folders** feature must be enabled.

You can like any content in the library—items and folders. You can like an item in the item list \(detailed view only—this feature does not appear in the simple view\) or on the details page. You can like a folder only in the detailed view of the item list.

All new folders and items display a thumbs-up outline icon to the left of the action: ![](../images/at-like_no.png). A solid thumbs-up icon indicates that you have liked the content: ![](../images/at-like_yes.png). The number to the right of the icon shows you how many users like the content.

Though you can browse the library to find an item to like, it's more likely that you'll choose to like content as you come across or work with it. In this case the first two steps will not apply.

1.  Ensure the item list is displayed in the detailed view.

2.  Browse the library to locate the folder or item you want to like.

3.  Click the thumbs-up outline icon or the **Like** action of the folder or item you want to like.

    **Note:** If you are liking a content item, consider previewing it first to ensure it is the correct one. You can like the item on the details page.

    The icon changes, the **Like** action is removed, and the counter increases by one.

4.  In the item list select **Popularity** as the sort criteria to reorder the current view with the most liked content \(folders first and then items\) at the top.

    **Tip:** Simply click the thumbs-up icon to unlike the content.
