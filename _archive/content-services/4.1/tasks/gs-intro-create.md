# Creating site content

Having already created the site wiki, you're now going to add some content to it to make it an introduction on your site dashboard.

1.  Click **Wiki** to open the Wiki page component.

2.  Click **New Page** and type *Welcome to the marketing content collaboration site* as the title.

3.  Add the following in the text area. *This site is used to share marketing assets both internally and with our external consultants. By using this site as a unified library and meeting place, we can collaborate and share our content, whilst keeping control over changes, updates and versioning.*

    **Note:** You can see that you have all the standard word processing features available to you to create really visual content. You can keep it simple here, but in future you can format text, add links, images and even smiley's!

4.  Type *collaboration* in the Tags field and click **Add**.

    **Note:** You can add as many tags as you like to wiki pages - use these tags to keep control of your content by applying appropriate tags to all your wiki pages.

5.  Click **Save** and the page you just created is displayed. There's also the option to add more new pages here if you want to.

6.  Click **Wiki Page List** and you can see an overview of your page, including the tags.

    From this page list you can easily find content on your wiki. For now though, click **Site Dashboard** so that we can go and add this wiki page as a site introduction.


This video shows the steps in the tutorial.
