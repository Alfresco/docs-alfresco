# Changing the role of a site member or site group

At any time a site manager can change the role assigned to an individual site member or site group.

This task assumes you are in the Members component of the desired site.

1.  Beneath the banner select **People** or **Groups** to display the appropriate search page.

2.  Locate the site member or group whose role you want to change for the current site.

    The page displays the search results. A button to the right of the member/group name indicates the assigned role.

3.  Click the button displaying the currently assigned role.

    A list displays the available roles: **Manager**, **Collaborator**, **Contributor**, and **Consumer**.

4.  Click the appropriate role for the site member.
