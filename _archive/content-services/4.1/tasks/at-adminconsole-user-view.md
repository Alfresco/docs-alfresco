# Searching for and viewing a user account

The User Search feature lets you locate any user and view that user's account information.

1.  Open the Admin Console, and then click **Users**.

    You see the User Search page.

2.  In the search box, enter the full or partial name of the user.

    The search is not case sensitive.

3.  Click **Search**.

    In the results table, you can click the column headings to sort the results.

    In the first column, a green dot indicates the user account is currently enabled; a red dot indicates the account is disabled.

4.  Click the name of a user to show the related user profile and account details.


You see the User Profile page. From here you can edit or delete the user account.
