# Enterprise to Cloud Sync Logical overview

This topic gives a high level description of the architecture of the Enterprise to Cloud Sync feature.

Alfresco on the cloud has various Networks within it and every Network in turn includes users. These users can send cloud invitations to each other and interact with each other, thereby sharing content and information.

The Enterprise to Cloud feature allows Enterprise Alfresco \(on-premise\) users to synchronize content between their local Enterprise Alfresco and a Network on Alfresco Cloud, thereby providing access to other Alfresco Cloud users. The following diagram describes this flow.
