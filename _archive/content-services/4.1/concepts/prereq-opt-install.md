# Installing software required for Alfresco

This section describes how to install the software requirements that integrate with Alfresco. Some of the software can be installed any time before or after installing Alfresco.

-   **[Installing OpenOffice](../tasks/oo-install.md)**  
Within Alfresco, you can transform a document from one format to another, for example, a text file to a PDF file. To have access to these transformation facilities in Alfresco, you must install OpenOffice. This is optional, and can be done any time after Alfresco is installed.
-   **[Installing ImageMagick](../tasks/imagemagick-config.md)**  
To enable image manipulation in Alfresco, you must install and configure ImageMagick. Alfresco uses ImageMagick to manipulate images for previewing.
-   **[Installing Ghostscript](../tasks/Ghostscript-install.md)**  
Alfresco Share uses Ghostscript version 8.56 for creating document thumbnails and previews. This topic describes how to install Ghostscript on your system.
-   **[Installing Flash Player](../tasks/flash-install.md)**  
This is optional and may be installed after you have installed Alfresco. Alfresco Share uses the Flash Player for viewing Flash previews and also when you use the multi-file upload facility.
-   **[Installing SWF Tools](../concepts/swftool-intro.md)**  
Alfresco Share uses the pdf2swf utility of the SWF Tools for previewing PDF files. The pdf2swf utility generates one frame per page of fully formatted text inside a Flash movie. To install the pdf2swf utility, you must install the complete SWF Tools.

Alfresco is localized using the language packs supplied in the default install. Alfresco supports the following language packs: German \(de\), English \(en\), Spanish \(es\), French \(fr\), Italian \(it\), Japanese \(ja\), Dutch \(nl\), and Russian \(ru\).
-   **[Installing an Alfresco Module Package](../tasks/amp-install.md)**  
An Alfresco Module Package \(AMP\) is a bundle of code, content model, content, and the directory structure that is used to distribute additional functionality for Alfresco. Use the Module Management Tool \(MMT\) to install and manage AMP files. This section describes how to install an AMP in an Alfresco WAR using the MMT.
