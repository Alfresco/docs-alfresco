# Working with content

Before you begin working with content in Alfresco, you'll look at the two different concepts of content there are in Alfresco.

The first is content that is actually part of Alfresco page components themselves, for example, updates to a wiki, new blog posts, or forum discussions.

The second is content items such as documents, spreadsheets, or images that are stored in the content library. These can be uploaded or created directly from Alfresco, but are a content item rather than content created within a page component.

So now that you know the differences in content types, it's time to start adding content to our site.

-   **[Adding content items](../tasks/gs-content-add.md)**  
First you'll look at adding content items such as documents, spreadsheets, presentations, and images to a site.
-   **[Updating content](../tasks/gs-content-update.md)**  
Updating your content in Alfresco is really easy to do and you can even select whether to edit online or offline.
-   **[Creating site content](../tasks/gs-intro-create.md)**  
Having already created the site wiki, you're now going to add some content to it to make it an introduction on your site dashboard.
-   **[Making content visible](../tasks/gs-intro-add.md)**  
Having set up your wiki, the next step is to show this content to users on the site dashboard.
