# Alfresco One Getting Started summary

That brings us to the end of the Alfresco Getting Started guide, and you should now be able to use Alfresco in ways that will improve how you work on a day to day basis.

You've learnt how to:

-   Customize your own Alfresco dashboard and user profile
-   Create a site where your team can share content and collaborate
-   Work with different kinds of content and add it to your site
-   Invite users to your site, set up meetings, and use social media-style features
-   View and understand site activities
-   Share content on the cloud with external collaborators

This is just the beginnings of what you can achieve with Alfresco; we'd really recommend that you take some time to look at our other learning resources and try out other features that will help you:

-   Read the [\(Using Alfresco\)](master-using-intro.md) documentation on other features
-   Watch the Alfresco 'How To' videos [\('How To' videos\)](../topics/alfresco-video-tutorials.md)
-   Explore [Alfresco Cloud](http://docs.alfresco.com/cloud/topic/com.alfresco.cloud.doc/concepts/welcome-infocenter-cloud.html)
-   Use other site components such as discussion forums[\(Discussion forums\)](discussions-intro.md), blogs[\(Blogs\)](blog-intro.md), and data lists [\(Data lists\)](datalists-intro.md)
