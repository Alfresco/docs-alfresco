# Google Docs upload and create formats

Google Docs restricts the formats of files or documents that can be uploaded or created.

The following table shows the file format restrictions for content that integrates with Google Docs.

|File extension|MIME type|
|--------------|---------|
|DOC|application/msword|
|XLS|application/vnd.ms-excel|
|PPT|application/ppt|

Google Docs integration supports only Office 2003 formats.

When you upload a supported MIME type, you'll be able to apply the *Google Docs Editable* aspect to the content, and then it can be checked out to Google Docs.Â For all unsupported MIME types, the *Google Docs Editable* aspect will not be available.
