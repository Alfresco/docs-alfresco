# Using the site dashlets

Once you navigate to a site dashboard you can view information and perform functions on the dashlets just as you do on your personal dashboard.

Where a user name or piece of content appears as a link in a dashlet, you can click it to navigate to the associated page.

Each dashlet includes help text that explains the information presented and how the dashlet can be used. Position your cursor in the dashlet header to reveal the help button, then click it to display the related text. The help remains open until you close it or navigate away from the dashboard.

The topics in this section provide details on using the site dashlets.

**Note:** The RSS Feed, Alfresco Add-ons RSS Feed, and Web View site dashlets on the site dashboard are identical to those on your personal dashboard. See the related tasks.
