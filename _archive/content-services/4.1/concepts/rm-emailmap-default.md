# Default email mappings

The Email Mappings page shows a list of the current maps between email headers and Alfresco properties.

For example, the email Subject heading mapping to the property title is shown as: `messageSubject` to `cm:title`.

The email header field `messageSubject` is on the left and is separated by the word “to”, which indicates that it is mapped to a property `cm:title`.
