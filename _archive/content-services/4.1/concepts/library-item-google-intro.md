# Editing content in Google Docs

Library items that have the aspect *Google Docs Editable* can be edited offline in Google Docs.

This aspect is applied automatically to library items created using a Google Docs option in the Create Content menu. The aspect can also be added manually.

The process for editing content in Google Docs involves three steps:

-   Check out the library item
-   View and edit the item in Google Docs
-   Check in the content to upload your changes

-   **[Checking out an item to Google Docs](../tasks/library-item-google-checkout.md)**  
To edit an item in Google Docs you must check it out. This locks the original item in the library to prevent other users from editing it outside Google Docs while you are working with it.
-   **[Accessing a library item in Google Docs](../tasks/library-item-google-access.md)**  
When a library item is checked out to Google Docs you can access it for viewing and editing. You can do this from within the library.
-   **[Checking in an item from Google Docs](../tasks/library-item-google-checkin.md)**  
Once you finish editing content in Google Docs you must check it back into the library to upload the changes. This releases the lock on the library item making it available to other users for editing.
