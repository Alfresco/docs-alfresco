# Programming with Alfresco

Alfresco provides several application programming interfaces \(APIs\) to let you integrate access to Alfresco repositories into your applications.

-   **[Integrating your application with Alfresco](../concepts/integration-options.md)**  
 Alfresco provides many programmatic ways to access the content management capabilities of the system to support applications that need access to content services. Because Alfresco supports a number of standards-based protocols; applications and application development environments can use existing tools to access, update, and search Alfresco content.
-   **[Designing your application](../concepts/alfresco-considerations.md)**  
While Alfresco can scale from small solutions to an enterprise-wide infrastructure, you must consider how to configure Alfresco and which tools and interfaces to use to develop your content application.
-   **[Programming with CMIS](../concepts/cmis-about.md)**  
Content Management Interoperability Services \(CMIS\) is an OASIS standard designed for the ECM industry. CMIS enables access to any content management systems that implement CMIS, such as Microsoft SharePoint, IBM FileNet, EMC Documentum, and Alfresco in a standardized and interoperable way.
-   **[Programming with the repository](../reuse/gge-hdg-alfrescodevelopment.md)**  
Here are some guidelines and examples for developing against Alfresco repositories.
-   **[Programming with Alfresco services](../concepts/serv-using-about.md)**  
 Services are core to the Alfresco content application server and are used by all applications working against the server. These applications include the Alfresco Explorer and Alfresco Share clients, Virtual File System interfaces such as CIFS, WebDAV, and APIs.
-   **[Programming with Surf](../concepts/surf-fwork-intro.md)**  
Surf lets you build user interfaces for web applications using server-side scripts and templates without Java coding, recompilation, or server restarts. Surf follows a content-driven approach, where scripts and templates are simple files on disk so that you can make changes to a live site in a text editor.
-   **[Web Scripts](../concepts/ws-architecture.md)**  
Alfresco web scripts provide a unique way to programmatically interact with the Alfresco content application server. Unlike other interfaces exposed by Alfresco, web scripts offer a RESTful API for the content residing in the content repository. The REST \(Representational State Transfer\) web architecture is based on HTTP requests and responses, URIs \(Uniform Resource Identifiers\), and document types.
-   **[Alfresco API Reference](../concepts/API-intro-4.md)**  
 This reference describes the publicly available and supported APIs \(Application Programming Interfaces\) that enable developers to write applications that access Alfresco.
