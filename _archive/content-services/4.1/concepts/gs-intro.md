For most of us, today's work environment means we spend much of our time working in teams that can extend beyond our workplace, and even our enterprise, to include partners, consultants, external agencies, and customers. To collaborate effectively, you need tools to facilitate communication, share information, and run projects. Alfresco provides these tools.
