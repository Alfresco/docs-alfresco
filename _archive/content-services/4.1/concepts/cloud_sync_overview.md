# Enterprise to Cloud Sync overview

This topic provides an overview of Enterprise to Cloud Sync.

Enterprise to Cloud Sync allows Alfresco Share on-premise users to synchronize content on to the Alfresco Cloud. Once content has been setup to synchronize, the cloud and on-premise instances of the documents are automatically synchronized with each other whenever either version is updated. This allows the on-premise Alfresco instance to act as the system of record and the cloud instance provides a system of engagement for external collaboration without requiring access to the on-premise system by 3rd parties. To set up Enterprise to Cloud Sync, you need an Alfresco Cloud account.
