# Understanding working copies

When you check out a content item for editing, Alfresco creates a working copy for you to work with.

The working copy provides an easy way to make changes to content, online or offline, and review and update the changes before replacing the original content.

Checking out a content item locks the original item. Roll your mouse over the lock icon associated with a content item to see who checked it out. The icon ![Locked by You](../images/im-lockedbyuser.png) indicates it is checked out by you and ![Locked by Other](../images/im-lockedbyother.png) indicates it is checked out by another user.

Users can view both the original version and the working copy of a content item. The working copy remains the same as the original unless you upload your changes. You can update the working copy to allow others to see your changes without updating the original content.

Once you complete your edits, you must check in the working copy to update the original content item.
