# Getting started

Take some time to become familiar with the user interface.

This introductory section explains basic concepts, such as dashboards and sites, and includes tasks on customizing your personal dashboard and setting up your user profile. You need to perform these setup tasks only once but you can revisit them at any time to update, edit, or reconfigure your environment.

-   **[Finding your way around](../concepts/ui-description.md)**  
When you enter the application your personal dashboard is displayed. This is an interactive user interface that lets you know what is going on in the sites that you belong to. You can customize the information that appears on this page.
