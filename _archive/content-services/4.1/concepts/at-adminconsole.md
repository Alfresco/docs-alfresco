# Managing Alfresco using the Admin Console

The Admin Console is a browser-based console that lets you manage your administration operations.

In the Admin Console, you can manage users, groups, email, file systems, and transformer availability. You can also view information about the repository and server, and statistics \(like the number of users/groups, storage used, and so on\). You can also manage archived documents.

The Admin Console is visible only if you are an Administrator user or a user who is a member of the `ALFRESCO_ADMINISTRATORS` group.

**Note:** If you have a clustered environment in which each node in the cluster needs a unique configuration, then the configuration values for each node must be set via the properties file, and not via Share admin console or JMX.
