# Working with content

Content items are added to or created in spaces within the Alfresco repository.

You can view and work with content items within the spaces themselves or on your own hard drive. There is no limit to the type or number of content items that can be stored in Alfresco.

-   **[Adding content to spaces](../concepts/cuh-content-add-intro.md)**  
You can add content items to Alfresco spaces in several ways.
-   **[Viewing content](../tasks/tuh-content-view.md)**  
View a content item directly in Alfresco without needing to download or check out a copy to your hard drive.
-   **[Editing content](../concepts/cuh-content-edit.md)**  
There are two options available for editing documents: **Edit Online** and **Edit Offline**.
-   **[Adding versioning to content](../tasks/tuh-content-version.md)**  
Enable versioning for a content item to track the revisions made to that item.
-   **[Downloading content to your computer](../tasks/tuh-content-download.md)**  
Download a content item from the repository to save a copy to your computer without checking it out.
-   **[Updating content](../tasks/tuh-content-update.md)**  
The **Upload New Version** function enables you to update a content item in the repository with content from your computer.
-   **[Approving and rejecting a content item](../tasks/tuh-workflow-approvereject.md)**  
If a content item is part of a simple workflow – that is, it resides in a space for which simple content review workflow has been defined – you can approve it. The approve action may be followed in the action list by a rejection action.
-   **[Understanding working copies](../concepts/cuh-content-workingcopy.md)**  
When you check out a content item for editing, Alfresco creates a working copy for you to work with.
-   **[Discussing content](../tasks/tuh-content-discuss.md)**  
When developing a piece of content in collaboration with other colleagues, you can discuss specific objects with selected colleagues.
-   **[Exporting and importing content](../concepts/cuh-content-exportimport.md)**  
Exporting and importing content allows you to copy a space and its contents from one location within Alfresco to another or from one Alfresco repository to another.
-   **[Inviting users to a content item for collaboration](../tasks/tuh-content-inviteuser.md)**  
To collaborate with others on a specific content item, you must invite them to that content and define the roles they will play. When you do this, you are setting permissions for the content item.
-   **[Taking ownership of content](../tasks/tuh-content-ownership.md)**  
You can take ownership of content from someone else.
-   **[Using multilingual content](../tasks/tuh-content-multilingual.md)**  
Alfresco enables you to store translated versions of content against the native language content item, so the relationship is always maintained. It controls these translations with versioning and other content services.
-   **[Viewing content item details](../concepts/cuh-content-details-view.md)**  
In any space, you can choose to view either the basic details or the full details for a content item.
-   **[Editing content item details](../tasks/tuh-content-details-edit.md)**  
When viewing content item details, you can modify some of the information presented.
