# Managing your Alfresco license

Your access and use of Alfresco is managed by a license. The license sets the maximum number of users and a maximum number of content objects that you can use. The license is not tied to specific servers, for example, by IP or MAC address.

You need to purchase and upload licenses appropriate to the number of users, content objects, and your support requirements.

-   **[Viewing your license details](../tasks/at-adminconsole-license-viewdetails.md)**  
The License Descriptor page shows the details of your license. Use this page to check your license restrictions and use.
-   **[Uploading a new license](../tasks/at-adminconsole-license.md)**  
When you first run Alfresco, it defaults to using a 30-day trial license. This section describes how to upload your own Alfresco Enterprise license file. The license file sets the capabilities of your Alfresco system.
