# Using Alfresco

The tasks in this section relate to the Alfresco Document Management \(DM\) features, enabling you to manage and collaborate on content contained in the repository.

-   **[Working with spaces](../concepts/cuh-spaces.md)**  
In Alfresco, a space is a container for storing and organizing content and other spaces so that you can quickly and easily locate or return to them again.
-   **[Working with content](../concepts/cuh-content.md)**  
Content items are added to or created in spaces within the Alfresco repository.
-   **[Using categories](../concepts/cuh-categories.md)**  
Categories allow you to quickly and easily organize your content to help you retrieve the content you are looking for.
-   **[Working with smart spaces and content rules](../concepts/cuh-smartspaces.md)**  
One of the key benefits of Alfresco is the ability to define rules that affect content within a space. A space with one or more defined content rules is called a *smart space*.
-   **[Working with workflows](../concepts/cuh-workflow-intro.md)**  
A workflow is a work procedure and workflow steps represent the activities users must follow in order to achieve the desired outcome. Alfresco provides two different types of workflow: simple and advanced.
-   **[Working with forum spaces](../concepts/cuh-forum.md)**  
A forum space is a place for holding discussions with other users.
-   **[Managing multilingual content](../tasks/tuh-multilingual.md)**  
You can work with a view of all the multilingual aspects of content to manage its translations.
