# Records Management functions

The Records Management banner displays functions that relate to the storage and retrieval of records.

The main functions on the banner are:

-   **File Plan**

    *File Plan* is the container for the record hierarchy. It is like a virtual filing cabinet for storing records. The site manager sets this up to reflect your business needs.

-   **Records Search**

    *Records Search* allows you to search the records in the Alfresco repository. You can create specific searches and save them to the **Saved Search** area.

-   **Members**

    *Members* allows you to manage the users and groups in the Records Management site.
