# Adding content to the library

You can add existing content from outside the application and create new content within the site in order to populate the document library.

The **Upload** action enables you to upload existing content from your computer into the library.

The **Create Content** menu provides options for creating plain text, HTML, and XML documents directly in the library.

It also enables you to create three different types of Google Docs content items: documents, spreadsheets, and presentations.

For both methods, it is important to understand how to create a folder structure within the library to organize the new content items.

-   **[Adding items to the library](../tasks/library-add-content.md)**  
Adding content items from your computer to the site library is a simple process. You can upload individual files or several files at a time.
-   **[Creating content in the library](../tasks/library-create-content.md)**  
The **Create Content** feature enables you to create plain text, HTML, XML, and Google Docs files directly in the site library. You can also create content from templates.
