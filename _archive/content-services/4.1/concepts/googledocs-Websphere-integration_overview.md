# Enabling Google Docs with WebSphere

The steps for enabling Google Docs for an instance of Alfresco running on WebSphere vary depending on which search engine is in use: Solr or Lucene.

If you initially enable Solr on Alfresco and then switch to Lucene, you will already have **AlfrescoTrustStore** in the certificates. To enable Google Docs in this scenario, use the instructions for Google Docs with Alfresco \(Solr enabled\).
