# Using Alfresco outside of the Alfresco interface

You can work with files in Alfresco without actually being in the Alfresco interface. You may not even know that you are working with Alfresco!

Your administrator can map the Alfresco repository so that you can access your Alfresco content using Windows Explorer or a desktop shortcut. If you are working in this way, then there will be up to 4 additional files shown on each level of the Alfresco structure:

-   \_\_Alfresco.url
-   \_\_CheckInOut.exe
-   \_\_ShowDetails.exe
-   \_\_Share.url

You can use these files to add content to the Alfresco repository, check documents in and out, view document details, and open Alfresco in a browser window.

**Note:** These options only function when you are working in a Windows environment.

-   **[Add a file to Alfresco from outside the Alfresco interface](../tasks/cifs-add-file-outside-alfresco.md)**  
 You can easily drag and drop content to the repository from outside the Alfresco interface.
-   **[Check out files from outside Alfresco](../tasks/cifs-using-checkinout-exe.md)**  
 You can use the CheckInOut.exe to check content out so that you can work on it securely.
-   **[View item details from a mapped drive](../tasks/cifs-usingshowdetails-exe.md)**  
 You can use the ShowDetails.exe to view item details and properties.
-   **[Open Alfresco in a browser window](../tasks/cifs-using-alfresco-url.md)**  
 You can use the Alfresco.url to open the Alfresco repository in a browser window.
-   **[Open Alfresco Share in a browser window](../tasks/cifs-using-share-exe.md)**  
 You can use the Share.url to open the Alfresco Share interface in a browser window.
