# Sharing content externally

Having set up your site and added content to it, you can now use the Enterprise to Cloud Sync feature to collaborate with your external partners.

In this scenario you will sync your marketing content to the cloud. Your marketing consultants will be able to edit it without having access to your on-premise network, whilst you maintain visibility of their edits. Once the updates are complete you will unsync the updated content from the cloud.

-   **[Linking your site to the cloud](../tasks/gs-sync-link.md)**  
You can create a link from your Enterprise site to your cloud account to enable cloud-sync.
-   **[Sharing your content on the cloud](../tasks/gs-sync-sync.md)**  
 You can now sync your content to the cloud, so that your external consultants can make updates to it.
-   **[Removing your content from the cloud](../tasks/gs-sync-unsync.md)**  
 When your external collaborators have completed their work on your content, you can remove the content from the cloud.
