# Enabling YouTube with WebSphere

The steps for enabling YouTube for an instance of Alfresco running on WebSphere vary depending on which search engine is in use: Solr or Lucene.

If you initially enable Solr on Alfresco and then switch to Lucene, you will already have **AlfrescoTrustStore** in the certificates. To enable YouTube in this scenario, use the instructions for YouTube with Alfresco \(Solr enabled\).

In an Alfresco environment deployed on WebSphere and with the Lucene search engine enabled, to enable the publish to YouTube feature requires additional steps.
