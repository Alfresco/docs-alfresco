# Authentication chain functions

The functions of the chain are composed in two different ways: chained functions and pass-through functions.

-   **[Chained functions](../concepts/auth-chain-chained.md)**  
Chained functions combine together functions of more than one subsystem.
-   **[Pass-through functions](../concepts/auth-chain-passthrough.md)**  
Pass-through functions cannot be chained and instead pass through to a single member of the chain, which handles them directly.

**Parent topic:**[Authentication subsystems](../concepts/auth-subsystem-intro.md)
