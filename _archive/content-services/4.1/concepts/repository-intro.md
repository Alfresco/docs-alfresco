# Repository

The **Repository** feature displays the contents of the Alfresco Explorer repository within the framework of a site library.

**Note:** If the **Repository** feature on the toolbar is not available contact your system administrator.

This view of the repository includes all of the usual library actions with the exception of **Edit Offline**.

Just as in a site library, the browsing pane provides navigation and filtering options. This lets you filter the repository contents by category or tag, or you can browse the repository file structure. You can also choose to view the content items currently checked out to you \(**I'm Editing** view\) or those that you have specifically flagged as favorites \(**My Favorites** view\).

The functionality available within the Repository library, with the exception of Permissions, is identical to what you find in a site library. Refer to the library topics for details on performing specific actions within the Repository library.

-   **[Managing permissions in the Repository library](../tasks/repository-manage-permissions.md)**  
Manage the permissions in the Repository library to control users' access to the content.
