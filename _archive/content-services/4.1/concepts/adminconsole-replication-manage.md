# Managing existing jobs

The Replication Jobs page of the Admin Console displays a list of all existing replication jobs. For each job in this list, you can perform any of the following actions to manage and maintain the jobs:

-   Edit a job
-   Manually run a job
-   Cancel a job
-   Delete a job

-   **[Editing a replication job](../tasks/adminconsole-replication-edit.md)**  
You can easily update existing replication jobs. In addition to changing the job details, you can use this feature to disable a job so that it will not be run.
-   **[Manually running a replication job](../tasks/adminconsole-replication-run.md)**  
The **Run Job** feature enables you to manually run a replication job. You can do this at any time. If a schedule is set for the job, it remains in place and will be run at the appropriate time.
-   **[Cancelling a replication job](../tasks/adminconsole-replication-cancel.md)**  
You can cancel a job that is currently running, regardless of whether it was started automatically \(that is, it is a scheduled job\) or manually.
-   **[Deleting a replication job](../tasks/adminconsole-replication-delete.md)**  
If you no longer need a replication job, you can delete it from the Jobs list. If there is a chance you might need the job again, you may prefer to edit the job and simply disable it.
