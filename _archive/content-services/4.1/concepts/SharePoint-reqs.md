# Prerequisites for using SharePoint Protocol

The SharePoint Protocol module lets you manage Alfresco content from within Microsoft office. To use SharePoint with Alfresco, you need to install an important update from Microsoft.

See the Microsoft Download Center [Software Update for Web Folders \(KB907306\)](https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/kb/907306) to download the update.

It is important to install this update, otherwise you will not be able to access the Alfresco content from within Microsoft Word.
