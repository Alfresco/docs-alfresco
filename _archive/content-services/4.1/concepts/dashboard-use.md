# Your personal dashboard

Once you log in you can view information and perform functions on the dashlets that sit on your personal dashboard.

Where a user name, site name, or piece of content appears as a link in a dashlet, you can click it to navigate to the associated page.

Each dashlet includes help text that explains the information presented and how the dashlet can be used. Position your cursor in the dashlet header to reveal the help button, then click it to display the related text. The help remains open until you close it or navigate away from the dashboard.

The topics in this section provide details on using the personal dashlets.
