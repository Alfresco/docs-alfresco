# Working with spaces

In Alfresco, a space is a container for storing and organizing content and other spaces so that you can quickly and easily locate or return to them again.

A smart space is a space that has rules defined for how the content entering, leaving, or currently residing in a space is managed.

-   **[Creating spaces](../concepts/cuh-spaces-create.md)**  
Spaces in Alfresco are used to store and organize content items and other spaces.
-   **[Customizing a space view](../concepts/cuh-spaces-customize.md)**  
Apply templates to your Alfresco spaces to customize your views. Before applying a template you can preview it to ensure it suits your needs. Once applied, it is easy to both change and remove the template.
-   **[Deleting a content space](../tasks/tuh-spaces-delete.md)**  
Delete a content space to permanently remove it, and its contents, from the repository.
-   **[Moving and copying a space](../tasks/tuh-spaces-movecopy.md)**  
You can move or copy a space, and its contents, from one location to another.
-   **[Inviting users to a space for collaboration](../tasks/tuh-spaces-inviteuser.md)**  
To collaborate with others on content, you must invite them to the space and define the roles they will play. When you do this, you are setting permissions for the space.
-   **[Emailing space users](../tasks/tuh-space-emailusers.md)**  
If you want to email users of a space to let them know about some changes to that space, you can do it from within the space itself.
-   **[Taking ownership of a space](../tasks/tuh-space-ownership.md)**  
You can take ownership of a space from someone else.
-   **[Running an action on a space](../tasks/tuh-space-runaction.md)**  
The **Run Action** feature enables you to run a one-off action on all content items in a space.
-   **[Viewing space details](../tasks/tuh-spaces-details-view.md)**  
In addition to viewing the contents of a space, you can view its details.
-   **[Editing space details](../tasks/tuh-spaces-details-edit.md)**  
In addition to viewing the space details, you can edit its properties and configuration.
