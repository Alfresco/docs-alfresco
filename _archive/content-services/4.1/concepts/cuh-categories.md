# Using categories

Categories allow you to quickly and easily organize your content to help you retrieve the content you are looking for.

You classify your content items in Alfresco with categories. The categories are organized into related groups to form a hierarchy. You can link a content item to more than one category.

Use the Categories feature in the sidebar to filter content items based on their category associations.

-   **[Viewing the categories linked to a content item](../tasks/tuh-category-view.md)**  
View the categories linked to the content item on the Details page.
-   **[Adding a category link to a content item](../tasks/tuh-category-add.md)**  
Link a content item to a category to classify that item.
-   **[Removing a category link from a content item](../tasks/tuh-category-remove.md)**  
If you no longer want a content item linked to a specific category, you can break the connection.
