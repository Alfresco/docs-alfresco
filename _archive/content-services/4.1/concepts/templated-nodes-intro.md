# Configuring templated nodes

Templated nodes allows for the storing of content templates in Alfresco repositories that users can then use to create content.

Templated nodes provide a convenient way for users to quickly create content based on a pre-determined style, such as documents already formatted to company guidelines. Once a template has been stored in the Alfresco repository users can create new content items based upon it from the **Create Content** menu in the **Document Library**.

You can have an unlimited number of templated nodes.

-   **[Setting files as templates](../tasks/templated-nodes-create.md)**  
In the Node Templates folder you can store documents that users can then use as document templates.
