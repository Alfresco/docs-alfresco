# Searching records

The Records Search functionality allows you to search the File Plan of the Records Management site. You can save your search query to use again in the site.

-   **[Accessing Records Search](../tasks/rm-search-access.md)**  
Accessing the records search lets you create a search query to locate and view a list of matching records.
-   **[Creating a search](../tasks/rm-search-create.md)**  
The search feature lets you locate content within the current site. You can narrow the results of your query by specifying relevant metadata fields and container types \(category, folder, record\). Once you create a search query, you can save it to use again.
-   **[Using a saved search](../tasks/rm-search-saved.md)**  
The Records Management site includes a number of default searches that you can use instead of creating your own. You also have access to searches you have created and saved yourself, as well as those created by other users.
-   **[Records Management search query syntax](../concepts/rm-search-syntax.md)**  
The syntax for Alfresco Records Management queries is based on the `fts-alfresco` Full Text Search \(FTS\) language, which is based on elements from the Lucene and SQL languages.
-   **[Search query examples](../concepts/rm-search-examples.md)**  
This section provides search examples and how to specify the query syntax.
-   **[Search fields](../concepts/rm-search-fields.md)**  
The following table shows the full list of Records Management fields available for searching records.
-   **[Search special record types](../concepts/rm-search-specialfields.md)**  
The following table shows the full list of Records Management special record types available for searching records.
-   **[Printing the search results](../tasks/rm-search-print.md)**  
You can print the search results.
-   **[Exporting the search results](../tasks/rm-search-export.md)**  
You can export the search results as an Alfresco Content Package \(ACP\).
-   **[Saving a search](../tasks/rm-search-save.md)**  
This task assumes that you are on the Search page, viewing the results of a search query on the Results tab.
-   **[Deleting a saved search](../tasks/rm-search-saved-delete.md)**  
You can delete any of your own saved searches. With correct permissions, you can also delete the default searches included with the Records Management site.
