# Working with content in a library

The site library lets you store and collaboratively manage the content related to a site, such as documents, media files, and graphics.

Site members can create and upload content for all site users to see and work on. Activities performed by site members display in the Site Content site dashlet.

-   **[Accessing the library](../tasks/library-access.md)**  
Access the site library to view and work with the content items in the current site.
-   **[Browsing the library content](../tasks/library-browse.md)**  
The browsing feature in the library lets you filter the content items so you can more easily locate the items you want to work with.
-   **[Creating a folder structure](../tasks/library-create-folder.md)**  
The **Library** section of the browsing pane displays the folder structure for the current site. A new site contains only the root folder, Documents. Add new folders beneath the root to create the site’s folder structure.
-   **[Adding content to the library](../concepts/library-add-content-intro.md)**  
You can add existing content from outside the application and create new content within the site in order to populate the document library.
-   **[Working with folders](../concepts/library-folder-intro.md)**  
Once the document library structure has been set up, site members can access and work with the folders that organize the library content. In the content item list, clicking a folder name or thumbnail displays the contents of that folder. From this list, site members can also choose to view the folder details and edit the properties defined for a folder.
-   **[Working with individual library items](../concepts/library-items-individual.md)**  
Once the document library is populated with content items, site members can access and work with individual items stored in the library. In addition to adding more content, members can view, download, edit, and delete content items.
-   **[Synchronizing content to Alfresco in the cloud](../tasks/sync-content.md)**  
The Enterprise to Cloud Sync feature lets you work with your content without you needing access to the on-premise Enterprise system. After you synchronize to the cloud, the on-premise and cloud instances of your content are automatically synchronized with each other whenever either version is updated. This relationship continues until you unsync the content.
-   **[Renaming library content](../tasks/library-item-rename.md)**  
You can easily rename library content — folders and items — in the item list. You can do this in both the detailed view and the simple view.
-   **[Tagging library content](../tasks/library-item-tag-inline.md)**  
You can conveniently create and manage the tags for a content item directly in the library item list. The inline tagging feature is available for both items and folders.
-   **[Specifying favorites](../tasks/library-item-favourites.md)**  
If there are folders and items in the library that you access often, mark them as favorites so that you can easily find them in the My Favorites view. Your favorite items will also be easy to locate on your personal dashboard: they display when you select the My Favorites filter on the My Documents dashlet.
-   **[Liking library content](../tasks/library-item-liked.md)**  
Use the **Like** action to respond positively to library content without going to the trouble of writing a specific comment.
-   **[Editing folder or item details](../tasks/library-item-edit-details.md)**  
Edit the basic details of a library folder or content item to rename it, edit its associated tags, and add or change the description. If the aspect *Classifiable* is configured for the selected folder or item, you also have the ability to edit the associated categories.
-   **[Editing folder or item properties](../tasks/library-item-edit-metadata.md)**  
From the details page you can edit the properties of the currently displayed folder or content item. The fields displayed on this page vary depending on how the properties have been customized and which aspects have been added.
-   **[Using comments](../concepts/library-comments.md)**  
Adding comments to folders and individual library items is a convenient way to provide site users with information or notes specific to that content. While all users with access to the site can view the comments, only site members can add comments. You can edit and delete any comments that you added.
-   **[Locating items and folders](../tasks/library-locate-content.md)**  
When you filter library content using one of the **Documents** or **Tags** browsing views, it is not possible to tell where an item or folder resides within the library folder structure. The **Locate File** and **Locate Folder** actions reveal the actual location of an item or folder in the library.
-   **[Copying content](../tasks/library-item-copy.md)**  
You can copy library content from its current location to another site or to any space in the Alfresco Explorer repository. The selected content, which can be an individual item or an entire folder, remains in its original location and a copy is placed at the location specified.
-   **[Moving content](../tasks/library-item-move.md)**  
Move content to relocate it to another location within the current site. You can also move content to a different site or to Alfresco Explorer.
-   **[Managing content permissions](../tasks/library-item-permissions.md)**  
You can override the default site permissions for any content you add to the document library. This lets you control what site members can see and do with your content.
-   **[Deleting content](../tasks/library-item-delete.md)**  
Delete content to permanently remove it from a site library. Deleting a folder removes both the folder and its contents from the library.
-   **[Working with replicated content](../concepts/replicated-content.md)**  
Content items and folders created as the result of a replication job display the icon **Transferred from another Repository** in the item list.
-   **[Working with multiple library items](../concepts/library-items-multiple.md)**  
There are several ways to select multiple items in the library. This allows you to efficiently perform a single task on multiple pieces of content at once.
