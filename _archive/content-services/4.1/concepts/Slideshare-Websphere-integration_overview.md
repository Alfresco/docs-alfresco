# Enabling SlideShare with WebSphere

The steps for enabling SlideShare for an instance of Alfresco running on WebSphere vary depending on which search engine is in use: Solr or Lucene. Using SlideShare, you can upload and share PowerPoint presentations, Word documents, and Adobe PDF Portfolios.

If you initially enable Solr on Alfresco and then switch to Lucene, you will already have **AlfrescoTrustStore** in the certificates. To enable SlideShare in this scenario, use the instructions for SlideShare with Alfresco \(Solr enabled\).
