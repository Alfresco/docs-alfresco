# Enterprise to Cloud Sync features

In addition to the standard cloud features, Enterprise to Cloud Sync has many special features, it allows automatic synchronization of content between on-premise Alfresco repositories and Alfresco's cloud service. This helps in bringing about ease of engagement and collaboration within the Enterprise and the Cloud. This topic describes some of the features and capabilities available within Enterprise to Cloud Sync.

Enterprise to Cloud Sync allows content to be sent to an Alfresco's cloud service and also provides the ability to automatically synchronize content between on-premise Alfresco repositories and Alfresco's cloud service, thereby keeping the on-premise system in sync with any changes. The Enterprise to Cloud Sync capabilities include:

-   Synchronization of individual and multiple files, folders, and folder hierarchies between on-premise and Alfresco Cloud.
-   Inclusion of content and common metadata within synchronized payloads
-   Automatic synchronization
-   Secure exchange of information over HTTPS connection
-   Initiation of all actions by the on-premise system. This makes the opening of a firewall redundant
-   Choice over what can be synchronized to ensure sensitive content remains on-premise
