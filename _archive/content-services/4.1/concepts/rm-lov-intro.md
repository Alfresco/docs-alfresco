# Creating a list of values

Throughout the Records Management system, there are metadata entry fields. The metadata can be simple text strings, Boolean values, or dates.

Where the value is a text string, you may also enter the value using a list of values menu. For example, on the Edit Metadata page, you enter the value for the Mimetype field by selecting a value from the menu.

There are two predefined lists in the Records Management installation that you can modify:

-   Supplemental Markings
-   Transfer Locations

Initially, these lists are empty. The administrator should populate these lists with appropriate values. You can also add your own lists of values.

-   **[Accessing the List of Values tool](../tasks/rm-lov-access.md)**  

-   **[Creating a list of values](../tasks/rm-lov-create.md)**  
Creating a list is a two step process. First you create the empty list and then you edit it to add the values. Once you create a list, you cannot delete it.
-   **[Editing a list of values](../tasks/rm-lov-edit.md)**  
Use the Edit feature to add and delete values for a list. You can also control the user and group access to the values in the list.
-   **[Renaming a list of values](../tasks/rm-lov-rename.md)**
