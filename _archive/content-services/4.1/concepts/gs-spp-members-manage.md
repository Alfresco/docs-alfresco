# Manage the Document Workspace membership

Only users who are members of the Document Workspace can work with the documents stored there. You perform the tasks relating to site members on the Members tab of the Document Management task pane.

You can:

-   Add members to the site
-   View a site member’s user profile
-   Edit your own user profile
-   Change a site member’s role

-   **[Add users to the site](../tasks/gs-spp-members-add.md)**  
Currently only User A, whose login credentials you used to create the Document Workspace, is a member of the SharePoint Protocol Support site. The user who creates the site is automatically given the role of Site Manager.
-   **[View and edit user profiles](../tasks/gs-spp-members-view.md)**  
You can view your own profile and the profiles of all other site members. However, you can only edit and change the password for your own profile.
-   **[Change a site member's role](../tasks/gs-spp-members-editrole.md)**  
There are four roles available in Share sites: Manager, Collaborator, Contributor, and Consumer. Only a Site Manager can manage site membership by changing a member’s role.
