-   **Hazelcast**

    Hazelcast is an in-memory open source data grid based on Java. By having multiple nodes form a cluster, data is evenly distributed among the nodes. This allows for horizontal scalability both in terms of available storage space and processing power. Backups are also distributed in a similar fashion to other nodes, based on configuration, thereby protecting against single node failure. Source: [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hazelcast)

-   **Hibernate**
