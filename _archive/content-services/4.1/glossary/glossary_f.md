    One or more FreeMarker templates are required to render the web script output in the format for your specific needs. A web script is invoked calling a URL. The URL response is rendered via one of the supplied templates and is chosen at run time based on the required response content-type or status outcome. The template has access to all URL arguments, common repository data entry points and any data items built by the optional execution script.
