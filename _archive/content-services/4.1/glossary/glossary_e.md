-   **Enterprise to Cloud Sync**

    The Alfresco Enterprise to Cloud Sync feature lets you work with your content without you needing access to the on-premise system. After you synchronize content to the cloud, the on-premise and cloud instances of your content are automatically synchronized with each other whenever either version is updated. This relationship continues until you unsync the content.

-   **execution script**

    It is possible to create web scripts relying only on the scripting capabilities of FreeMarker templating language. However, an optional execution script gives the web script greater flexibility, especially when creating and/or updating Alfresco objects. An execution script may be written in JavaScript or Java.

-   **<extension\>**

    The <extension\> directory is where you store files that extend and override the Alfresco default files. When Alfresco is installed, there are sample files in this directory. Many of these files have a .sample suffix, which must be removed to activate the file.

    For example: for Tomcat, <extension\> is:`<TOMCAT_HOME>/shared/classes/alfresco/extension/`
