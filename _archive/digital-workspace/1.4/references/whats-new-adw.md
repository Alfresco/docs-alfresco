**Create from template**

You can now create files and folders from templates. Creating a file from a template allows you to use standardized document layouts within your organization. Creating folders from templates speeds up the process of creating folder structures in Alfresco Digital Workspace and ensures you use a consistent hierarchical order.

For more information on templates see [Using templates](https://docs.alfresco.com/6.2/concepts/templated-nodes-intro.html).
