# Governance Services

Alfresco Digital Workspace has been extended to include Alfresco Governance Services functionality for end users. Working with records, and archiving files is quick and easy to do via the action menus of the Alfresco Digital Workspace.

These features require Alfresco Governance Services, and for archival to long term storage, Alfresco Content Connector for AWS S3.

See the following video for a quick introduction to the new governance features.
