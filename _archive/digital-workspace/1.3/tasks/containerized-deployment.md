# Containerized deployment

Alfresco Digital Workspace is deployed as part of Alfresco Content Services using Helm charts or a Docker Compose file. Both these methods include a lightweight, pre configured, NGINX server and Alfresco Digital Workspace application. Due to the limited capabilities of Docker Compose, this deployment method is recommended for development and test environments only.

It is recommended you familiarize yourself with the concepts of containerized deployment before working with Helm charts, and Docker. See [Understanding containerized deployment](http://docs.alfresco.com/6.2/concepts/deploy-overview.html) for more information.
