# Running Media Management automatically

You can configure the Media Management components \(Apache ActiveMQ and content services nodes\) to suit your specific requirements.

These topics explain how to configure Media Management to run automatically in a production environment. You must successfully install Media Management and the prerequisite software before using these topics. See [Prerequisites for using Media Management](mm-prereqs.md) and [Installing and configuring Media Management](mm-install-overview.md) for more information.

These instructions are for a Unix environment only.

These topics use `init.d` scripts. For more information on using these scripts, see [Init scripts](http://www.linux.com/learn/tutorials/442412-managing-linux-daemons-with-init-scripts).

Make sure you have set the correct permissions before configuring Media Management to run automatically.
