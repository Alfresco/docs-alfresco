# Admin Tools for Media Management

Administrators can view information about transformations and add publishing channels in the Admin Tools option of the Share menu bar.

1.  Select Admin Tools on the Share toolbar, to see a list of tools on the left of the page.
2.  The Tools \> Application section lists the themes available. Media Management provides a black background \(a dark theme\) for Share. See [Using an Alfresco dark site theme](../tasks/mm-using-dark.md) for more information.
3.  The Content Publishing \> Channel Manager section lists the channels that are configured for users to publish media. Channels available include Brightcove and CloudFront. Use this guidance to add a new publishing channel: [Configuring publishing channels for Media Management](mm-config-publish-channels.md).
4.  The Transformations section lists the installed transformers and their status. Select Transformer FFmpeg to see information on whether the transformer is available, and the version of FFmpeg that is installed with the options configured.
