# Installing Alfresco Content Connector for Salesforce - Lightning Experience

Use this information to install the AMP files in Alfresco, and the Alfresco App in Salesforce with the new Lightning Experience UI.

-   **[3. Configuring your app in Salesforce](../tasks/salesforce-ent-configure.md)**  
After you've installed the app, create a new connected app definition using the Salesforce Setup menu.
-   **[4. Enabling Salesforce in the Alfresco Admin Console](../tasks/salesforce-ent-auth.md)**  
You'll need to copy the Salesforce consumer key and consumer secret from your connected app into the Alfresco Admin Console. These credentials prove that Alfresco has permission to be displayed in and communicate with Salesforce.
-   **[5. Alfresco Setup tab: Adding an Alfresco site and mapping metadata in Salesforce](../tasks/salesforce-ent-add-site.md)**  
Configure the Alfresco site that you want to point to, and map your metadata.
-   **[6. Adding the Alfresco app in Salesforce](../tasks/salesforce-ent-add-app.md)**  
Lastly, you'll need to load the Alfresco canvas app for page layouts. You can add the app to any record type that supports layouts \(for example; Accounts, Cases, and Opportunities\). This is done by setting Alfresco for Salesforce example page layouts as the default for selected user profiles.
