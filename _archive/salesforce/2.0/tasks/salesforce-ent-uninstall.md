# Uninstalling the Salesforce app and AMP files

Remove the Alfresco package in Salesforce and then use the Module Management Tool \(MMT\) and remove the AMP files.

1.  In your Salesforce account, find Setup. This is often on the toolbar or under your name \(see [How to find Setup](https://help.salesforce.com/apex/HTViewHelpDoc?id=basics_nav_setup.htm) for more guidance on where to find this\).

    Search for Installed in the Quick Find search bar, and click Installed Packages.

2.  Click Uninstall next to the Alfresco Content Connector package, and confirm that you want to uninstall the package.

    For more information about removing packages in Salesforce, see [Uninstalling packages](https://help.salesforce.com/apex/HTViewHelpDoc?id=distribution_uninstalling_packages.htm).

3.  Stop the Alfresco server.

4.  Use the topic, [Uninstall an AMP file](http://docs.alfresco.com/5.2/tasks/uninstall-amp.html), to uninstall the AMP files for Salesforce.

5.  Restart the Alfresco server.
