# Using an Alfresco dark site theme

Alfresco Media Management provides a black background \(dark theme\) for Share, that mutes elements until they are required, and makes it easier to work with rich media content. If you're a site adminstrator you can enable this theme.

For more information about using themes in general, see [Share themes](http://docs.alfresco.com/5.2/concepts/themes-intro.html). Only an administrator can enable a theme.

1.  From the Alfresco toolbar, select Admin Tools and click Application in the Tools list.

    The Options page appears.

2.  Select Dark Theme from the menu.

    The new theme now displays every time that you use Alfresco unless you choose to change it again.
