# Transforming rich media

Alfresco Media Management allows you to request transformations of media from one format to another.

There are several methods used to request rich media transformations, and the method depends on the type of relationship that exists between the original source and the transformation result.

Renditions; for example, lower resolution JPEG image and video proxy files, are often requested automatically, when required in Alfresco. For example, they are requested when browsing a site's document library or navigating to the document details page.

You can explicitly request a rendition by clicking the **+** icon in the **Renditions** panel of the document details page. See [Viewing media](../tasks/mm-using-file.md) for more information about the Renditions panel.

You can perform an ad hoc format transformation in a number of ways; for example, create a rule with a Transform and Copy Content action. See [Applying rules to folders](http://docs.alfresco.com/5.2/concepts/library-folder-rules.html) for more information about setting up rules.
