title: Install Federation Services
---

The Federation Services capability for Alfresco Content Services is delivered in a number of installation files.

## Prerequisites

Check the [supported platforms]({% link federation-services/3.0/support/index.md %})Â for information on what you require before you start the installation.

> **Note**: A compatible version of Alfresco Governance Services (if you plan to use the Manage in Place capabilities) is required, for example: if using Alfresco Content Services 7.4, make sure that you install Alfresco Governance Services 7.4.

You can download the Federation Services software from [Hyland Community](https://community.hyland.com/){:target="_blank"}.

### Federation Services requirements

* Federation Services Admin server (i.e. 3Sixty Admin)
<!--* TSearch component (provides federated search capabilities)-->
* MongoDB server
* Tomcat server

    > **Note:** We recommend using a separate instance, where possible, instead of using the same one used by Alfresco Content Services.

See the [3Sixty documentation](https://helpdocs.objective.com/3sixty_user/Content/get-started/architecture.htm){:target="_blank"}, for specific hardware and software requirements.

> **Note:** This release of Alfresco Federation Services doesn't support deployment in Docker containers.
