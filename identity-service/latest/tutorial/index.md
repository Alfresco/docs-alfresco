The tutorials for the Identity Service include how to set up Single Sign On (SSO) capabilities for Alfresco products using LDAP, SAML and Kerberos.

> **Note:** There are two versions of the SSO Guide. Choose the version that applies to your installed version of Alfresco Content Services:
>
> * [Single Sign On (SSO) Guide v2]({% link identity-service/latest/tutorial/sso/index.md %}) - use for Content Services 7.3 and above
> * [Single Sign On (SSO) Guide v1]({% link identity-service/latest/tutorial/sso-v1/index.md %}) - use for versions of Content Services earlier than 7.3
