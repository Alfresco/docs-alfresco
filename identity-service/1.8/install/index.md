The Identity Service can be deployed into a new or existing Kubernetes cluster or installed manually using a standalone ZIP distribution.

There are two options for installing the Identity Service:

* [Install using Helm charts]({% link identity-service/1.8/install/k8s/index.md %})
* [Install using a ZIP distribution]({% link identity-service/1.8/install/zip/index.md %})

> **Note:** It is recommended that you familiarize yourself with the [concepts of containerized deployment]({% link content-services/latest/install/containers/index.md %}) before working with Docker, Kubernetes, and Helm.

Instructions are also provided for [upgrading the Identity Service]({% link identity-service/1.8/upgrade/index.md %}).
