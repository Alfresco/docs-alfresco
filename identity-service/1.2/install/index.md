title: Identity Service Installation Options
---

The Identity Service can be deployed into a new or existing Kubernetes cluster 
or installed manually using a standalone ZIP distribution.

There are two options for installing the Identity Service:

* [Deploying using Helm charts]({% link identity-service/1.2/install/k8s/index.md %})
* [Install manually using a ZIP distribution]({% link identity-service/1.2/install/zip/index.md %})

**Note:** It is recommended that you familiarize yourself with the [concepts of containerized deployment](TODO_LINK:https://docs.alfresco.com/6.1/concepts/deploy-overview.html) before working with Docker, Kubernetes, and Helm.

Instructions are also provided for [upgrading the Identity Service]({% link identity-service/1.2/upgrade/index.md %}).
