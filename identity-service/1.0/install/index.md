title: Install Identity Service into Kubernetes Cluster
---

The Identity Service can be deployed into a new or existing Kubernetes cluster.

It is recommended that you familiarize yourself with the concepts of containerized deployment before working with Docker, Kubernetes, and Helm. See [Understanding containerized deployment]({% link content-services/6.1/install/containers/index.md %}) for more information.

Prerequisites and details steps for a default deployment of the Identity Service into a cluster are within the [Alfresco/alfresco-identity-service](https://github.com/Alfresco/alfresco-identity-service/tree/1.0.0){:target="_blank"} GitHub project documentation. There are also details of [customizations](https://github.com/Alfresco/alfresco-identity-service/tree/1.0.0){:target="_blank"} available during deployment.

>**Note:** The Identity Service can also be deployed using Docker for Desktop (Mac) for trial and development purposes.
