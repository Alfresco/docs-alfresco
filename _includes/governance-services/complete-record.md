Content added to the {% include tooltip.html word="fileplan" text="File Plan" %} must be set to complete before it is recognized as a record.

1. Hover over an incomplete record in the File Plan and click **Complete Record**.

    >**Tip:** Incomplete records are marked.

    If a record has mandatory metadata that hasn't been completed then a message lets you know that required metadata is missing.

Once a record is {% include tooltip.html word="recordcompleted" text="completed" %}, it comes under the control of the record {% include tooltip.html word="category" text="category" %} it is filed under, and security restrictions apply.

>**Note:** A record can be filed in multiple categories, see [Linking records]({% link governance-services/latest/using/gs/manage-fileplan.md %}#linking-records) for more details.
