Electronic records are files that are uploaded to a records folder. Non-{% include tooltip.html word="electronicrecord" text="electronic records" %} might be paper files that 
can be stored in a physical location.

1. In the record folder where you want to file a record click **File**.

2. Click **Electronic**.

3. Click **Select Records to File** and find the file that you want to upload.

    >**Tip:** You can also select multiple items in the standard multi-select way.

    The files are uploaded as record and display in the {% include tooltip.html word="fileplan" text="File Plan" %} as incomplete records. You need to make sure any 
    required metadata is added before you can set records to {% include tooltip.html word="recordcompleted" text="complete" %}.
