2. Click **New Category**.

    The *New Record Category* dialog box displays.

3. Enter details for the new category. 

    |Metadata field|Description|
    |--------------|-----------|
    |Name|*Required.* The name for the record category.|
    |Title|*Required.* The title for the record category.|
    |Description|A description of the record category.|
    |Record Category ID|*Required.* A unique identifier for the record category is generated automatically. You can change this now, but you can't edit it once the category has been created.|
    |Vital Record Indicator|Defines whether records in this category have a review process. The Vital Record Indicator is applied to all record folders within that category. You can change this at folder level. <br><br>Users with Records Manager permissions receive a notification email when vital records are due for review.|
    |Period|The time period for the review cycle. Reviews are recurring based on the period you select. The review period is required when the **Vital Record Indicator** option is selected. The review period is displayed on the details page for folders and records in the category. <br><br>**Note:** The "Quarter" option splits the year into 4 sets of 3 months, beginning with Jan/Feb/March. "Financial Quarter" is the same but based on the start date of your system-configured financial year.|
    |Expression|Enter a number as the **Expression** to accompany the **Period** type. If you enter “Week” and “3”, this would mean a review cycle of 3 weeks. <br><br>If you select a Period that doesn't require an Expression then this field isn't available.|

4. Click **Save**.

    The new category displays in the File Plan.
