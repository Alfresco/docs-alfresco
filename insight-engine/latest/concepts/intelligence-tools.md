In addition to using Alfresco Insight Zeppelin for reporting you can also use any application that supports ODBC connectivity.

The CData ODBC Driver for Alfresco 2019 enables you to have real-time access to your data so you can run reports on the contents of the repository. Currently Alfresco has tested Tableau and Microsoft Excel. For more information and how to install the CData ODBC Driver see the following documentation [CData ODBC Driver for Alfresco 2019](http://cdn.cdata.com/help/SJE/odbc/default.htm).
