> **Note:** Search and Insight Engine 2.0 is compatible with Java 11 as long as you run Zeppelin in a Java 8 runtime. You can do this either in a VM or separate Java 8 based server. Java 11.0.9.1 and other four part Java versions are not compatible with versions 2.0.2 and below due to a bug in Jetty. This issue is resolved in version 2.0.3.
