Upgrading Content Services 5.x to Content Services with Search and Insight Engine

There are two steps to migrating your installation from Alfresco Content Services 5.x with Alfresco Search Services to Alfresco Content Services 6.2 with Alfresco Search and Insight Engine. First you need to upgrade to Alfresco Content Services 6.2 with Search Services, and then migrate Search Services to Search and Insight Engine.

1. Upgrade from Alfresco Content Services 5.x to Alfresco Content Services 6.2 see [Upgrading from Solr 4 to Solr 6 search](https://docs.alfresco.com/search-enterprise/tasks/solr4-solr6-migration.html).

    > **Note:** You can't do this using Docker Compose.

2. Migrate from Search Services to Search and Insight Engine see [Migrating from Search Services to Search and Insight Engine](upgrade-ss1.1-IE1.0.md).
