You can install Search and Insight Engine using the distribution zip or Docker Compose. There are two different ways you can install the software, the first is with mutual TLS, and the second is without mutual TLS (HTTP with secret word in request header).

> **Important:** From version 2.0, you cannot install Search and Insight Engine without mutual TLS (plain HTTP) because it is no longer supported.

## Install with mutual TLS (zip)

Use this information to install Search and Insight Engine on the same machine as Alfresco Content Services with mutual TLS.

Mutual TLS is used for authentication between the Repository and Search and Insight Engine.

This task assumes you have:

* Installed Alfresco Content Services 6.2 or above, see [Supported platforms]({% link search-services/latest/support/index.md %}).
* Set the following properties in the `<TOMCAT_HOME>/shared/classes/alfresco-global.properties` file:

    ```text
    index.subsystem.name=solr6
    solr.secureComms=https
    solr.port=8983
    ```

> **Important:** Alfresco strongly recommends you use firewalls and other infrastructure means to ensure the Search and Insight Engine server is not accessible from anything other than trusted hosts and/or users, and only on the ports needed for Search and Insight Engine.

1. Download `alfresco-insight-engine-2.0.x.zip` from the [Hyland Community](https://community.hyland.com/){:target="_blank"}.

2. Extract the Search and Insight Engine distribution.

    By default, the contents of `alfresco-insight-engine-2.0.x.zip` are decompressed in a root folder as `/alfresco-insight-engine`. See [Search and Insight Engine directory structure]({% link insight-engine/latest/config/index.md %}#search-and-insight-engine-directory-structure) for more details.

3. If you use several languages across your organization, you **must** enable cross-language search support in all fields. To do this update the `alfresco-insight-engine/solrhome/conf/shared.properties` file:

    ```bash
    alfresco.cross.locale.datatype.0={http://www.alfresco.org/model/dictionary/1.0}text
    alfresco.cross.locale.datatype.1={http://www.alfresco.org/model/dictionary/1.0}content
    alfresco.cross.locale.datatype.2={http://www.alfresco.org/model/dictionary/1.0}mltext
    ```

4. (Optional) Suggestion is disabled by default. To enable suggestion update the `alfresco-insight-engine/solrhome/conf/shared.properties` file.

    ```bash
    alfresco.suggestable.property.0={http://www.alfresco.org/model/content/1.0}name
    alfresco.suggestable.property.1={http://www.alfresco.org/model/content/1.0}title
    alfresco.suggestable.property.2={http://www.alfresco.org/model/content/1.0}description
    alfresco.suggestable.property.3={http://www.alfresco.org/model/content/1.0}content
    ```

    > **Note:** The spell check functionality does not work with Search and Insight Engine when suggestion is enabled.

5. To secure access to Search and Insight Engine, you must create a new set of keystores and keys.

    1. Generate secure keys specific to your Alfresco installation. For more information, see [Secure keys]({% link insight-engine/latest/config/keys.md %}#generate-secure-keys-for-ssl-communication).

    2. Create a new keystore directory at `alfresco-insight-engine/solrhome`.

    3. In the production environment, copy your custom keystore and truststore to the `alfresco-insight-engine/solrhome/keystore` directory.

    4. Update the SSL-related system properties by replacing `<SOLR_HOME> with alfresco-insight-engine/solrhome`, and set your keystore and truststore passwords.

        (Windows) update the `alfresco-insight-engine/solr.in.cmd` file:

        ```bash
        set SOLR_SSL_KEY_STORE=<SOLR_HOME>/keystore/ssl-repo-client.keystore
        set SOLR_SSL_KEY_STORE_PASSWORD=keystore
        set SOLR_SSL_KEY_STORE_TYPE=JCEKS
        set SOLR_SSL_TRUST_STORE=<SOLR_HOME>/keystore/ssl-repo-client.truststore
        set SOLR_SSL_TRUST_STORE_PASSWORD=truststore
        set SOLR_SSL_TRUST_STORE_TYPE=JCEKS
        set SOLR_SSL_NEED_CLIENT_AUTH=true
        set SOLR_SSL_WANT_CLIENT_AUTH=false
        ```

        (Linux) update the `alfresco-insight-engine/solr.in.sh` file:

        ```bash
        SOLR_SSL_KEY_STORE=<SOLR_HOME>/keystore/ssl-repo-client.keystore
        SOLR_SSL_KEY_STORE_PASSWORD=keystore
        SOLR_SSL_KEY_STORE_TYPE=JCEKS
        SOLR_SSL_TRUST_STORE=<SOLR_HOME>/keystore/ssl-repo-client.truststore
        SOLR_SSL_TRUST_STORE_PASSWORD=truststore
        SOLR_SSL_TRUST_STORE_TYPE=JCEKS
        SOLR_SSL_NEED_CLIENT_AUTH=true
        SOLR_SSL_WANT_CLIENT_AUTH=false
        ```

    5. Set the `SOLR_PORT` environment variable:

        (Windows) update the `alfresco-insight-engine/solr.in.cmd` file:

        ```bash
        set SOLR_PORT=8983
        ```

        (Linux) update the `alfresco-insight-engine/solr.in.sh` file:

        ```bash
        SOLR_PORT=8983
        ```

6. (Optional) If you want to install Search and Insight Engine on a separate machine, set the `SOLR_SOLR_HOST` and `SOLR_ALFRESCO_HOST` environment variables before starting Search and Insight Engine, for more see [Configuring Search and Insight Engine]({% link insight-engine/latest/config/index.md %}#search-and-insight-engine-externalized-configuration).

    (Windows) update the `alfresco-insight-engine/solr.in.cmd` file:

    ```bash
    set SOLR_SOLR_HOST=localhost
    ```

    ```bash
    set SOLR_ALFRESCO_HOST=localhost
    ```

    (Linux) update the `alfresco-insight-engine/solr.in.sh` file:

    ```bash
    SOLR_SOLR_HOST=localhost
    ```

    ```bash
    SOLR_ALFRESCO_HOST=localhost
    ```

7. To configure the Solr6 cores, set the following:

    * Before creating the alfresco and archive cores:
        * Set `alfresco.secureComms=https` in `alfresco-insight-engine/solrhome/templates/rerank/conf/solrcore.properties`.
        * Copy the custom keystores to the `alfresco-insight-engine/solrhome/keystore` directory.

            ```bash
            ssl-repo-client.keystore
            ssl-repo-client.truststore
            ```

    * If the alfresco and archive cores already exist, ensure that `alfresco.secureComms` is set to `https` for both the cores. For example:
        * `alfresco-insight-engine/solrhome/alfresco/conf/solrcore.properties`
        * `alfresco-insight-engine/solrhome/archive/conf/solrcore.properties`
8. For running a single instance of Search and Insight Engine (i.e. not sharded), use the following commands:

    ```bash
    cd alfresco-insight-engine
    ./solr/bin/solr start -a
    "-Dcreate.alfresco.defaults=alfresco,archive
    -Dsolr.ssl.checkPeerName=false
    -Dsolr.allow.unsafe.resourceloading=true
    -Dssl-keystore.password=keystore
    -Dssl-keystore.aliases=ssl-alfresco-ca,ssl-repo-client
    -Dssl-keystore.ssl-alfresco-ca.password=keystore
    -Dssl-keystore.ssl-repo-client.password=keystore
    -Dssl-truststore.password=truststore
    -Dssl-truststore.aliases=ssl-alfresco-ca,ssl-repo,ssl-repo-client
    -Dssl-truststore.ssl-alfresco-ca.password=truststore
    -Dssl-truststore.ssl-repo.password=truststore
    -Dssl-truststore.ssl-repo-client.password=truststore" -f
    ```

    > **Note:** The `-Dcreate.alfresco.defaults=alfresco,archive` command automatically creates the `alfresco` and `archive` cores. Therefore, you should only start Search and Insight Engine with `-Dcreate.alfresco.defaults=alfresco,archive` the first time you run Search and Insight Engine. Additionally, to ensure that Search and Insight Engine connects using the IPv6 protocol instead of IPv4, add `-Djava.net.preferIPv6Addresses=true` to the startup parameters. FInally, You should run this application as a dedicated user. For example, you can create a Solr user.

    The default port used is 8983.

    The command line parameter, `-a` passes additional JVM parameters, for example, system properties using `-D`.

    Once Search and Insight Engine is up and running, you should see a message like:

    ```text
    Waiting up to 180 seconds to see Solr running on port 8983 []  
    Started Solr server on port 8983 (pid=24289). Happy searching!
    ```

    To stop all instances of Search and Insight Engine, use:

    ```bash
    ./solr/bin/solr stop
    ```

    The logs are stored in the `alfresco-insight-engine/logs/solr.log` file, by default. This can be configured in `solr.in.sh` (for Linux) or `solr.in.cmd` (for Windows) using `SOLR_LOGS_DIR`.

    You have successfully created an `alfresco` core and an `archive` core. To verify, in a browser, navigate to the Solr URL, [https://localhost:8983/solr](https://localhost:8983/solr).

    > **Note:** You need to install the browser.p12 certificate in your browser before accessing this URL.

    In the Solr Admin UI, select the core selector drop-down list and verify that both the `alfresco` and `archive` cores are present.

    Allow a few minutes for Search and Insight Engine to start indexing.

If you are not using sharded Search and Insight Engine:

1. Access the **Admin Console > Search Service Sharding** page.
2. Deselect **Dynamic Shard Instance Registration**.
3. Select **Purge at Startup**.

## Install without mutual TLS - HTTP with secret word (zip)

Use this information to install Search and Insight Engine on the same machine as Alfresco Content Services without mutual TLS, using HTTP with a secret word in the request header. This means communication between the Repository and Search and Insight Engine is protected by a shared secret that is passed in a configurable request HTTP header.

**Important:** This installation method is only supported when using Content Services 7.1 and above.

This task assumes you have:

* Installed Alfresco Content Services 7.1 or above, see [Supported platforms]({% link search-services/latest/support/index.md %}).
* Set the following properties in the `<TOMCAT_HOME>/shared/classes/alfresco-global.properties` file:

    ```text
    index.subsystem.name=solr6
    solr.secureComms=secret
    solr.sharedSecret=password    
    solr.port.ssl=8983
    ```

> **Important:** To ensure the security of your system specify your own custom secret word for the `solr.sharedSecret` property, than the one provided in the example.

1. Download `alfresco-insight-engine-2.0.x.zip` from the [Hyland Community](https://community.hyland.com/){:target="_blank"}.

2. Extract the Search and Insight Engine distribution.

    By default, the contents of `alfresco-insight-engine-2.0.x.zip` are decompressed in a root folder as `/alfresco-search-services`. See [Search and Insight Engine directory structure]({% link insight-engine/latest/config/index.md %}#search-and-search-services-directory-structure) for more details.

3. Configure HTTP.

    Pass `alfresco.secureComms.secret` as a system property (using `-D` when starting Solr) by adding the startup parameters in step **7**:

   ```bash
   -Dalfresco.secureComms=secret
   -Dalfresco.secureComms.secret=password
   ```

    This ensures that the Solr cores are created in plain HTTP mode with the shared secret communication method. The property `alfresco.secureComms.secret` includes the same word used in the `solr.sharedSecret` property in the Repository configuration.

4. If you use several languages across your organization, you **must** enable cross-language search support in all fields. To do this add the following to the `alfresco-search-services/solrhome/conf/shared.properties` file:

    ```bash
    alfresco.cross.locale.datatype.0={http://www.alfresco.org/model/dictionary/1.0}text
    alfresco.cross.locale.datatype.1={http://www.alfresco.org/model/dictionary/1.0}content
    alfresco.cross.locale.datatype.2={http://www.alfresco.org/model/dictionary/1.0}mltext
    ```

5. (Optional) Suggestion is disabled by default. To enable suggestion update the `alfresco-search-services/solrhome/conf/shared.properties` file.

    ```bash
    alfresco.suggestable.property.0={http://www.alfresco.org/model/content/1.0}name
    alfresco.suggestable.property.1={http://www.alfresco.org/model/content/1.0}title
    alfresco.suggestable.property.2={http://www.alfresco.org/model/content/1.0}description
    alfresco.suggestable.property.3={http://www.alfresco.org/model/content/1.0}content
    ```

    > **Note:** The spell check functionality works with Search and Insight Engine when suggestion is enabled.

6. (Optional) If you want to install Search and Insight Engine on a separate machine, set the `SOLR_SOLR_HOST` and `SOLR_ALFRESCO_HOST` environment variables before starting Search and Insight Engine, for more see [Configuring Search and Insight Engine]({% link search-services/latest/config/index.md %}#search-services-externalized-configuration).

    (Windows) update the `alfresco-search-services`/`solr.in.cmd` file:

    ```bash
    set SOLR_SOLR_HOST=localhost
    ```

    ```bash
    set SOLR_ALFRESCO_HOST=localhost
    ```

    (Linux) update the alfresco-search-services/solr.in.sh file:

    ```bash
    SOLR_SOLR_HOST=localhost
    ```

    ```bash
    SOLR_ALFRESCO_HOST=localhost
    ```

7. To start Search and Insight Engine with all the default settings, use the following command:

    ```bash
    ./solr/bin/solr start -a "-Dcreate.alfresco.defaults=alfresco,archive"
    ```

    The command line parameter, `-a` passes additional JVM parameters, for example, system properties using `-D`.

    > **Note:** The `-Dcreate.alfresco.defaults=alfresco,archive` command automatically creates the `alfresco` and `archive` cores. Therefore, you should only start Search and Insight Engine with `-Dcreate.alfresco.defaults=alfresco,archive` the first time you run Search and Insight Engine. In addition you should run this application as a dedicated user. For example, you can create a Solr user. Finally, to ensure that Search and Insight Engine connects using the IPv6 protocol instead of IPv4, add `-Djava.net.preferIPv6Addresses=true` to the startup parameters.

    Once Search and Insight Engine is up and running, you should see a message similar to the following:

    ```bash
    Waiting up to 180 seconds to see Solr running on port 8983 []
    Started Solr server on port 8983 (pid=24289). Happy searching!
    ```

    To stop the currently running Search and Insight Engine instance, use:

    ```bash
    ./solr/bin/solr stop
    ```

    The logs are stored in the `alfresco-search-services/logs/solr.log` file, by default. This can be configured in `solr.in.sh` (for Linux) or `solr.in.cmd` (for Windows) using `SOLR_LOGS_DIR`.

    You have successfully created an `alfresco` core and an `archive` core. To verify, in a browser, navigate to the Solr URL, [http://localhost:8983/solr](http://localhost:8983/solr). In the Solr Admin UI, select the core selector drop-down list and verify that both the `alfresco` and `archive` cores are present.

    Allow a few minutes for Search and Insight Engine to start indexing.

8. Go to **Admin Console > Repository Services > Search Service** and verify that:

    1. You see the Solr 6 option in the **Search Service In Use** list.

    2. Under **Main (Workspace) Store Tracking Status**, the **Approx Transactions to Index** is **0**.

## Install with Docker Compose

Use this information to start up Alfresco Content Services 6.2 or above and Search and Insight Engine 2.0 using Docker Compose. Due to the limited capabilities of Docker Compose, this deployment method is recommended for development and test environments only.

### Prerequisites

* [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/){:target="_blank"}
  * This allows you to run Docker images and Docker Compose on a single computer.

* [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/){:target="_blank"}
  * Docker Compose is included as part of some Docker installers. If it's not part of your installation, then install it separately after you've installed Docker.

* Access to [Quay](https://quay.io/){:target="_blank"}
  * Docker requires access to certain images which are stored on Quay. You need to use the correct credentials provided by Alfresco to access these images. Contact [Alfresco Support](mailto:support@alfresco.com){:target="_blank"} to request the credentials.

> **Note:** Make sure the following ports are free on your computer: `5432`, `8080`. These ports are set in the `docker-compose.yml` file.

### Deployment steps

1. Download the latest Alfresco Content Services `docker-compose.yml` file by accessing the [Download Trial](https://www.hyland.com/en/resources/alfresco-ecm-download){:target="_blank"} page.

2. Save the file in a local folder.

3. Edit the file and change the `Solr 6` service. 

4. Add a `#` prefix to Alfresco Search and Insight Engine so it is commented out, and add the Alfresco Search and Insight Engine image location:

    ```yaml
        solr6:
            #image: alfresco/alfresco-search-services:2.0.x
            image: quay.io/alfresco/insight-engine:2.0.x
            ...
    ```

    > **Note:** If you want to use the Apache Zeppelin visualization interface with Search and Insight Engine you have to deploy it using Docker Compose along with Alfresco Content Services, you cannot install it manually. See [Building Reports and Dashboards]({% link insight-engine/latest/using/index.md %}#Installing with Docker Compose) for the additional container information you need to add to your `docker-compose.yml` file.

5. Save the file.

6. Log in to Quay using the following command:

    ```yaml
    $ docker login quay.io
                login against server at https://quay.io/v1/
                Username: <<Quay.io Credential Username>>
                Password: <<Quay.io Credential Password>>
    ```

7. Change directory to the location of the `docker-compose.yml` file and deploy Alfresco Content Services and Search and Insight Engine using the following command:

    ```bash
    docker-compose up
    ```

    This downloads the images, fetches all the dependencies, creates each container, and then starts the system. If you downloaded the project and changes were made to the project settings, any new images will be pulled from Quay before the system starts.

8. Wait for the logs to complete.

    If you encounter errors while the system is starting up:

    * Stop the session (by using `CONTROL+C`).
    * Remove the container (using the `--rmi all` option): For example `docker-compose down --rmi all`.
    * Try allocating more memory resources. As advised in `docker-compose.yml` set it to at least 16 GB. To adjust the memory, in Docker, go to **Preferences** (or **Settings**) > **Advanced** > **Memory**. Once you have adjusted the memory make sure you restart Docker and wait for the process to finish before continuing.
    * Go back to step 7 and retry the deployment.

9. Open your browser and check everything starts up correctly:

    * Alfresco: `http://localhost:8080/alfresco`
    * Share: `http://localhost:8080/share`
    * Solr: `http://localhost:8083/solr`

        > **Note:** When you access the solr url you will see the version of Search and Insight Engine that is installed.
