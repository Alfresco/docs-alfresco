title: Alfresco Search and Insight Engine 
---

Alfresco Search and Insight Engine is our new generation of analytics using Alfresco Search Services. It fully supports aspects, properties, ACLs, and Custom Metadata. It also supports SQL queries for reporting on the Solr data store using JDBC, and the dashboard comes pre-configured with some common reports.

Alfresco Search and Insight Engine enables scalability and performance under load for Alfresco Search Services. An Alfresco Search and Insight Engine subscription is required to deploy Search Services and Insight capability to separate server(s), to alleviate load or to split the search index across multiple servers for scalability (sharding).

Alfresco Insight Zeppelin is built on top of Apache Zeppelin 0.8.2 and comes bundled as a report builder. It is pre-configured to easily build custom reports with SQL, including against Custom Metadata. Alfresco Insight Zeppelin is the only supported visualization tool that works with Search and Insight Engine.

Currently the following are not supported with Alfresco Search and Insight Engine 2.0:

* Alfresco Process Services
* Reporting on audit and activity feeds from Alfresco Content Services
* Multi-tenancy
