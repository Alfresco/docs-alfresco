title: Solr Admin UI - center panel
---
The center of the screen shows the detail of the Solr core selected, such as statistics, summary report, and so on.

## Core-specific details

On the left-side of the Solr Admin screen, you will see **Core Selector**. Clicking on the menu displays a list of Solr cores hosted on this Solr node, with a search box that can be used to find a specific core by name.

This includes a sub-navigation for the option or text or graphical representation of the requested data.

See [Solr Admin UI - left panel](solradmin-left.md) to know more about each screen.
