## Using Filtered search

Use this information to get an overview of the filtered search capability in Alfresco Share along with its configuration details. It also describes how to define your own custom filters.

Filtered search is a powerful search feature that allows users to filter and customize their results by applying multiple filters to their search results in a navigational way. Filtered search breaks up search results into multiple categories, typically showing counts for each, and allows the user to drill down or further restrict their search results based on those filters.

You can configure filtered search either by using the [Filtered search configuration file and default properties](filtered-search-prop.md) or by using the [Share Search Manager](https://docs.alfresco.com/6.1/concepts/super-search-manager.html).
