Support for Salesforce Community allows external Salesforce Community Members to store and access documents in Alfresco. To provide access and share documents with external Salesforce Community Members, internal Salesforce users need to perform a series of actions.
Before you begin, ensure your internal Salesforce users have been added to the `GROUP_SALESFORCE_MODERATORS` group in Alfresco Content Services, for more see [Configure Salesforce Community]({% link salesforce/2.4/config/index.md %}#configure-a-salesforce-community).
This documentation describes a Salesforce Case object, however any standard or custom object can be shared externally with Community Members.

> **Note:** Support for Salesforce Community is only available when using Alfresco Cloud (PaaS).

## Community Visualforce Page Configuration and Setup

To expose the connector in a Salesforce Community (Digital Workspace) we need to add a visualforce page for the connector. 
Visualforce Page must be added to your Salesforce organization using the following template:

```xml
<apex:page docType="html-5.0" standardController="<Object API Name>">
 <apex:canvasApp id="AlfrescoConnector" applicationName="<Connected APP API Name>" width="100%" height="450px" scrolling="auto" parameters="{'community':'simple'}"/>  
</apex:page>
```

The connector is tied to a Standard or Custom Salesforce object. 

Insert your Object API Name as the value of the `standardController` attribute. For Example : Case or Opportunity

The `id` attribute is required and can be set to any non-empty, non-null value.

The `applicationName` attribute must be set to the API Name of the connected app created for the connector during the initial setup.

The `width`, `height`, and `scrolling` attributes can be set to values that meet the use case.

The most important attribute is the `parameters` attribute.  The value must be set to `{'community':'simple'}`.Without this value, the connector will surface the standard connector view. 

The Visualforce page will need to have the appropriate profiles added for it to be visible to the correct community users.

**Example 1:**

```xml
<apex:page docType="html-5.0" standardController="Case">
  <apex:canvasApp id="AlfCanvas3" applicationName="ACS_Salesforce" width="100%" height="450px" scrolling="auto" parameters="{'community':'simple'}"/>
</apex:page>
```

Add the new Visualforce Page to the desired record detail in your Salesforce Community.
