title: Alfresco Google Docs Integration
---

Google Docs Integration allows you to use Google Docs to edit document content stored in Alfresco Content Services, as an alternative to the online and offline editing capabilities in Alfresco Share.

To install Google Docs Integration, you need to apply the Google Docs AMP files to enable the feature.

With Google Docs Integration, you'll see new actions for creating documents, spreadsheets, and presentations. Also, you'll see an action called **Edit in Google Docs** on all supported document types.

> **Note**: When configuring Google Docs Integration with Alfresco Content Services, you don't need to identify a 'system' Google account.
