title: File and folder templates
---

With templated nodes and space templates you can store content (file) and folder templates in repositories that users can then use to create content.

Templated nodes provide a convenient way for users to quickly create content based on a pre-determined style, such as documents already formatted to company guidelines. Once a template has been stored in the repository users can create new content items based upon it from the **Create** menu in the **Document Library**.

Space templates let users quickly create folders. Content or other folder structures can be contained in the folder and are replicated when a folder is created from the template. Once a template has been stored in the repository users can create new folders based upon it from the **Create** menu in the **Document Library**.

You can have an unlimited number of templated nodes and space templates.

## Set files as templates

In the **Node Templates** folder you can store documents that users can then use as document templates.

1. In the **Repository** open the **Data Dictionary** then **Node Templates**.

2. Either drag and drop a content item that you want to use as a template onto the **Node Templates** drag and drop area, or click **Upload** and browse to and select the required file.

    >**Note:** The standard **Create** options are also available, so that you can create templates directly from Alfresco Share, in just the same way as a user would create new content.

    If you already have templated nodes set up, you can select **Create document from template** from the **Create** menu and create additional templates based on your existing templates.

3. Click **OK** when the upload is complete.

The file is now available to your users as a template when they select to create content **Create document from template**.

## Set folders as templates

In the **Space Templates** folder you can store folders that users can then use as folder templates.

1. In the **Repository** open the **Data Dictionary** then **Space Templates**.

2. Click **Create** then **Folder**.

    The new folder is added to the Space Templates folder. You can add content or further folders to this folder to create an entire folder structure. If users create a folder from this template the whole structure and all its contents will be replicated.

    >**Note:** If you already have space templates set up, you can select **Create folder from template** from the **Create** menu and create additional templates based on your existing templates.

The file is now available to your users as a template when they select to create content **Create document from template**.
