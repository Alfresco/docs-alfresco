title: Content Transformers (Renditions) Extension Point
---

Content Services provides many different types of content transformations out-of-the-box. Custom transformations 
can also be implemented and configured.

Architecture Information: [Platform Architecture]({% link content-services/6.2/develop/software-architecture.md %}#platformarch)

## Description

Content transformers transform one type of content into another, such as a HTML file into a PDF file. They are used to 
enable indexing, thumbnails, and preview of content. If the target type cannot be achieved with one transformation 
several transformations can be chained together, such as JSON to HTML to PDF. To implement these transformations, third 
party tools such as PDFBox, LibreOffice, ImageMagic, and Apache Tika are used. There are a number of transformations 
supported out of the box that you should familiarize yourself with before implementing a custom transformer, such as:

* PDF **to** Text, Html or XML
* Word, PowerPoint, Excel + other MS Office formats **->** Text, Html or XML
* HTML **to** Text
* Outlook Email .msg **to** Text
* RFC822 Email **to** Text
* Text **to** PDF
* Office Open XML **to** JPEG
* Apple iWorks files **to** PDFs or JPEGs
* ZIP, TAR **to** Text
* Mediawiki markup **to** HTML

These are just a few of the supported transformations and they can also be combined to form so called transformation 
pipelines when it is not possible to go directly from source mimetype to target mimetype. Renditions are related to 
Transformations and they will be covered at the end of this article.

To find out what transformers are currently registered and active within an Content Services installation, 
you can use an admin Web Script. This is available at 
[http://localhost:8080/alfresco/service/mimetypes](http://localhost:8080/alfresco/service/mimetypes){:target="_blank"}. 
This will list all the currently registered mimetypes, and provide a details link for each one. Selecting the details 
link will then show which transformations are currently supported both to and from that mimetype, and by what transformer. 
If a transformer becomes unavailable (for example, if the JOD/LibreOffice connection fails), then refreshing the list 
will show the updated transformations.

When working with transformations and renditions it is important to make sure that the involved mimetypes are known to 
Content Services. So when accessing the "mimetypes" Web Script make sure the mimetypes that will be used in 
transformations and renditions are included there, if not you would have to register them with Content Services, 
see the [Mimetypes extension point]({% link content-services/6.2/develop/repo-ext-points/mimetypes.md %}) for more information about that.

The Spring bean definitions for the transformer implementations can be found in the `content-services-context.xml` file. 
This file is contained in the repository JAR and can be found as follows in an installation:

```bash
$ find . -name "*.jar" | xargs grep "content-services-context.xml" 
Binary file ./tomcat/webapps/alfresco/WEB-INF/lib/alfresco-repository-5.1.d-EA.jar matches
```

Inside this XML file are the bean definitions for the transformer implementations, such as:

```xml
<bean id="transformer.PdfBox"
      class="org.alfresco.repo.content.transform.PdfBoxContentTransformer"
      parent="baseContentTransformer" >
  <property name="documentSelector" ref="pdfBoxEmbededDocumentSelector" />
</bean>
```

The transformer bean definition does not contain the source to target mimetype transformations it supports, rather 
this is contained in a properties file for easier management by a System Administrator (and these properties can be 
re-defined in` alfresco-global.properties`). This properties file is also located in the repository JAR 
(`/alfresco/subsystems/Transformers/default`) and is called `transformers.properties`. The configuration for the 
`PdfBoxContentTransformer` is as follows:

```text
content.transformer.PdfBox.priority=110 
content.transformer.PdfBox.extensions.pdf.txt.priority=50
content.transformer.PdfBox.extensions.pdf.txt.maxSourceSizeKBytes=25600
```

The `content.transformer.PdfBox.extensions.pdf.txt.maxSourceSizeKBytes=25600` property setting ensures that PDFBox works 
only with PDF files up to 25MB. Note also that the `content.transformer.TikaAuto.extensions.pdf.txt.maxSourceSizeKBytes=25600` 
property setting ensures that TikaAuto works only with PDF text files up to 25MB.

The properties have names that follow a certain convention:

```text
content.<transformer bean id>.<property name> (Some custom property for the transformer)
content.<transformer bean id>.priority=<number> (Default priority for this transformer)
content.<transformer bean id>.extensions.<source mimetype>.<target mimetype>.priority=<number>  (Priority for this transformation) 
content.<transformer bean id>.extensions.<source mimetype>.<target mimetype>.pipeline=transformer 1 | intermediate mimetype A)| transformer 2   
content.<transformer bean id>.extensions.<source mimetype>.<target mimetype>.failover=transformer 1 (mimetype A)| transformer 2 (mimetype A)
content.<transformer bean id>.extensions.<source mimetype>.<target mimetype>.supported=[true|false]
```

The concept of 'explicit' transformations does not exist but instead the `priority` and `supported` properties are used 
to determine what transformations that are used. As the default priority is 100, setting the priority to 50 normally 
results in the transformer being used. Other compatible transformers will be tried in priority order if the one with 
highest priority fails for some reason. If multiple transformations are needed to get from source to target mimetype a 
`pipeline` transformation can be set up. It is also possible to control exactly which transformers are used in case of 
a failure by using the `failover` property.

If you are running an Enterprise edition these properties may be changed via JMX while Content Services is 
running (note, any changes via JMX and database takes precedence over any property file settings).

You can create custom content transformers to transform one type of content into another, where that transformation 
is not already supported, such as when you have a custom input content type, or custom output content type. Take the 
JSON mimetype for example, if you upload a JSON file to the repository it will not have a thumbnail or a preview, and 
it will not be indexed and searchable.

The following will show up in the logs when debugging is turned on (turn it on via 
`log4j.logger.org.alfresco.repo.content.transform.TransformerDebug=DEBUG and log4j.logger.org.alfresco.repo.content.transform=DEBUG`):

```text

```

You can also see that there is no transformations available for the JSON mimetype on the 
`http://localhost:8080/alfresco/service/mimetypes?mimetype=application/json#application/json` admin page:

```text
**application/json - json**
   *No extractors*
   **Transformable To:** *Cannot be transformed into anything else*
   **Transformable From:** *Cannot be generated from anything else*
```

So if you wanted to change that you could implement a JSON to HTML transformation to start with. That would give you a 
lot of functionality as HTML is already fully supported with thumbnail, preview, indexing and search. To do this you 
will need a tool that can convert from JSON to HTML. One such tool is [json2html](https://github.com/softvar/json2html){:target="_blank"}, 
which is written in Python and can easily be invoked from the command line, and also then from a custom transformer. 
It produces a HTML table with the JSON data. To create this transformer you do not need to do any Java coding, just some 
Spring bean definitions and Python script coding.

Starting with the Spring beans for the custom transformer you would use the `RuntimeExecutableContentTransformerWorker` 
class as a bean implementation. It is able to execute any command line transformation that accepts an input and an output 
file on the command line. Basically, if you have a command line utility or a script that takes an input file, called the 
source, and an output file, called the target, then you can invoke it via this class. This is a technique used for a lot 
of custom transformation implementations.

Here is the Spring bean definition for what is referred to as the transformer worker:

```xml
<beans>
   <bean id="transformer.worker.json2html" class="org.alfresco.repo.content.transform.RuntimeExecutableContentTransformerWorker" >
    <property name="mimetypeService">
      <ref bean="mimetypeService" />
    </property>
    <property name="checkCommand">
      <bean class="org.alfresco.util.exec.RuntimeExec">
        <property name="commandsAndArguments">
          <map>
            <entry key=".*">
              <list>
                <value>ls</value>
                <value>/home/martin/Downloads/temp/transformation/convertJson2html.py</value>
              </list>
            </entry>
          </map>
        </property>
      </bean>
    </property>
    <property name="transformCommand">
      <bean class="org.alfresco.util.exec.RuntimeExec">
        <property name="commandsAndArguments">
          <map>
            <entry key=".*">
              <list>
                <value>/home/martin/Downloads/temp/transformation/convertJson2html.py</value>
                <value>${source}</value>
                <value>${target}</value>
              </list>
            </entry>
          </map>
        </property>
        <property name="errorCodes">
          <value>1,2</value>
        </property>
      </bean>
    </property>
  </bean>
```

The transformer worker does the actual job of executing the transformation. It has two important properties that need to 
be set, the `checkCommand` property, which is used to verify that the command line tool/script that is to be used for 
the transformation is actually available. The other property is called `transformCommand` and should contain the 
script/tool path plus the source and target variables, which will resolve to temporary files that will be used during 
the transformation. If you want to run one script on Linux and another one on Windows you can provide multiple entries 
in the command line arguments map as in the following example:

```xml
<property name="transformCommand">
      <bean class="org.alfresco.util.exec.RuntimeExec">
        <property name="commandsAndArguments">
          <map>
            <entry key="Windows.*">
              <list>
                <value>cmd</value>
                <value>/C</value>
                <value>${ffmpeg.exe} ${opts} ${infile_opts} -i "${source}" ${outfile_opts} "${target}" 2&gt; NUL</value>
              </list>
            </entry>
            <entry key="Linux">
              <list>
                <value>sh</value>
                <value>-c</value>
                <value>${ffmpeg.exe} ${opts} ${infile_opts} -i '${source}' ${outfile_opts} '${target}' 2&gt; /dev/null</value>
              </list>
            </entry>
            <entry key="Mac OS X">
              <list>
                <value>sh</value>
                <value>-c</value>
                <value>${ffmpeg.exe} ${opts} ${infile_opts} -i '${source}' ${outfile_opts} '${target}' 2&gt; /dev/null</value>
              </list>
            </entry>
          </map>
        </property>
        <property name="waitForCompletion">
          <value>true</value>
        </property>
        <property name="defaultProperties">
          <props>
            <prop key="opts">-y</prop>
            <prop key="infile_opts"/>
            <prop key="outfile_opts">-f flv</prop>
          </props>
        </property>
      </bean>
    </property>
```

When the transformation worker bean is defined you can refer to it from the transformation bean definition:

```xml
<bean id="transformer.json2html" class="org.alfresco.repo.content.transform.ProxyContentTransformer" parent="baseContentTransformer">
    <property name="worker">
       <ref bean="transformer.worker.json2html" />
    </property>
  </bean>
```

The transformer bean needs to specify `baseContentTransformer` as the parent, as it handles registering this new 
transformer with the Content Services system. The transformer implementation class that you use in this case 
is called `ProxyContentTransformer` and it is delegating the actual transformation to the worker. The last thing you 
need to do for this transformer to be active is to add some properties to `alfresco-global.properties`:

```text
content.transformer.json2html.priority=30
content.transformer.json2html.extensions.json.html.supported=true
content.transformer.json2html.extensions.json.html.priority=30
```

See above for more information about these properties.

Currently the transformer would halt on the Python script call as that has not yet been implemented. Download the 
`json2html` python module as follows:

```bash
$ sudo pip install json2html
```

Now create a script called `convertJson2html.py`:

```python
#!/usr/bin/python

import os, sys

lib_path = os.path.abspath(os.path.join('..'))
sys.path.append(lib_path)

from json2html import *

# Get the source and target file
print 'Number of arguments:', len(sys.argv), 'arguments.'
print 'Argument List:', str(sys.argv)
sourceTempFile = sys.argv[1]
targetTempFile = sys.argv[2]

# Open and read the JSON source file
with open(sourceTempFile, 'r') as jsonF:
   jsondata = jsonF.read()
print "Read json is : ", jsondata

# Run conversion to HTML
jsonAsHTML = json2html.convert(json = jsondata)

# Write the resulting HTML representation of the JSON to target file
with open(targetTempFile, 'w+') as htmlF:
   htmlF.write(jsonAsHTML)
```

You can test this script from command line before trying the transformation:

```bash
$ python convertJson2html.py testnode.json test.html
```

This assumes that the `testnode.json` file is in the same directory as the script is run from.

You are now ready to test this new JSON to HTML transformer. The only thing you need to do is create a rule that runs 
a script that does the following:

```text
document.transformDocument("text/html");
```

Uploading a JSON file to a folder with this rule will result in a new HTML file being generated as a result of the 
transformation, you will see something like this:

![dev-extensions-repo-transformations-json2html-result]({% link content-services/images/dev-extensions-repo-transformations-json2html-result.png %})

You can see that the newly generated HTML file has a thumbnail (refresh the page to see it). If you navigate to the 
details page a preview will also be available, and you can search for the content in the JSON file and you would see 
the HTML version of it. You could expand the JavaScript file to move the generated HTML file somewhere else in the 
repository if you needed to.

The next step is to create a pipeline transformation JSON to HTML to TEXT to make the JSON searchable and to avoid 
having the extra HTML file generated. This can be achieved with some extra properties in the configuration:

```text
content.transformer.json2text.pipeline=*|html|*
content.transformer.json2text.extensions.json.txt.priority=30
content.transformer.json2text.extensions.json.txt.supported=true
```

 This defines a transformation pipeline (also referred to as a complex transformer). With the `*|html|*` expression 
 means convert any supported extension (that is only json to txt) by using any transformer that can convert JSON to 
 first the intermediate format HTML, which is what the transformer we just implemented above does, then use any other 
 transformer to convert HTML to TXT, which is supported out-of-the-box. After this change you will see that any 
 uploaded JSON file is now searchable (remember to disable the rule). Note that there is no Spring bean defined for 
 the `transformer.json2text`.

 To get the thumbnail you need to define another pipeline for JSON to PNG:

```text
content.transformer.json2png.pipeline=*|html|*
content.transformer.json2png.extensions.json.png.priority=30
content.transformer.json2png.extensions.json.png.supported=true
```

Running with this pipeline configuration will first initiate a transform to HTML and then to PNG with any out-of-the-box 
transformer supporting HTML to PNG.

Finally you can get the preview working with the following JSON to PDF pipeline configuration:

```text
content.transformer.json2pdf.pipeline=*|html|*
content.transformer.json2pdf.extensions.json.pdf.priority=30
content.transformer.json2pdf.extensions.json.pdf.supported=true
```

Content Services supports PDF previewing so as long as you can transform your content into a PDF it will be 
available for preview in the Document Details page.

When implementing a transformer, it is possible to associate it with an Edition, such as in the following example:

```text
content.transformer.complex.JodConverter.PdfBox.edition=Enterprise
```

This sets the `transformer.complex.JodConverter` to be available only for Content Services installations. 
It is also possible to associate a transformer with a specific AMP:

```text
content.transformer.json2html.amp=custom-content-transformer-repo
```

This would make your custom JSON content transformer available only if an AMP with module id `custom-content-transformer-repo` 
has been applied.

Related to transformations are **renditions**, and the purpose of them is to provide support for rendering a specific 
content item into other forms, known as renditions. The rendition items are derived from their source item and as such 
can be updated automatically when their source item's content (or other properties) are changed.

Examples of renditions (and rendition engines) include:

* `reformat` - Transforms content to new format - redirects to vanilla transformers
* `image` - Rescales images (including thumbnails)
* `freemarker` - Runs a FreeMarker template against source content
* `xslt` - Runs XSLT on XML source content
* `composite` - A rendition series

Renditions can be performed synchronously or asynchronously and can be created at a specified location within the repository. 
By default they are created as primary children of their source item but it is possible to have them created at other places 
specified explicitly or as templated paths.

The following describes an example with the `reformat` rendering engine and the custom transformation you have previously 
implemented (that is json to html). You can invoke the rendering engine and create an HTML rendition for a JSON document 
via JavaScript executed from a folder rule:

```javascript
var renderingEngineName = 'reformat';
var renditionDefinitionName = 'cm:htmlRenditionDef';
var renditionDef = renditionService.createRenditionDefinition(renditionDefinitionName, renderingEngineName);
renditionDef.parameters['mime-type'] = 'text/html';
var htmlRendition= renditionService.render(document, renditionDef);
```

The rendition definition name is a QName that we have to come up with, use a known namespace such as `cm`. 
The `mime-type` parameter tells the `reformat` rendering engine that the new rendition should be a HTML file. 
By default this rendition will be store as a hidden child to the uploaded JSON document. If you used the Node Browser 
to inspect the JSON content node you should see three hidden renditions as follows:

```text
**Children    **
Child Name          Child Type   Child Reference                                               Primary  Association Type  Index
*cm:htmlRenditionDef  cm:content   workspace://SpacesStore/78448da2-fbab-4ef1-b451-6bbaa569b8c4  true     rn:rendition       0*
cm:doclib            cm:thumbnail workspace://SpacesStore/f7f354a7-010f-4462-82a1-7cec7f36fa1d  true     rn:rendition       1
cm:pdf               cm:thumbnail workspace://SpacesStore/8b3ec283-cd2a-4378-af2d-e72e30127210  true     rn:rendition       2
```

If the solution being implemented is very transformation intensive a remote, then use the 
[Document Transformation Engine]({% link content-services/6.2/admin/transformations.md %}#doctransformengine). It 
would be totally dedicated to performing transformations, and can be scaled out separately from the rest of the 
Content Services system, depending on transformation load.

It is possible for an AMP (or a properties file) to set higher (numerically lower) priorities for new transformers than 
the standard transformers, so that they are used rather than the standard ones.

The default transformer priority is 100. Priorities may be specified at the level of one mimetype to another and if a 
new transformer returns false from its `isTransformable` method transformations will still fall back to the and JOD 
transformer. The following are the priority properties for transformers that use the JOD transformer.

```text
transformer.OpenOffice=3600000
transformer.complex.OpenOffice.Image.time=3600000
transformer.complex.OpenOffice.Pdf2swf.time=3600000
transformer.complex.OpenOffice.PdfBox.time=3600000

transformer.JodConverter.time=3600000
transformer.complex.JodConverter.Image.time=3600000
transformer.complex.JodConverter.Pdf2swf.time=3600000
transformer.complex.JodConverter.PdfBox.time=3600000
```

If an initial 'XXX.time' global property is supplied for a transformer, the number of transformations performed may 
also be supplied with a '.count' value. The default being 10,000. This avoids the average time reducing too fast if 
transformations are requested (because the new transformer is not available). A higher number ensures it reduces at a 
slower rate. For example, 1,000,000:

```
transformer.OpenOffice.count=1000000
transformer.complex.OpenOffice.Image.count=1000000
transformer.complex.OpenOffice.Pdf2swf.count=1000000
transformer.complex.OpenOffice.PdfBox.count=1000000

transformer.JodConverter.count=1000000
transformer.complex.JodConverter.Image.count=1000000
transformer.complex.JodConverter.Pdf2swf.count=1000000
transformer.complex.JodConverter.PdfBox.count=1000000
```
