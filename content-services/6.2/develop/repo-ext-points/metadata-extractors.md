title: Metadata Extractors Extension Point
---

Content Services performs metadata extraction on content automatically, however, you may wish to create 
custom metadata extractors to handle custom file properties and custom content models.

Architecture Information: [Platform Architecture]({% link content-services/6.2/develop/software-architecture.md %}#platformarch)

## Description

Every time a file is uploaded to the repository the file's MIME type is automatically detected. Based on the MIME type a 
related Metadata Extractor is invoked on the file. It will extract common properties from the file, such as author, 
and set the corresponding content model property accordingly. Each Metadata Extractor has a mapping between the 
properties it can extract and the content model properties. Metadata extraction is primarily based on the 
[Apache Tika](https://tika.apache.org/){:target="_blank"} library. This means that whatever [file formats](https://tika.apache.org/1.11/formats.html){:target="_blank"} 
Tika can extract metadata from, Content Services can also handle. To give you an idea of what file formats 
Content Services can extract metadata from, here is a list of the most common formats: 

* PDF
* MS Office
* Open Office
* MP3, MP4, QuickTime
* JPEG, TIFF, PNG
* DWG
* HTML
* XML
* Email

The properties that are extracted are limited to the out-of-the-box content model, which is very generic. Here are 
some example of extracted property name and what content model property it maps to:

* author -> `cm:author`
* title -> `cm:title`
* subject -> `cm:description`
* created -> `cm:created`
* description -> *NOT MAPPED* - you could map it in a custom configuration
* comments -> *NOT MAPPED* - you could map it in a custom configuration
* *If it is an image file:*
* EXIF metadata -> `exif:exif` (pixel dimensions, manufacturer, model, software, date-time etc.)
* Geo metadata -> `cm:geographic` (longitude & latitude)
* *If it is an audio file* -> `audio:audio` (album, artist, composer, engineer, genre etc.)
* *If it is an email file* -> `cm:emailed` (from, to, subject, sent date)

One thing to note though, even if an extractor can extract any of the system controlled properties, such as created date, 
it will not be used. Created date, creator, modified date, and modifier is always controlled by the Content Services 
system, unless you are using the Bulk Import tool, in which case last modified date can be preserved.

A common requirement is to be able to change the mapping of out-of-the-box properties, such as having the `subject` 
property mapped to `cm:title` instead of `cm:description`. This is quite easy to achieve, just override the out-of-the-box 
bean and re-configure the mapping. The out-of-the-box Spring bean definitions for Metadata Extractors can be found in the 
`content-services-context.xml` file, which is located [here](https://github.com/Alfresco/community-edition/tree/master/projects/repository/config/alfresco){:target="_blank"}. 
Search for "Content Metadata Extractors" in the file and then you will find an ordered list of extractor definitions.

When overriding a Metadata Extractor configuration you have the option to inherit the default properties mapping or 
define a new one from scratch. For example, to change the `subject` property so it is mapped to content model property 
`cm:title` for PDF files re-define the `extracter.PDFBox` Spring bean as follows:

```xml
<bean id="extracter.PDFBox" class="org.alfresco.repo.content.metadata.PdfBoxMetadataExtracter"        
    parent="baseMetadataExtracter">
  <property name="documentSelector" ref="pdfBoxEmbededDocumentSelector" />
  <property name="inheritDefaultMapping">
      <value>false</value>
  </property>
  <property name="mappingProperties">
      <props>
          <prop key="namespace.prefix.cm">http://www.alfresco.org/model/content/1.0</prop>
          <prop key="author">cm:author</prop>
          <prop key="subject">cm:title</prop>
          <prop key="Keywords">cm:description</prop>
      </props>
  </property>
</bean>
```

In this case you also map the `author` property. This is because when you set the `inheritDefaultMapping` property to 
`false` all the default property mappings are not used. Another property called `Keywords` have also been mapped to the 
`cm:description` property. Note that all the namespaces that the content model properties belong to have to be specified 
as in the above example with `namespace.prefix.cm`. It is also very important to know that the property names are 
case sensitive. So if the Keyword property had been written with a lower-case `k`, it would not have been picked up. 
Sometimes it can be useful to know what metadata extractor that is actually used when you upload a document. Turning on 
Metadata Extraction logging is a good idea to get on top of what is happening. 
Set the following property in `log4j.properties`:

```text
log4j.logger.org.alfresco.repo.content.metadata=DEBUG
```

With logging turned on the following information will be logged when uploading a PDF:

```text

```

You can clearly see that the PDFBox extractor is invoked so you know you have customized the correct one. What about the 
properties? It is likely that you will struggle to figure out what properties are extracted and their names. You can 
have this logged with the following log file configuration:

```text
log4j.logger.org.alfresco.repo.content.metadata.AbstractMappingMetadataExtracter=DEBUG
```

This log configuration is set to some other log level out-of-the-box so you need to specifically re-configure it to be 
able to see something. Now when running you will also see the extracted doc properties as in the following example:

```text
Found: {
   pdf:PDFVersion=1.4, 
   xmp:CreatorTool=Writer, 
   Keywords=SomeKeyword1, SomeKeyword2, 
   subject=SomeSubject, 
   dc:creator=Martin Bergljung, 
   description=SomeSubject, 
   dcterms:created=2015-12-07T14:22:15Z, 
   dc:format=application/pdf; version=1.4, 
   title=SomeTitle, 
   dc:title=SomeTitle, 
   pdf:encrypted=false, 
   cp:subject=SomeSubject, 
   Content-Type=application/pdf, 
   creator=Martin Bergljung, 
   comments=null, 
   meta:author=Martin Bergljung, 
   dc:subject=SomeKeyword1, SomeKeyword2, 
   meta:creation-date=2015-12-07T14:22:15Z, 
   created=2015-12-07T14:22:15Z, 
   author=Martin Bergljung, 
   xmpTPg:NPages=1, 
   Creation-Date=2015-12-07T14:22:15Z, 
   meta:keyword=SomeKeyword1, SomeKeyword2, 
   Author=Martin Bergljung, producer=LibreOffice 4.2
}
```

There is also a log entry with information about what properties that were actually successfully mapped:

```text
Mapped and Accepted: {
   {http://www.alfresco.org/model/content/1.0}description={en_GB=SomeKeyword1, SomeKeyword2}, 
   {http://www.alfresco.org/model/content/1.0}title={en_GB=SomeSubject}, 
   {http://www.alfresco.org/model/content/1.0}author=Martin Bergljung}

```

Next requirement is most likely to map properties to custom content models. There is an ACME content model tutorial 
where the base document type has an `acme:documentId` property. You might want to add a document identifier to the PDFs 
you are uploading and have it automatically set in the ACME content model. Start by updating the extractor configuration 
as follows:

```xml
<bean id="extracter.PDFBox" class="org.alfresco.repo.content.metadata.PdfBoxMetadataExtracter"
       parent="baseMetadataExtracter">
     <property name="documentSelector" ref="pdfBoxEmbededDocumentSelector" />
     <property name="inheritDefaultMapping">
         <value>false</value>
     </property>
     <property name="mappingProperties">
         <props>
             <prop key="namespace.prefix.cm">http://www.alfresco.org/model/content/1.0</prop>
             <prop key="namespace.prefix.acme">http://www.acme.org/model/content/1.0</prop>
             <prop key="author">cm:author</prop>
             <prop key="subject">cm:title</prop>
             <prop key="Keywords">cm:description</prop>
             <prop key="DocumentId">acme:documentId</prop>
         </props>
     </property>
 </bean>
```

Here the custom document property `DocumentId` has been added so it is mapped to the ACME content model property 
`acme:documentId`. When doing this you also need to define the new custom namespace `acme`. For this to work you need 
to have a rule on the folder that applies the `acme:document` type to any PDF document uploaded to the folder. This 
type has the `acme:docuementId` property.

Now, what if you would like to extract metadata from an XML file, how would you go about that? This can be achieved with 
the `XmlMetadataExtracter`, which in-turn uses the `XPathMetadataExtracter` to navigate the XML and extract metadata. 
Let's say we had XML files looking like this:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<doc id="doc001">
    <project>
        <number>PX001</number>
    </project>
    <securityClassification>Company Confidential</securityClassification>
    <text>
        Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Praesent tincidunt luctus ante, in pulvinar ante rutrum
        quis. Etiam maximus arcu ut metus sollicitudin laoreet. Pellentesque ac purus nec massa euismod iaculis a sed
        sapien. Integer id nisi eu tellus commodo congue. In bibendum dapibus porttitor. Aenean lobortis sodales risus
         ....
    </text>
</doc>
```

And whenever we upload one we want to have the `/doc/@id` attribute set as `acme:documentId`, `/doc/project/number` 
set as `acme:projectNumber`, and `/doc/securityClassification` set as `acme:securityClassification`. This will require 
configuration like this, note these are new bean definitions, no overrides as in previous examples:

```xml
<bean id="org.alfresco.tutorial.metadataextracter.xml.AcmeDocXPathMetadataExtracter"
    class="org.alfresco.repo.content.metadata.xml.XPathMetadataExtracter"
    parent="baseMetadataExtracter"
    init-method="init">
  <property name="mappingProperties">
      <bean class="org.springframework.beans.factory.config.PropertiesFactoryBean">
          <property name="location">
              <value>
                  classpath:alfresco/module/${project.artifactId}/metadataextraction/acme-content-model-mappings.properties
              </value>
          </property>
      </bean>
  </property>
  <property name="xpathMappingProperties">
      <bean class="org.springframework.beans.factory.config.PropertiesFactoryBean">
          <property name="location">
              <value>
                  classpath:alfresco/module/${project.artifactId}/metadataextraction/acme-xml-doc-xpath-mappings.properties
              </value>
          </property>
      </bean>
  </property>
</bean>

<bean id="org.alfresco.tutorial.metadataextracter.xml.selector.AcmeDocXPathSelector"
    class="org.alfresco.repo.content.selector.XPathContentWorkerSelector"
    init-method="init">
  <property name="workers">
      <map>
          <entry key="/*">
              <ref bean="org.alfresco.tutorial.metadataextracter.xml.AcmeDocXPathMetadataExtracter"/>
          </entry>
      </map>
  </property>
</bean>

<bean id="org.alfresco.tutorial.metadataextracter.xml.AcmeDocXMLMetadataExtracter"
      class="org.alfresco.repo.content.metadata.xml.XmlMetadataExtracter"
      parent="baseMetadataExtracter">
  <property name="overwritePolicy">
      <value>EAGER</value> <!-- Put the extracted metadata into the content model property as long as it is not null -->
  </property>
  <property name="selectors">
      <list>
          <ref bean="org.alfresco.tutorial.metadataextracter.xml.selector.AcmeDocXPathSelector"/>
      </list>
  </property>
</bean>
```

The `acme-content-model-mappings.properties` file contains mappings from the extracted XML doc properties to the 
content model properties:

```text
# Namespaces
namespace.prefix.acme=http://www.acme.org/model/content/1.0

# Mappings - metadata property -> content model property
documentId=acme:documentId
securityClassification=acme:securityClassification
projectNumber=acme:projectNumber
```

The property mapping can always be done in .properties files if we like, and we could have used a .properties file for 
the `PDFBoxMetadataExtracter` too. The other properties file called` acme-xml-doc-xpath-mappings.properties` contains the 
XPath expression configuration for where to find the metadata in the XML file:

```text
# XPath Mappings - metadata property -> XML Document XPATH
documentId=/doc/@id
securityClassification=/doc/securityClassification
projectNumber=/doc/project/number
```

## Metadata extractor limits

Metadata extraction limits allows configurations on `AbstractMappingMetadataExtracter` for:

* control of the maximum time allowed for an extraction
* control of the maximum size (MB) of any single document that the extractor will handle
* control of the maximum number of all the documents being processed at any point in time

The default values for each of these properties are `MAX` value specified in the java code. These limits are configured 
per extractor and mimetype.

The limits configured for Content Services are:

```text
Time out configured for all extractor and all mimetypes
content.metadataExtracter.default.timeoutMs=20000

Maximum size of a document to process - configured for PdfBoxMetadataExtracter , pdf files
content.metadataExtracter.pdf.maxDocumentSizeMB=10

Maximum number of concurrent extractions - configured for PdfBoxMetadataExtracter , pdf files
content.metadataExtracter.pdf.maxConcurrentExtractionsCount=5
```

## PDF metadata extractor overwrite policy

There are four types of overwrite policies that can be used when extracting metadata:

* `EAGER`
* `CAUTIOUS`
* `PRUDENT`
* `PRAGMATIC`

The following table shows which conditions must be met for overwriting the value:

![overwrite-policy]({% link content-services/images/overwrite-policy.png %})

The default overwrite policy is `PRAGMATIC`. To change the overwrite policy, set the `overwritePolicy` property. For example:

```xml
<property name="overwritePolicy"> <value>EAGER</value> </property>
```

To change the overwrite policy for the PDF metadata extractor, set the `overwritePolicy` property in the 
`alfresco-global.properties`. For example:

```text
content.metadataExtracter.pdf.overwritePolicy=EAGER
```

## Deployment - App Server

* `tomcat/shared/classes/alfresco/extension` - change name of `custom-metadata-extractors-context.xml.sample` to `custom-metadata-extractors-context.xml` and define extractor beans. Change name of `metadata-embedding-context.xml.sample` to `metadata-embedding-context.xml` and make embedder bean definitions.

## Deployment All-in-One SDK project

* `aio/platform-jar/src/main/resources/alfresco/module/platform-jar/context/service-context.xml` - Metadata Extractor bean definitions and metadata embedder bean definitions
* `aio/platform-jar/src/main/resources/alfresco/module/platform-jar/metadataextraction` - Properties files with mappings
