title: Repo JavaScript Root Objects Extension Point
---

A number of JavaScript root objects are available when you are implementing a controller for a Repo Web Script, such as 
`companyhome` and `people`. Sometimes you might have custom Java code that you want to call from JavaScript controllers, 
this is possible by adding custom JavaScript root objects.

Architecture Information: [Platform Architecture]({% link content-services/6.2/develop/software-architecture.md %}#platformarch)

## Description

It is possible to create and add custom script APIs implemented in Java and accessible as root objects in JavaScript. 
This provides an integration point for Content Services extensions to provide custom JavaScript APIs where appropriate.

In order to implement a custom JavaScript API it is recommended that you develop a POJO (Plain Old Java Object) that 
extends the base class `org.alfresco.repo.processor.BaseProcessorExtension`. The `public` methods of your class will be 
those that will be accessible from JavaScript.

Let's implement a custom root object that can print text to the log (i.e. `tomcat/logs/catalina.out`):

```java
package org.alfresco.training.jscript;
import org.alfresco.repo.processor.BaseProcessorExtension;

public class CustomProcessorExtension extends BaseProcessorExtension {
 public void log2StdOut(String text) {
  System.out.println(text);
 }
}   
```

This class needs to be defined as a Spring Bean with parent set to `baseJavaScriptExtension`:

```xml
<bean id="org.alfresco.training.customRootObject" 
         class="org.alfresco.training.jscript.CustomProcessorExtension" 
         parent="baseJavaScriptExtension">
    <property name="extensionName" value="custom" />
</bean>
```

The `extensionName` property is used to configure what root object name you want to use in the JavaScript controllers.

The new `custom` root object can now be used in the JavaScript controller as follows:

```text
custom.log2StdOut("Hello World!");
```

## Deployment - App Server

JavaScript root object implementations does not lend themselves very well to be manually installed in an application server. 

See Deployment SDK Project instead.

## Deployment All-in-One SDK project

* `aio/platform-jar/src/main/java` - put the implementation class for the root object somewhere under this directory
* `aio/platform-jar/src/main/resources/alfresco/module/platform-jar/context/service-context.xml` - put the root object Spring bean here.
