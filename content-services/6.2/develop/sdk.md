title: Alfresco SDK
---

Alfresco SDK 4.1 is a Maven based development kit that provides an easy to use approach to developing applications and 
extensions for Alfresco. With this SDK you can develop, package, test, run, document and release your Alfresco extension project.

The Alfresco Software Development Kit (Alfresco SDK) is a fundamental tool provided by Alfresco to developers to build 
customizations and extensions for the Alfresco Digital Business Platform. It is based on [Apache Maven](http://maven.apache.org/){:target="_blank"} 
and [Docker](https://www.docker.com/){:target="_blank"} and is compatible with major IDEs. This enables Rapid Application Development (RAD) 
and Test Driven Development (TDD).

Alfresco SDK 4.1 is released under [Apache License version 2.0](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html){:target="_blank"} 
and supports Content Services both in Community Edition and Enterprise Edition. If you're an Enterprise customer, 
please check the [Alfresco SDK Support status]({% link content-services/6.2/support/index.md %}) 
for the version you're using. If your version is in Limited or Full Support and you need help, contact our [Support team](https://support.alfresco.com/){:target="_blank"}.

Alfresco SDK 4.1 is a minor update to the SDK and provides support for Alfresco 6.2.x.

The 4.0 release takes advantage of Semantic Versioning ([SEMVER](http://semver.org/){:target="_blank"}), which means that 
this new release is not directly compatible with the previous releases of the SDK.

If you have existing projects that you wish to upgrade to SDK 4.1.x, the recommended approach is to generate a new project 
from our archetypes and move your code into place.

## What's new?

Alfresco SDK 4.0 brings some changes oriented to assist the way the customizations are built, packaged, run and tested for Content Services 6 and 
Alfresco Share 6.

This is a mayor release oriented to support Alfresco 6, so it is not compatible with previous versions of the SDK.

### Embracing containers and Docker

The main change included in SDK 4.0 is the addition of container technologies. Specifically, the new SDK is highly based 
on [Docker](https://www.docker.com/){:target="_blank"} and [Docker compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/){:target="_blank"} 
to offer a solution aligned with the architectural decisions made in Alfresco for version 6: moving towards microservices-oriented 
solutions.

Working with Docker images gives the developers the opportunity to easily customize the deployment of the local environment to adapt it to their requirements.
Adding, removing and configuring services in the environment is as easy as modifying the Docker compose descriptor file.

### Support for Java 11

[Java 11](https://openjdk.java.net/projects/jdk/11/){:target="_blank"} is the next Long Term Support (LTS) version that provides support for 3 years. Alfresco 6.1 already offers
support for this version of the Java platform.

Alfresco SDK 4.0 has been modified to add support for Java 11 as well. This way, if you're working as a developer in customizations for Alfresco 6.1 you must
now use SDK 4.0 + JDK 11 to work on them. The Apache Maven plugins included in the archetypes has been updated to avoid any issue with Java 11.

### Easy dependency configuration

The configuration of the Maven dependency management has been greatly improved thanks to the addition of a _bill of materials_ (BOM). 

The inclusion of the BOM dependency in the `dependencyManagement` section of the `pom.xml` file of the projects generated using the archetypes imports all 
artifacts in the selected Alfresco platform version. It is still needed to define dependencies in the POM files, but the version can be omitted as it's 
enforced by this `dependencyManagement`. 

That incredibly eases the management of the versions of the different Alfresco platform's dependencies required in a customization project.

### Alfresco Maven Plugin no longer needed

Alfresco SDK 4.0 manages the lifecycle of the generated projects making use of proper [utility scripts](#workingwithrunscript) 
(`run.sh` / `run.bat`). That avoids the need of using the Alfresco Maven Plugin and eases the process to modify the lifecycle of the customization projects.

If a development team has straightforward requirements and doesn't want to worry about the complexity of working with containers, it can use the utility scripts
as they are. But, if any development team has a requirement or a development process that requires a customization in the project development lifecycle, it is 
easy to modify the utility scripts, the Docker files or the Docker compose descriptor to adapt the SDK projects to their needs.

The Alfresco Maven Plugin is only required in those cases in which it is required to package the customization project as an AMP. For more information about 
how to work with AMPs, please visit [Working with AMPs](#workingwithamps).

### Integration testing

The integration tests and the mechanisms to execute them in an Alfresco Content Service instance remains the same as in the previous version of the SDK. 

However, the inclusion of Docker and the utility scripts provides a different perspective about the environment on which the integration tests are executed.
In this version, the integration tests are run against the dockerised environment defined using Docker and Docker compose. By doing so, the integration test
environment can be more similar to a real one, including whatever other service is required for a full featured integration test execution. 

### Support for Alfresco 6.2.x

Alfresco SDK 4.1 provides support for Alfresco 6.2.x.

## Getting started with Alfresco SDK {#gettingstarted}

Use these instructions to get started with using Alfresco SDK 4.1.

### Prerequisites
   
There are a number of software requirements for using Alfresco SDK 4.1:

* Java Development Kit (JDK) - Version 11
* Maven - Version 3.3
* Docker - Latest stable version
* JRebel (optional) for hot reloading of web resources, configuration, and classes
* HotSwap Agent (optional) for hot reloading of web resources, configuration, and classes

#### Java

ACS 6.0 is compiled and executed using Java 8, but it is highly recommended to work with ACS 6.1+ which uses Java 11.

1. Download [JDK 11](https://jdk.java.net/11/){:target="_blank"}, unzip it and configure it as the default Java installation.

2. Verify the installation for both JDK and JRE.

    ```bash
    $ javac -version
    javac 11.0.1
    
    $ java -version
    openjdk version "11.0.1" 2018-10-16
    OpenJDK Runtime Environment 18.9 (build 11.0.1+13)
    OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM 18.9 (build 11.0.1+13, mixed mode)
    ```

3. Make sure JAVA_HOME is setup correctly, so other tools like Maven will use the correct version.

    ```bash
    $ env|grep JAVA_HOME
    JAVA_HOME=/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk-11.0.1.jdk/Contents/Home
    ```

#### Maven

Alfresco recommends that you keep up-to-date with all the Maven releases. Linux distributions and package managers tend to bundle older releases and this is 
the most common pitfall.

Alfresco SDK 4.1 requires Maven 3.3.0+, but you are recommended to download the latest version.

1. Download and install [Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi){:target="_blank"} and make sure it is configured correctly on your path.

2. Verify the installation.

    ```bash
    $ mvn -v
    Apache Maven 3.3.9 (bb52d8502b132ec0a5a3f4c09453c07478323dc5; 2015-11-10T17:41:47+01:00)
    Maven home: /usr/local/Cellar/maven/3.3.9/libexec
    Java version: 11.0.1, vendor: Oracle Corporation
    Java home: /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk-11.0.1.jdk/Contents/Home
    Default locale: en_ES, platform encoding: UTF-8
    OS name: "mac os x", version: "10.13.4", arch: "x86_64", family: "mac"
    ```

#### Docker

Alfresco recommends that you keep up-to-date with all the Docker releases. If you're using an older version of Windows or Mac you'll have to use 
[Docker Toolbox](https://docs.docker.com/toolbox/){:target="_blank"} which has some known issues.

1. Download and install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/){:target="_blank"}.

2. Verify the installation of Docker.

    ```bash
    $ docker -v
    Docker version 18.06.1-ce, build e68fc7a
    ``` 

3. [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/){:target="_blank"} is included as part of some Docker installers. If it's not part of your installation, then install it separately after you've installed Docker.

4. Verify the installation of Docker Compose.

    ```bash
    $ docker-compose -v
    docker-compose version 1.22.0, build f46880f
    ```

### Generate your project from the archetypes

1. After you've successfully configured Java and Maven, it's time to generate your project.

    ```bash
    mvn archetype:generate -Dfilter=org.alfresco:
    ```
    
    You'll be prompted to select the archetype you want. The previously available archetypes, `alfresco-amp-archetype` and `share-amp-archetype` will still show up 
    as an option, however these archetypes are not part of Alfresco SDK 4.1.
    
    Attention: You'll need double quotes around the filter part if you are using Windows Powershell: `mvn archetype:generate "-Dfilter=org.alfresco:"`.
    
    The output looks something like this:
    
    ```text
    [INFO] Generating project in Interactive mode
    [INFO] No archetype defined. Using maven-archetype-quickstart (org.apache.maven.archetypes:maven-archetype-quickstart:1.0)
    Choose archetype:
    1: remote -> org.alfresco.maven.archetype:alfresco-platform-jar-archetype (Sample project with full support for lifecycle and rapid development of Platform/Repository JARs and AMPs (Alfresco Module Packages))
    2: remote -> org.alfresco.maven.archetype:alfresco-share-jar-archetype (Share project with full support for lifecycle and rapid development of JARs and AMPs (Alfresco Module
            Packages))
    3: remote -> org.alfresco.maven.archetype:alfresco-allinone-archetype (Sample multi-module project for All-in-One development on the Alfresco platform. Includes modules for Platform/Repository JAR and Share JAR)
    ...
    ```

2. Select one of the following archetypes:

    * `org.alfresco.maven.archetype:alfresco-allinone-archetype`
    * `org.alfresco.maven.archetype:alfresco-platform-jar-archetype`
    * `org.alfresco.maven.archetype:alfresco-share-jar-archetype`

3. Choose the latest version, such as 4.1.0.

    ```bash
    Choose org.alfresco.maven.archetype:alfresco-allinone-archetype version:
    1: 2.0.0-beta-1
    2: 2.0.0-beta-2
    3: 2.0.0-beta-3
    4: 2.0.0-beta-4
    5: 2.0.0
    6: 2.1.0
    7: 2.1.1
    8: 2.2.0
    9: 3.0.0
    10: 3.0.1
    11: 4.0.0
    12: 4.1.0
    ```

4. Next you will be prompted for additional values, like `groupId`, `artifactId`, and `package`, as shown below:

    ```bash
    Define value for property 'groupId':
    Define value for property 'artifactId':
    [INFO] Using property: version = 1.0-SNAPSHOT
    Define value for property 'package':
    ```

5. After you have specified the information according to your project, a final confirmation will appear.

    ```bash
    Confirm properties configuration:
    groupId: com.acme
    artifactId: my-all-in-one
    version: 1.0-SNAPSHOT
    package: com.acme
    Y: :
    ```

6. Press **Y** and then press **Enter**.

    If everything has been configured correctly, you should see something similar to this:
    
    ```bash
    [INFO] ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
    [INFO] Using following parameters for creating project from Archetype: alfresco-allinone-archetype:4.1.0-SNAPSHOT

    ```

7. You have successfully generated your first SDK 4.1 project.

Inside the project, you will find the `run.bat` and `run.sh` scripts. These are convenience scripts for you to quickly compile / test / run your project.

In the terminal window, use:
* `./run.sh build_start` for Mac OS X or Linux.
* `run.bat build_start` for Windows.

If this is the first time you are doing this, it will take a while for Maven to download all the required dependencies and for Docker to download all the
required images.

For more information about how to work with the projects, please visit [Working with generated projects](#workingwithprojects).

## Alfresco SDK Maven archetypes {#mvnarchetypes}

The Alfresco SDK 4.1 comes with a number of Maven archetypes that can be used to generate Alfresco extension projects.

For more details, see [Getting started with Alfresco SDK 4.1](#gettingstarted).

These archetypes are available during the creation of a brand new project. In short, a [Maven archetype](https://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-archetypes.html){:target="_blank"} 
is a project templating toolkit. It's defined as an original pattern or model from which all other things of the same kind are made. Using archetypes 
provides a great way to enable developers to quickly follow best practice in a consistent way. This is valid for every project built with Apache Maven and 
it's valid in particular when using Alfresco SDK 4.1.

In this section we are going to introduce all the available archetypes in Alfresco SDK 4.1, with a brief description of their purpose and main use. 
After reading this information, you should be able to understand the various possibilities that Alfresco SDK 4.1 can offer to developers, in terms of 
projects.

When generating your project, you'll be prompted to select the Maven archetype you want to use through an interactive menu, similar to what you can see below.

```bash
[INFO] Generating project in Interactive mode
[INFO] No archetype defined. Using maven-archetype-quickstart (org.apache.maven.ar
chetypes:maven-archetype-quickstart:1.0)
Choose archetype:
1: remote -> org.alfresco.maven.archetype:activiti-jar-archetype (Sample project w
ith full support for lifecycle and rapid development of Activiti JARs)
2: remote -> org.alfresco.maven.archetype:alfresco-allinone-archetype (Sample mult
i-module project for All-in-One development on the Alfresco platform. Includes mod
ules for Platform/Repository JAR and Share JAR)
3: remote -> org.alfresco.maven.archetype:alfresco-amp-archetype (Sample project w
ith full support for lifecycle and rapid development of Repository AMPs (Alfresco 
Module Packages))
4: remote -> org.alfresco.maven.archetype:alfresco-platform-jar-archetype (Sample 
project with full support for lifecycle and rapid development of Platform/Reposit
ory JARs and AMPs (Alfresco Module Packages))
5: remote -> org.alfresco.maven.archetype:alfresco-share-jar-archetype (Share pro
ject with full support for lifecycle and rapid development of JARs and AMPs (Alfr
esco Module
Packages))
6: remote -> org.alfresco.maven.archetype:share-amp-archetype (Share project with 
full support for lifecycle and rapid development of AMPs (Alfresco Module
Packages))
Choose a number or apply filter (format: [groupId:]artifactId, case sensitive con
tains): : 
```

The menu shows 6 possible options, where each option corresponds to a different Maven archetype that you can select by using the listed numbers. 
Please note that the numbering is not sequential and some numbers may be skipped.

### org.alfresco.maven.archetype:alfresco-allinone-archetype

This archetype allows a developer to implement the All-In-One project on Content Services. The All-In-One project (also called AIO) is provided in 
this and previous versions of Alfresco SDK, but in SDK 4.1 it has been reshaped to leverage on Docker.

The All-In-One archetype allows a developer to create a multi-module project on Content Services. The All-In-One project mainly includes a module for 
the core repository in ACS and a module for the Share client. This includes:

* ACS Repository JAR
* Alfresco Share JAR
* ACS Repository Docker image configuration
* Alfresco Share Docker image configuration
* Integration tests
* Docker containers (ACS, Share, Alfresco Search Service, PostgreSQL) configuration and orchestration via Docker compose
* (Optional) AMP deployment configuration (JAR is the recommended artifact type and the default)

The project created using the All-In-One Maven archetype includes some sample code (by default) to show you how to develop with the Content Services 
Repository and the Alfresco Share client. The samples included in the project are basic and straightforward, and can help you to take the first steps into 
Alfresco development.

The All-In-One project is recommended to be used if you have to develop a customization of the Content Services Repository together with 
customizations on Alfresco Share client. If your plan to develop a project on the Content Services Repository only, use the Platform JAR Maven 
archetype. If you plan to develop a project on the Alfresco Share client only, use the Share JAR Maven archetype.

For more information about the All-In-One project, see [All-In-One project structure](#structureaio).

### org.alfresco.maven.archetype:alfresco-platform-jar-archetype

This archetype allows a developer to implement the Platform JAR project on Content Services. It has been reshaped in SDK 4.1 to leverage on Docker.

The Platform JAR Maven archetype allows a developer to create a module on Content Services, in particular on the Repository side, and includes:

* ACS Repository JAR
* ACS Repository Docker image configuration
* Docker containers (ACS, Share (optional), Alfresco Search Service, PostgreSQL) configuration and orchestration via Docker compose
* (Optional) AMP deployment configuration (JAR is the recommended artifact type and the default)

The project created using the Platform JAR Maven archetype includes some sample code (by default) to show you how to develop with the Alfresco Content 
Services Repository. The samples included in the project are basic and straightforward, and can help you to take the first steps into Alfresco development.

The Platform JAR project is recommended to be used if you have to develop a customization of the Content Services Repository. If you also plan to 
develop a customization of the Alfresco Share client, use the All-In-One Maven archetype instead.

For more information about the Platform JAR project, see [Platform JAR project structure](#structureplatform).

### org.alfresco.maven.archetype:alfresco-share-jar-archetype

This archetype allows a developer to implement the Share JAR project on an Alfresco Share client. It has been reshaped in SDK 4.1 to leverage on Docker.

The Share JAR Maven archetype allows a developer to create a module on an Alfresco Share client, and includes:

* Alfresco Share JAR
* Alfresco Share Docker image configuration
* Docker containers (ACS, Share, Alfresco Search Service, PostgreSQL) configuration and orchestration via Docker compose
* (Optional) AMP deployment configuration (JAR is the recommended artifact type and the default)

The project created using the Share JAR Maven archetype includes some sample code (by default) to show you how to develop with the Alfresco Share client. 
The samples included in the project are basic and straightforward, and can help you to take the first steps into Alfresco development.

The Share JAR project is recommended to be used if you have to develop a customization of the Alfresco Share client. If you also plan to develop a 
customization of the Content Services Repository, use the All-In-One Maven archetype instead.

For more information about the Share JAR project, see [Share JAR project structure](#structureshare).

### org.alfresco.maven.archetype:activiti-jar-archetype (for use with SDK 2.2 only)

This Maven archetype is related to an older version of the Alfresco SDK and should not be used. For technical reasons this archetype can't be hidden and is 
still listed.

### org.alfresco.maven.archetype:alfresco-amp-archetype (for use with SDK 2.2 only)

This Maven archetype is related to an older version of the Alfresco SDK and should not be used. For technical reasons this archetype can't be hidden and is 
still listed.

### org.alfresco.maven.archetype:share-amp-archetype (for use with SDK 2.2 only)

This Maven archetype is related to an older version of the Alfresco SDK and should not be used. For technical reasons this archetype can't be hidden and is 
still listed.

## Working with generated projects {#workingwithprojects}

After generating a project using one of the Alfresco SDK 4.1 Maven archetypes, it is important to know how to build / run / test these projects.

The Alfresco Platform 6 [deployment]({% link content-services/6.2/install/containers/index.md %}){:target="_blank"} architecture is highly based on container technologies, specifically in Docker. 
Due to that, the projects generated using the Alfresco SDK 4.1 archetypes set up their local environment making an intensive use of Docker and Docker compose 
technologies.

If you're not familiar with these technologies, it is highly recommended visiting the [Docker documentation website](https://docs.docker.com){:target="_blank"}. This site offers
a great quantity of training resources about [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/){:target="_blank"} and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/gettingstarted/){:target="_blank"}.

Before continuing, make sure that you have read and completed the tasks in the [Getting started](#gettingstarted) tutorial.

* [Working with an All-In-One project](#workinaio)
* [Working with a Platform (Repository) JAR project](#workingplatform)
* [Working with a Share JAR project](#workingshare)

After generating your project, using one of the Maven archetypes, review the project structure. The directory structure and content of each folder and file 
can help you to understand how to start developing with the Alfresco SDK 4.1. 

The structure of the project and the purpose of the files it contains vary according to the [Maven archetype](#mvnarchetypes) used to generate the project 
itself. The following links provide detailed descriptions of the different project types.

* [All-In-One project structure](#structureaio)
* [Platform JAR project structure](#structureplatform)
* [Share JAR project structure](#structureshare)

### Run script {#workingwithrunscript}

All the projects generated using the Alfresco SDK 4.1 archetypes provide a utility script to work with the project. This script is `run.sh` for Unix systems
and `run.bat` for Windows systems.

The execution of this script must be followed by a parameter that dictates the task to be executed in the project. The list of available tasks is:

|Task|Description|
|----|-----------|
|`build_start` | Build the whole project, recreate the ACS and Share docker images, start the dockerised environment composed by ACS, Share, ASS and PostgreSQL and tail the logs of all the containers.|
|`build_start_it_supported` | Build the whole project including dependencies required for IT execution, recreate the ACS and Share docker images, start the dockerised environment composed by ACS, Share, ASS and PostgreSQL and tail the logs of all the containers.|
|`start` | Start the dockerised environment without building the project and tail the logs of all the containers.|
|`stop` | Stop the dockerised environment.|
|`purge` | Stop the dockerised environment and delete all the persistent data (docker volumes).|
|`tail` | Tail the logs of all the containers.|
|`reload_share` | Build the Share module, recreate the Share docker image and restart the Share container (not available in the Alfresco Platform JAR archetype).|
|`reload_acs` | Build the ACS module, recreate the ACS docker image and restart the ACS container (only available in the All-In-One archetype).|
|`build_test` | Build the whole project, recreate the ACS and Share docker images, start the dockerised environment, execute the integration tests from the `integration-tests` module and stop the environment.|
|`test` | Execute the integration tests (the environment must be already started).|

This utility script uses `mvn`, `docker` and `docker-compose` commands, so make sure you have properly installed Maven, Docker and Docker compose and you have 
configured them properly to be accessible in the path.

In the case of Maven, it is not necessary that the `mvn` executable is in the path if you've properly configured the environment variable `M2_HOME`. The script
looks for the `M2_HOME` environment variable to build the path to the `mvn` executable. 

### Working with an All-In-One (AIO) project {#workingaio}

Before you continue make sure that you have read and completed the tasks in the 
[Getting started](#gettingstarted) tutorial to generate an All-In-One (AIO) project, 
which means selecting the `org.alfresco.maven.archetype:alfresco-allinone-archetype` 
Maven archetype when generating the project. The following information assumes that 
the AIO project was generated with the name `my-all-in-one-project`.

#### Introduction

An AIO SDK project is used to build extensions for both [Content Services (ACS) Repository]({% link content-services/6.2/develop/repo-ext-points/index.md %}) 
and [Alfresco Share UI]({% link content-services/6.2/develop/share-ext-points/index.md %}). The runtime environment
for ACS is Docker so not only is this project building the source code for your extensions but also the 
custom Docker images for the Alfresco Repository and Alfresco Share. The custom Docker images includes the 
JARs, or AMPs, with your extension code. 

Looking into the generated AIO parent project we can see that we got a Docker Compose file (`my-all-in-one-project/docker/docker-compose.yml`) 
that will be used to build custom Docker images and run the project, one sub-project called `my-all-in-one-project-platform` that will be 
used to build Repository customizations, and one sub-project called `my-all-in-one-project-share` that can be used to build Alfresco Share UI customizations.

There are also the `my-all-in-one-project-platform-docker` and `my-all-in-one-project-share-docker` projects that are 
used to assemble (aggregate) all the Repository and Share extensions 
(there are usually more than one of each in a bigger project) and then build the custom Docker images with the 
extension(s) applied.

The Repository and Share extensions that are aggregated can either be extensions that you develop locally or extensions 
that are available in a Maven repository somewhere. 

#### Configuration properties

There are a number of properties that we can customize when we run the Alfresco SDK project.
These configuration properties are defined in the `my-all-in-one-project/pom.xml` project file.

The following table explains some of these properties:

| Name | Type | Default value | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ------------- | ----------- |
| alfresco.platform.version | `string` | 6.1.2-ga | The version of the ACS Repository (i.e. alfresco.war) that the Repository Extension should be applied to. This also specifies the version of the ACS Repository Docker Image that the custom built Repository image should be based on. See `my-all-in-one-project-platform-docker/src/main/docker/Dockerfile` |
| alfresco.share.version | `string` | 6.1.0-RC3 | The version of Alfresco Share (i.e. share.war) that the Share Extension should be applied to. This also specifies the version of the Alfresco Share Docker Image that the custom built Share image should be based on. See `my-all-in-one-project-share-docker/src/main/docker/Dockerfile`|
| docker.acs.image | `string` | alfresco/alfresco-content-repository-community | The name of the ACS Repository Docker image in Docker Hub. This changes if you switch to Enterprise Edition.|
| docker.share.image | `string` | alfresco/alfresco-share | The name of the Alfresco Share Docker image in Docker Hub. This changes if you switch to Enterprise Edition.|
| share.port | `number` | 8180 | The external port (i.e. outside container) for the Alfresco Share webapp.|
| share.debug.port | `number` | 9898 | The external port (i.e. outside container) for Alfresco Share remote debugging.|
| acs.host | `string` | my-all-in-one-project-acs | This is the name (host) that the ACS Repository is available at. This maps to the service name for the ACS Repository in the Docker Compose file `my-all-in-one-project/docker/docker-compose.yml`. The name is only useful for communication between containers on the default Docker network that is created. |
| acs.port | `number` | 8080 | The external port (i.e. outside container) for the ACS Repository.|
| acs.debug.port | `number` | 8888 | The external port (i.e. outside container) for ACS Repository remote debugging.|
| postgres.port | `number` | 5555 | The external port (i.e. outside container) for PostgreSQL database.|

When you first start out you don't need to change any of these properties, just use the defaults and try it out.

#### Building and running the project

The first thing you need to do before you can run anything is to build the custom ACS Docker images with the custom extensions.
We can build images and extensions at the same time as we start (run) the project by using the `./run.sh build_start` script 
(on Windows use the `run.bat build_start` script instead).

Note that if you have another Alfresco SDK project running, then you need to stop it first. Also, make sure that the 
following ports are free: 8180 (Share), 8080 (Alfresco Repo), 9898 (Share Debug), 8888 (Alfresco Repo Debug), 5555 (Postgres).
If you want to change the ports see the properties section of `my-all-in-one-project/pom.xml`. This project file also 
contains the versions of Alfresco Repository and Alfresco Share that will be used.  

```bash
$ cd my-all-in-one-project

``` 

The `./run.sh build_start` script will do the following:

* Stop anything running already with this project's Docker Compose file: `my-all-in-one-project/docker/docker-compose.yml` 
* Build the Repository and Share Extension JARs so we are sure to get the latest changes
* Assemble/Aggregate all Repository extension JARs into the `my-all-in-one-project/my-all-in-one-project-platform-docker/target/extensions` directory
* Assemble/Aggregate all Share extension JARs into the `my-all-in-one-project/my-all-in-one-project-share-docker/target/extensions` directory
* Create Docker Volumes for Repository (alf_data), Search index, and Database so data is persisted outside the containers
* Run the project via the Docker Compose file and instruct Docker Compose to build the custom Docker images first
* Tail the logs of all containers

This will build the following two Docker images:

```bash
$ docker image ls|more
REPOSITORY                                                       TAG                                          IMAGE ID            CREATED             SIZE

``` 

The different web applications should now be accessible:

* **ACS Repository**: http://localhost:8080/alfresco
* **ACS Share**: http://localhost:8180/share/ - login with admin/admin

#### Trying out the sample code

The AIO project has some sample extension code that you can try out. There is a one Repository extension and one Share extension 
that you can test to make sure the extension JARs have been applied properly.

The Repository extension is a Web Script that can be called with the following URL: `http://localhost:8080/alfresco/service/sample/helloworld`.
The source code for the Web Script is located here: `my-all-in-one-project/my-all-in-one-project-platform/src/main/resources/alfresco/extension/templates/webscripts/alfresco/tutorials` 
and here: `my-all-in-one-project/my-all-in-one-project-platform/src/main/java/ com/example/platformsample/HelloWorldWebScript.java`.

The Share extension is a custom Aikau page with a custom widget, you reach it with the following URL: `http://localhost:8180/share/page/hdp/ws/simple-page`.
The source code for the Page and Widget is located here: `my-all-in-one-project/my-all-in-one-project-share/src/main/resources/alfresco/web-extension/site-webscripts/com/example/pages` 
and here: `my-all-in-one-project/my-all-in-one-project-share/src/main/resources/META-INF/resources/my-all-in-one-project-share/js/tutorials/widgets`.

#### Looking inside the containers

Sometimes it's good to be able to look at what has actually been deployed in the containers. For example, how do I 
access the Repository container and list the custom Repository extension JARs that have been deployed? 

You can do that as follows:

First **Ctrl-C** out of the log tailing:

```bash 
my-all-in-one-project-acs_1       | 27-Mar-2019 07:26:23.893 INFO [main] org.apache.coyote.AbstractProtocol.start Starting ProtocolHandler ["http-nio-8080"]

my-all-in-one-project-acs_1       |  2019-03-27 07:26:24,304  INFO  [management.subsystems.ChildApplicationContextFactory] [http-nio-8080-exec-3] Starting 'Search' subsystem, ID: [Search, managed, solr6]
my-all-in-one-project-acs_1       |  2019-03-27 07:26:25,555  INFO  [management.subsystems.ChildApplicationContextFactory] [http-nio-8080-exec-3] Startup of 'Search' subsystem, ID: [Search, managed, solr6] complete
^CERROR: Aborting.
my-all-in-one-project mbergljung$ 
``` 

Then check the name of the ACS Repository container:

```bash 
$ docker container ls
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE                                                         COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS              PORTS                                                      NAMES

1f197e52b4f2        alfresco/alfresco-search-services:1.2.0                       "/bin/sh -c '$DIST_D…"   5 minutes ago       Up 5 minutes        0.0.0.0:8983->8983/tcp                                     docker_my-all-in-one-project-ass_1
4eff0cc9cc25        alfresco-share-my-all-in-one-project:development              "/usr/local/tomcat/s…"   5 minutes ago       Up 5 minutes        8000/tcp, 0.0.0.0:8180->8080/tcp, 0.0.0.0:9898->8888/tcp   docker_my-all-in-one-project-share_1
a7854ff16d72        postgres:9.6                                                  "docker-entrypoint.s…"   5 minutes ago       Up 5 minutes        0.0.0.0:5555->5432/tcp                                     docker_my-all-in-one-project-postgres_1
``` 

Then open up a shell into the ACS Repository container:

```bash
my-all-in-one-project mbergljung$ docker exec -it docker_my-all-in-one-project-acs_1 /bin/bash
[root@733867a70117 tomcat]# pwd
/usr/local/tomcat
[root@733867a70117 tomcat]# ls -l webapps/alfresco/WEB-INF/lib | grep "my-all"
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    17220 Mar 27 07:24 my-all-in-one-project-platform-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
[root@733867a70117 tomcat]# exit
exit
``` 

#### Updating extension code

So now you probably want to write some new code, or update the existing code, and see how that works with the containers running. 
What do you need to do, restart etc. First just update the code. For example, let's update the Repository Web Script 
to return a different message. Open up the `my-all-in-one-project/my-all-in-one-project-platform/src/main/resources/alfresco/extension/templates/webscripts/alfresco/tutorials/helloworld.get.html.ftl` 
file and change it to look as follows:

```text
Message: '${fromJS}' '${fromJava}' UPDATED!
``` 

To get this code update deployed we just have to run the following command in another console then where we are tailing the logs,
and stand in the directory where the `run.sh` script is located:

```bash
my-all-in-one-project mbergljung$ ./run.sh reload_acs
``` 

What this will do is the following:

* Kill the `my-all-in-one-project-acs` container 
* Remove the killed (stopped) `my-all-in-one-project-acs` container, so a new Docker image can be created with `development` tag
* Build the Repository extension JAR: `my-all-in-one-project/my-all-in-one-project-platform` 
* Copy the newly built Repository extension JAR over to the `my-all-in-one-project/my-all-in-one-project-platform-docker/target/extensions` where it will be picked up when the new Docker image is built.
* Build a new `alfresco-content-services-my-all-in-one-project:development` image
* Start up the `my-all-in-one-project-acs` container based on new image  

You will be left with the console tailing the logs, but you can **Ctrl-C** out of this as you are already tailing the logs 
in the initial console where we started things up.

You can now check if the change took effect by accessing the `http://localhost:8080/alfresco/service/sample/helloworld` Web Script.
 
#### Stopping the project

To stop the solution you need to first `Ctrl-C` out of the log tailing. This does not stop the containers 
as they run in daemon mode in the background. Check this by executing the following command that lists running containers:

```bash
$ docker container ls
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE                                                         COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS              PORTS                                                      NAMES

edb9ea129a5d        postgres:9.6                                                  "docker-entrypoint.s…"   20 minutes ago      Up 20 minutes       0.0.0.0:5555->5432/tcp                                     docker_my-all-in-one-project-postgres_1
6992d183986f        alfresco/alfresco-search-services:1.2.0                       "/bin/sh -c '$DIST_D…"   20 minutes ago      Up 20 minutes       0.0.0.0:8983->8983/tcp                                     docker_my-all-in-one-project-ass_1
107d00733efd        alfresco-share-my-all-in-one-project:development              "/usr/local/tomcat/s…"   20 minutes ago      Up 20 minutes       8000/tcp, 0.0.0.0:8180->8080/tcp, 0.0.0.0:9898->8888/tcp   docker_my-all-in-one-project-share_1
``` 

Now, standing in the directory where the `run.sh` script is located execute the following command to stop and remove the containers:

```bash
my-all-in-one-project mbergljung$ ./run.sh stop
Stopping docker_my-all-in-one-project-acs_1      ... done
Stopping docker_my-all-in-one-project-postgres_1 ... done

Removing docker_my-all-in-one-project-ass_1      ... done
Removing docker_my-all-in-one-project-share_1    ... done

``` 

### Working with Platform JAR project structure {#workingplatform}

Before you continue make sure that you have read and completed the tasks in the 
[Getting started](#gettingstarted) tutorial to generate a Platform project, 
which means selecting the `org.alfresco.maven.archetype:alfresco-platform-jar-archetype` 
Maven archetype when generating the project. The following information assumes that 
the Platform project was generated with the name `my-platform-project`.

#### Introduction

A Platform project is used to build extensions for the [Content Services (ACS) Repository]({% link content-services/6.2/develop/repo-ext-points/index.md %}). 
The runtime environment for ACS is Docker so not only is this project building the source code for your extensions but also the 
custom Docker image for the Alfresco Repository. The custom Docker images includes the JARs, or AMPs, with your extension code. 

Looking into the generated Platform project we can see that we got a Docker Compose file (`my-platform-project/docker/docker-compose.yml`) 
that will be used to build custom Docker images and run the project. We also got a directory for our extension source code: 
`my-platform-project/src/main/java` and one directory with the Docker related stuff, such as the `Dockerfile` used to 
build the custom ACS Repository Docker image: `my-platform-project/src/main/docker`.

#### Configuration properties

There are a number of properties that we can customize when we run the Alfresco SDK project.
These configuration properties are defined in the `my-platform-project/pom.xml` project file.

The following table explains some of these properties:

| Name | Type | Default value | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ------------- | ----------- |
| alfresco.platform.version | `string` | 6.1.2-ga | The version of the ACS Repository (i.e. alfresco.war) that the Repository Extension should be applied to. This also specifies the version of the ACS Repository Docker Image that the custom built Repository image should be based on. See `my-platform-project-platform-docker/src/main/docker/Dockerfile` |
| alfresco.share.version | `string` | 6.1.0-RC3 | The version of Alfresco Share (i.e. share.war) that the Share Extension should be applied to. This also specifies the version of the Alfresco Share Docker Image that the custom built Share image should be based on. See `my-platform-project-share-docker/src/main/docker/Dockerfile`|
| docker.acs.image | `string` | alfresco/alfresco-content-repository-community | The name of the ACS Repository Docker image in Docker Hub. This changes if you switch to Enterprise Edition.|
| docker.share.image | `string` | alfresco/alfresco-share | The name of the Alfresco Share Docker image in Docker Hub. This changes if you switch to Enterprise Edition.|
| share.port | `number` | 8180 | The external port (i.e. outside container) for the Alfresco Share webapp.|
| share.debug.port | `number` | 9898 | The external port (i.e. outside container) for Alfresco Share remote debugging.|
| acs.host | `string` | my-platform-project-acs | This is the name (host) that the ACS Repository is available at. This maps to the service name for the ACS Repository in the Docker Compose file `my-platform-project/docker/docker-compose.yml`. The name is only useful for communication between containers on the default Docker network that is created. |
| acs.port | `number` | 8080 | The external port (i.e. outside container) for the ACS Repository.|
| acs.debug.port | `number` | 8888 | The external port (i.e. outside container) for ACS Repository remote debugging.|
| postgres.port | `number` | 5555 | The external port (i.e. outside container) for PostgreSQL database.|

There are some Alfresco Share related properties listed here, but they are not used unless you uncomment some code in the 
Docker Compose file (`my-platform-project/docker/docker-compose.yml`) to run the Alfresco Share container.

When you first start out you don't need to change any of these properties, just use the defaults and try it out.

#### Building and running the project

The first thing you need to do before you can run anything is to build the custom ACS Repository Docker image with the custom extensions.
We can build the image and extensions at the same time as we start (run) the project by using the `./run.sh build_start` script 
(on Windows use the `run.bat build_start` script instead).

Note that if you have another Alfresco SDK project running, then you need to stop it first. Also, make sure that the 
following ports are free: 8180 (Share - if enabled in Docker Compose), 8080 (Alfresco Repo), 9898 (Share Debug - if enabled in Docker Compose), 
8888 (Alfresco Repo Debug), 5555 (Postgres).
If you want to change the ports see the properties section of `my-platform-project/pom.xml`. This project file also 
contains the versions of Alfresco Repository and Alfresco Share (if enabled) that will be used.  

```bash

```

The `./run.sh build_start` script will do the following:

* Stop anything running already with this project's Docker Compose file: `my-platform-project/docker/docker-compose.yml` 
* Build the Repository Extension JARs so we are sure to get the latest changes
* Assemble/Aggregate all Repository extension JARs into the `my-platform-project/target/extensions` directory
* Create Docker Volumes for Repository (alf_data), Search index, and Database so data is persisted outside the containers
* Run the project via the Docker Compose file and instruct Docker Compose to build the custom Docker images first
* Tail the logs of all containers

This will build the following Docker image:

```bash 
$ docker image ls|more
REPOSITORY                                                       TAG                                          IMAGE ID            CREATED             SIZE

``` 

The different web applications should now be accessible:

* **ACS Repository**: http://localhost:8080/alfresco
* And optionally (if enabled in Docker Compose file) **ACS Share**: http://localhost:8180/share/ - login with admin/admin

#### Trying out the sample code

The Platform project has some sample extension code that you can try out. 

The Repository extension is a Web Script that can be called with the following URL: `http://localhost:8080/alfresco/service/sample/helloworld`.
The source code for the Web Script is located here: `my-platform-project/src/main/resources/alfresco/extension/templates/webscripts/alfresco/tutorials` 
and here: `my-platform-project/src/main/java/ com/example/platformsample/HelloWorldWebScript.java`.

#### Looking inside the containers

Sometimes it's good to be able to look at what has actually been deployed in the containers. For example, how do I 
access the Repository container and list the custom Repository extension JARs that have been deployed? 

You can do that as follows:

First **Ctrl-C** out of the log tailing:

``` 

Then check the name of the ACS Repository container:

```bash 
$ docker container ls
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE                                                       COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS              PORTS                                            NAMES

c9145e7cdb20        postgres:9.6                                                "docker-entrypoint.s…"   8 minutes ago       Up 8 minutes        0.0.0.0:5555->5432/tcp                           docker_my-platform-project-postgres_1
``` 

Then open up a shell into the ACS Repository container:

```bash 
my-platform-project mbergljung$ docker exec -it docker_my-platform-project-acs_1 /bin/bash
[root@ba90b1648470 tomcat]# pwd
/usr/local/tomcat
[root@ba90b1648470 tomcat]# ls -l webapps/alfresco/WEB-INF/lib | grep "my-plat"
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    21180 Mar 27 09:23 my-platform-project-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    13692 Mar 27 09:23 my-platform-project-1.0-SNAPSHOT-tests.jar
[root@ba90b1648470 tomcat]# exit
exit
``` 

#### Updating extension code

So now you probably want to write some new code, or update the existing code, and see how that works with the containers running. 
What do you need to do, restart etc. First just update the code. For example, let's update the Repository Web Script 
to return a different message. Open up the `my-platform-project/src/main/resources/alfresco/extension/templates/webscripts/alfresco/tutorials/helloworld.get.html.ftl` 
file and change it to look as follows:

```text 
Message: '${fromJS}' '${fromJava}' UPDATED!
``` 

To get this code update deployed we have to run the following commands:

First `Ctrl-C` out of the log tailing.

Then stop the project:

```bash 
my-platform-project mbergljung$ ./run.sh stop
Stopping docker_my-platform-project-acs_1      ... done
Stopping docker_my-platform-project-ass_1      ... done
Stopping docker_my-platform-project-postgres_1 ... done
Removing docker_my-platform-project-acs_1      ... done
Removing docker_my-platform-project-ass_1      ... done
Removing docker_my-platform-project-postgres_1 ... done
Removing network docker_default
``` 

Now build and start again:

```bash
my-platform-project mbergljung$ ./run.sh build_start
...
``` 

What this will do is the following:

* Kill the `my-platform-project-acs` container 
* Removed the killed (stopped) `my-platform-project-acs` container, so a new Docker image can be created with `development` tag
* Build the Repository extension JAR
* Copy the newly built Repository extension JAR over to the `my-platform-project/target/extensions` where it will be picked up when the new Docker image is built.
* Build a new `alfresco-content-services-my-platform-project:development` image
* Start up the `my-platform-project-acs` container based on new image  

You can now check if the change took effect by accessing the `http://localhost:8080/alfresco/service/sample/helloworld` Web Script.
 
#### Stopping the project

To stop the solution you need to first `Ctrl-C` out of the log tailing. This does not stop the containers 
as they run in daemon mode in the background. Check this by executing the following command that lists running containers:

```bash
$ docker container ls
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE                                                       COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS              PORTS                                            NAMES
61de829092f3        alfresco-content-services-my-platform-project:development   "catalina.sh run -se…"   3 minutes ago       Up 3 minutes        0.0.0.0:8080->8080/tcp, 0.0.0.0:8888->8888/tcp   docker_my-platform-project-acs_1
07300ddb6714        alfresco/alfresco-search-services:1.2.0                     "/bin/sh -c '$DIST_D…"   3 minutes ago       Up 3 minutes        0.0.0.0:8983->8983/tcp                           docker_my-platform-project-ass_1
09922ce36d90        postgres:9.6                                                "docker-entrypoint.s…"   3 minutes ago       Up 3 minutes        0.0.0.0:5555->5432/tcp                           docker_my-platform-project-postgres_1
``` 

Now, standing in the directory where the `run.sh` script is located execute the following command to stop and remove the containers:

```bash 
my-platform-project mbergljung$ ./run.sh stop
Stopping docker_my-platform-project-acs_1      ... done
Stopping docker_my-platform-project-ass_1      ... done
Stopping docker_my-platform-project-postgres_1 ... done
Removing docker_my-platform-project-acs_1      ... done
Removing docker_my-platform-project-ass_1      ... done
Removing docker_my-platform-project-postgres_1 ... done
Removing network docker_default
``` 

### Working with Share JAR project structure {#workingshare}

Before you continue make sure that you have read and completed the tasks in the 
[Getting started](#gettingstarted) tutorial to generate an Alfresco Share project, 
which means selecting the `org.alfresco.maven.archetype:alfresco-share-jar-archetype` 
Maven archetype when generating the project. The following information assumes that 
the Share project was generated with the name `my-share-project`.

#### Introduction

An Alfresco Share project is used to build extensions for [Alfresco Share UI]({% link content-services/6.2/develop/share-ext-points/index.md %}). 
The runtime environment for ACS is Docker so not only is this project building the source code for your extensions but also the 
custom Docker image for Alfresco Share. The custom Docker images includes the 
JARs, or AMPs, with your extension code. 

Looking into the generated Share project we can see that we got a Docker Compose file (`my-share-project/docker/docker-compose.yml`) 
that will be used to build custom Docker images and run the project. We also got a directory for our extension source code: 
`my-share-project/src/main/java` and one directory with the Docker related stuff, such as the `Dockerfile` used to 
build the custom Alfresco Share Docker image: `my-share-project/src/main/docker`.

#### Configuration properties

There are a number of properties that we can customize when we run the Alfresco SDK project.
These configuration properties are defined in the `my-share-project/pom.xml` project file.

The following table explains some of these properties:

| Name | Type | Default value | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ------------- | ----------- |
| alfresco.platform.version | `string` | 6.1.2-ga | The version of the ACS Repository (i.e. alfresco.war) that the Repository Extension should be applied to. This also specifies the version of the ACS Repository Docker Image that the custom built Repository image should be based on. See `my-share-project-platform-docker/src/main/docker/Dockerfile` |
| alfresco.share.version | `string` | 6.1.0-RC3 | The version of Alfresco Share (i.e. share.war) that the Share Extension should be applied to. This also specifies the version of the Alfresco Share Docker Image that the custom built Share image should be based on. See `my-share-project-share-docker/src/main/docker/Dockerfile`|
| docker.acs.image | `string` | alfresco/alfresco-content-repository-community | The name of the ACS Repository Docker image in Docker Hub. This changes if you switch to Enterprise Edition.|
| docker.share.image | `string` | alfresco/alfresco-share | The name of the Alfresco Share Docker image in Docker Hub. This changes if you switch to Enterprise Edition.|
| share.port | `number` | 8180 | The external port (i.e. outside container) for the Alfresco Share webapp.|
| share.debug.port | `number` | 9898 | The external port (i.e. outside container) for Alfresco Share remote debugging.|
| acs.host | `string` | my-share-project-acs | This is the name (host) that the ACS Repository is available at. This maps to the service name for the ACS Repository in the Docker Compose file `my-share-project/docker/docker-compose.yml`. The name is only useful for communication between containers on the default Docker network that is created. |
| acs.port | `number` | 8080 | The external port (i.e. outside container) for the ACS Repository.|
| acs.debug.port | `number` | 8888 | The external port (i.e. outside container) for ACS Repository remote debugging.|
| postgres.port | `number` | 5555 | The external port (i.e. outside container) for PostgreSQL database.|

There are some ACS Repository related properties listed here, such as `acs.host` and `acs.port`. Alfresco Share will use those
to connect to the Alfresco Repository. This is however a bit tricky when we are running in a container environment. You cannot
just start the Repository and make it available on `localhost:8080`. It would not be accessible like that from inside the 
Share container. For Share to be able to connect to the Repository both containers need to be attached to the same 
Docker Network. This way you can just use the Docker Compose service name for the Repository, such as `my-share-project-acs`.
So the best way to test your Share extension is to uncomment the code in the Docker Compose file 
(`my-share-project/docker/docker-compose.yml`) to also run the ACS Repository container, Search, and Postgres.

#### Building and running the project

The first thing you need to do before you can run anything is to build the custom Share Docker image with the custom extensions.
We can build the image and extensions at the same time as we start (run) the project by using the `./run.sh build_start` script 
(on Windows use the `run.bat build_start` script instead).

Note that if you have another Alfresco SDK project running, then you need to stop it first. Also, make sure that the 
following ports are free: 8180 (Share), 8080 (Alfresco Repo - if enabled in Docker Compose), 9898 (Share Debug), 8888 (Alfresco Repo Debug - if enabled), 5555 (Postgres).
If you want to change the ports see the properties section of `my-share-project/pom.xml`. This project file also 
contains the versions of Alfresco Repository (if enabled) and Alfresco Share that will be used.  

When I run the project I have uncommented the code (make sure to also remove the "# Optional" line) that starts 
the Repository, Search, and PostgresSQL in the (`my-share-project/docker/docker-compose.yml`) file, so I can test the Share extension:  

```bash
$ cd my-share-project
my-share-project mbergljung$ ./run.sh build_start

``` 

The `./run.sh build_start` script will do the following:

* Stop anything running already with this project's Docker Compose file: `my-share-project/docker/docker-compose.yml` 
* Build the Share Extension JARs so we are sure to get the latest changes
* Assemble/Aggregate all Share extension JARs into the `my-share-project/target/extensions` directory
* Create Docker Volumes for Repository (alf_data), Search index, and Database so data is persisted outside the containers
* Run the project via the Docker Compose file and instruct Docker Compose to build the custom Docker images first
* Tail the logs of all containers

This will build the following Docker image:

```bash 
$ docker image ls
REPOSITORY                                                       TAG                                          IMAGE ID            CREATED              SIZE
alfresco-share-my-share-project                                  development                                  b8b9acdb3425        About a minute ago   749MB
``` 

The different web applications should now be accessible:

* **ACS Repository**: http://localhost:8080/alfresco
* **ACS Share**: http://localhost:8180/share/ - login with admin/admin

#### Trying out the sample code

The Share project has some sample extension code that you can try out. 

The Share extension is a custom Aikau page with a custom widget, you reach it with the following URL: `http://localhost:8180/share/page/hdp/ws/simple-page`.
The source code for the Page and Widget is located here: `my-share-project/src/main/resources/alfresco/web-extension/site-webscripts/com/example/pages` 
and here: `my-share-project/src/main/resources/META-INF/resources/my-share-project-share/js/tutorials/widgets`.

#### Looking inside the containers

Sometimes it's good to be able to look at what has actually been deployed in the containers. For example, how do I 
access the Share container and list the custom Share extension JARs that have been deployed? 

You can do that as follows:

First **Ctrl-C** out of the log tailing:

```text 
my-share-project-acs_1       | 27-Mar-2019 10:09:01.213 INFO [main] org.apache.catalina.startup.Catalina.start Server startup in 95189 ms

^CERROR: Aborting.
my-share-project mbergljung$ 
``` 

Then check the name of the Alfresco Share container:

```bash 
$ docker container ls
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE                                                     COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS              PORTS                                                      NAMES

92902d7ae624        alfresco/alfresco-search-services:1.2.0                   "/bin/sh -c '$DIST_D…"   6 minutes ago       Up 6 minutes        0.0.0.0:8983->8983/tcp                                     docker_my-share-project-ass_1
``` 

Then open up a shell into the Alfresco Share container:

```bash 
my-share-project mbergljung$ docker exec -it docker_my-share-project-share_1 /bin/bash
[root@2b4fa4b4a3f6 tomcat]# pwd
/usr/local/tomcat
[root@2b4fa4b4a3f6 tomcat]# ls -l webapps/share/WEB-INF/lib/ | grep "my-sh"
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    18920 Mar 27 10:07 my-share-project-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
[root@2b4fa4b4a3f6 tomcat]# exit
exit
``` 

#### Updating extension code

So now you probably want to write some new code, or update the existing code, and see how that works with the containers running. 
What do you need to do, restart etc. First just update the code. For example, let's update the Share Page title. 
Open up the `my-share-project/src/main/resources/alfresco/web-extension/site-webscripts/com/example/pages/simple-page.get.js` 
file and change it to look as follows:

```json 
model.jsonModel = {
    widgets: [{
        id: "SET_PAGE_TITLE",
        name: "alfresco/header/SetTitle",
        config: {
            title: "This is an UPDATED PAGE Title"
        }
    },
        {
            id: "MY_HORIZONTAL_WIDGET_LAYOUT",
            name: "alfresco/layout/HorizontalWidgets",
            config: {
                widgetWidth: 50,
                widgets: [
                    {
                        id: "DEMO_SIMPLE_LOGO",
                        name: "alfresco/logo/Logo",
                        config: {
                            logoClasses: "alfresco-logo-only"
                        }
                    },
                    {
                        id: "DEMO_SIMPLE_MSG",
                        name: "tutorials/widgets/TemplateWidget"
                    }
                ]
            }
        }]
};
``` 

To get this code update deployed we just have to run the following command in another console then where we are tailing the logs,
and stand in the directory where the `run.sh` script is located:

```bash 
my-share-project mbergljung$ ./run.sh reload_share
``` 

What this will do is the following:

* Kill the `my-share-project-acs` container 
* Remove the killed (stopped) `my-share-project-acs` container, so a new Docker image can be created with `development` tag
* Build the Share extension JAR
* Copy the newly built Share extension JAR over to the `my-share-project/target/extensions` where it will be picked up when the new Docker image is built.
* Build a new `alfresco-share-my-share-project:development` image
* Start up the `my-share-project-acs` container based on new image  

You will be left with the console tailing the logs, but you can **Ctrl-C** out of this as you are already tailing the logs 
in the initial console where we started things up.

You can now check if the change took effect by accessing the `http://localhost:8180/share/page/hdp/ws/simple-page` Web Script.
 
#### Stopping the project

To stop the solution you need to first `Ctrl-C` out of the log tailing. This does not stop the containers 
as they run in daemon mode in the background. Check this by executing the following command that lists running containers:

```bash 
$ docker container ls

### All-In-One (AIO) project structure {#structureaio}

This page provides a detailed description of the All-In-One (AIO) project, including the project structure and folder contents.

Now that you know what an All-In-One project is, let’s introduce the structure of the project, once it is created using the 
`org.alfresco.maven.archetype:alfresco-allinone-archetype`.

Below is an example directory structure of an All-In-One project created with `com.example` as `groupId` and `my-all-in-one-project` as `artifactId`.

From a high level standpoint, we can describe the content of the project as follows:

* `my-all-in-one-project` (the root of the project) contains the whole project. It can easily be pushed into a version control repository and/or an internet hosting service like GitHub, SVN, CVS, etc.
* The files stored into the root of the project are mainly related to actions and commands (running, debugging, etc.), technical configuration (`pom.xml`), and documentation (`README.md`).
* `my-all-in-one-project-integration-tests` (typically named `<artefactId-integration-tests>`) contains a sub-project entirely dedicated to integration tests.
* `my-all-in-one-project-platform-docker` (typically named `<artefactId-platform-docker>`) contains a sub-project dedicated to the configuration of a custom Docker image with the Content Services Repository and the customization module `my-all-in-one-project-platform` installed.
* `my-all-in-one-project-platform` (typically named `<artefactId-platform>`) contains a sub-project entirely dedicated to the customization of the Content Services Repository.
* `my-all-in-one-project-share-docker` (typically named `<artefactId-share-docker>`) contains a sub-project dedicated to the configuration of a custom Docker image with the Alfresco Share client and the customization module `my-all-in-one-project-share` installed.
* `my-all-in-one-project-share` (typically named `<artefactId-share>`) contains a sub-project entirely dedicated to the customization of the Alfresco Share client.

After this brief introduction of the All-In-One project, let’s focus on the content of the folders.

#### Project root folder

Below is a description of the files in the root of the project (in this case, `my-all-in-one-project`).

|File | Description|
|--- | ---|
|`run` (`sh` and `bat`) | Utility script to work with the project (compile, run, test, show logs, etc.). [More details about the run script](#workingwithrunscript).|
|`pom.xml` | This XML file contains information about the project and configuration details used by Apache Maven to build the project. You can define all the configurations, parameters, and settings in this file for projects as well as for sub-projects.|
|`README.md` | File in Markdown format containing the documentation for the project.|

#### my-all-in-one-project-platform

Below is a description of the content in the `my-all-in-one-project-platform` (typically named `<artefactId-platform>`) sub-project. This sub-project 
contains the source code entirely dedicated to the customizing the Content Services Repository.

|Content | Description|
|--- | ---|
|`pom.xml` | This XML file contains information about the project and configuration details used by Apache Maven to build the project. You can define all the configurations, parameters, and settings in this file even if it depends on the parent pom in the root folder. For the majority of use cases, settings and configurations are directly inherited from the parent pom, and this file can work in its default version.|
|`src/main/assembly` | In this folder you can find everything that's needed to fully control creating the AMP artifact in the platform project. The main file to check is `amp.xml`.|
|`src/main/java/<groupId>...` | This folder contains the same content you can find in a regular Java project, i.e. the Java source code. Here you should put all the custom classes, interfaces, and Java source code in general.|
|`src/main/resources/alfresco/extension/templates/webscripts` | In this folder you can find the extensions to the REST API related to Web Scripts . Repository Web Scripts are defined in XML, JavaScript, and FreeMarker files. These are referred to as Data Web Scripts as they usually return JSON or XML. The default project contains a Hello World example.|
|`src/main/resources/alfresco/module/<artifactId>` | This folder contains all the configuration files and settings for the Alfresco platform module. Here you can find context files, the `alfresco-global.properties` file, Content Model examples, and Activiti workflow examples.|
|`src/main/resources/META-INF` | This folder hosts the content that will be placed in the `META-INF` folder of a standard Java web application.|
|`src/test/java/<groupId>...` | This folder contains the same content you can find in a regular Java project, i.e. the Java source code for tests. Here you should put all the custom classes, interfaces, and Java source code related to tests.|

#### my-all-in-one-project-platform-docker

Below is a description of the content in the `my-all-in-one-project-platform-docker` (typically named `<artefactId-platform-docker>`) sub-project. This 
sub-project contains the resources required to define a custom Docker image with the Content Services Repository and the customization module 
`my-all-in-one-project-platform` installed.

Content | Description
--- | ---
`pom.xml` | This XML file contains information about the project and configuration details used by Apache Maven to build the project. It adds the dependency to the `my-all-in-one-project-platform` module and configures the `maven-dependency-plugin` to copy all the artifacts required in the Docker image into the folder `${project.build.directory}/extensions`.
`src/main/docker` | In this folder you can find everything that's needed to fully configure the custom ACS Docker image.
`src/main/docker/Dockerfile` | This is the file that define the custom ACS Docker image. The default configuration installs all the existing JARs and AMPs under `${project.build.directory}/extensions` folder and adds custom configuration and license files.
`src/main/docker/license` | This folder contains the licenses required for running an Enterprise project.

#### my-all-in-one-project-share

Below is a description of the content in the `my-all-in-one-project-share` (typically named `<artefactId-share>`) sub-project. This sub-project 
contains the source code entirely dedicated to the customizing the Alfresco Share client.

Content | Description
--- | ---
`pom.xml` | This XML file contains information about the project and configuration details used by Apache Maven to build the project. You can define all the configurations, parameters, and settings in this file even if it depends on the parent pom in the root folder.

`src/main/resources/alfresco/module/<artifactId>` | This folder contains all the configuration files and settings for the Alfresco Share module. Here you can find the property file for the module.
`src/main/resources/alfresco/web-extension` | In this folder you can find the extensions to the web client (Alfresco Share) and it's where you store Spring configurations that extend and override the system Share configuration. There are two important sub-directories here: `site-data` and `site-webscripts`.
`src/main/resources/alfresco/META-INF/resources` | This folder hosts the content that will be placed in the `META-INF` folder of a standard Java web application. It is best practice to use a further subdirectory based on the module name. This allows you to manage multiple modules, so that their web resources don't conflict with each other.
`src/main/resources/alfresco/META-INF/share-config-custom.xml` | This file is a relevant Alfresco Share file used to configure the sub-project with the correct settings, depending on your environment. For more details, see [Share configuration]({% link content-services/6.2/develop/share-ext-points/index.md %}).
`src/test/java/<groupId>...` | This folder contains the same content you can find in a regular Java project, i.e. the Java source code for tests. Here you should put all the custom classes, interfaces, and Java source code related to tests.

From a high level standpoint, we can describe the content of the project as follows:

* `my-platform-jar-project` (the root of the project) contains the whole project. It can easily be pushed into a version control repository and/or an internet hosting service like GitHub, SVN, CVS, etc.
* The files stored into the root of the project are mainly related to actions and commands (running, debugging, etc.), technical configuration (`pom.xml`), and documentation (`README.md`).
* `src` contains the source code, tests, configurations, settings and resources that are entirely dedicated to the customization of the Content Services Repository.

After this brief introduction of the Platform JAR project, let’s focus on the content of the folders.

#### Project root folder

Below is a description of the files in the root of the project (in this case, `my-platform-jar-project`).

File | Description
--- | ---
`run` (`sh` and `bat`) | Utility script to work with the project (compile, run, test, show logs, etc.). [More details about the run script](#workingwithrunscript).
`pom.xml` | This XML file contains information about the project and configuration details used by Apache Maven to build the project.
`README.md` | File in Markdown format containing the documentation for the project.

#### `src` folder

Below is a description of the content in the `src` folder. This folder contains the source code, tests, configuration, settings, and resources entirely 
dedicated to the customization of the Content Services Repository.

Content | Description
--- | ---
`src/main/assembly` | In this folder you can find everything that's needed to fully control creating the AMP artifact in the platform project. The main file to check is `amp.xml`.
`src/main/docker` | In this folder you can find everything that's needed to fully configure the custom ACS Docker image.
`src/main/docker/Dockerfile` | This is the file that define the custom ACS Docker image. The default configuration installs all the existing JARs and AMPs under `${project.build.directory}/extensions` folder and adds custom configuration and license files.
`src/main/docker/license` | This folder contains the licenses required for running an Enterprise project.
`src/main/java/<groupId>...` | This folder contains the same content you can find in a regular Java project, i.e. the Java source code. Here you should put all the custom classes, interfaces, and Java source code in general.
`src/main/resources/alfresco/extension/templates/webscripts` | In this folder you can find the extensions to the REST API related to Web Scripts . Repository Web Scripts are defined in XML, JavaScript, and FreeMarker files. These are referred to as Data Web Scripts as they usually return JSON or XML. The default project contains a Hello World example.
`src/main/resources/alfresco/module/<artifactId>` | This folder contains all the configuration files and settings for the Alfresco platform module. Here you can find context files, the `alfresco-global.properties` file, Content Model examples, and Activiti workflow examples.
`src/main/resources/META-INF` | This folder hosts the content that will be placed in the `META-INF` folder of a standard Java web application.
`src/test/java/<groupId>...` | This folder contains the same content you can find in a regular Java project, i.e. the Java source code for tests. Here you should put all the custom classes, interfaces, and Java source code related to tests.

### Share JAR project structure {#structureshare}

The following page provides a detailed description of the Share client JAR project, including the project structure and folder content.

Now that you know what a Share JAR project is, let’s introduce the structure of the project, once it is created using the 
`org.alfresco.maven.archetype:alfresco-share-jar-archetype`.

Below is an example directory structure of a Share JAR created with `com.example` as `groupId` and `my-share-jar-project` as `artifactId`.

From a high level standpoint, we can describe the content of the project as follows:

* `my-platform-jar-project` (the root of the project) contains the whole project. It can easily be pushed into a version control repository and/or an internet hosting service like GitHub, SVN, CVS, etc.
* The files stored into the root of the project are mainly related to actions and commands (running, debugging, etc.), technical configuration (`pom.xml`), and documentation (`README.md`).
* `src` contains the source code, tests, configurations, settings and resources that are entirely dedicated to the customization of the Alfresco Share client.

After this brief introduction of the Platform JAR project, let’s focus on the content of the folders.

#### Project root folder

Below is a description of the files in the root of the project (in this case, `my-share-jar-project`).

File | Description
--- | ---
`run` (`sh` and `bat`) | Utility script to work with the project (compile, run, test, show logs, etc.). [More details about the run script](#workingwithrunscript).
`pom.xml` | This XML file contains information about the project and configuration details used by Apache Maven to build the project.
`README.md` | File in Markdown format containing the documentation for the project.

#### `src` folder

Below is a description of the content in the `src` folder, which contains the source code, tests, configuration, settings, and resources entirely dedicated to 
the customization of the Alfresco Share client.

Content | Description
--- | ---
`src/main/assembly` | In this folder you can find everything that's needed to fully control creating the AMP artifact in the platform project. The main file to check is `amp.xml`.
`src/main/docker` | In this folder you can find everything that's needed to fully configure the custom Alfresco Share Docker image.
`src/main/docker/Dockerfile` | This is the file that define the custom Alfresco Share Docker image. The default configuration installs all the existing JARs and AMPs under `${project.build.directory}/extensions` folder and adds custom configuration files.
`src/main/java/<groupId>...` | This folder contains the same content you can find in a regular Java project, i.e. the Java source code. Here you should put all the custom classes, interfaces, and Java source code in general.
`src/main/resources/alfresco/module/<artifactId>` | This folder contains all the configuration files and settings for the Alfresco Share module. Here you can find the property file for the module.
`src/main/resources/alfresco/web-extension` | In this folder you can find the extensions to the web client (Alfresco Share) and it's where you store Spring configurations that extend and override the system Share configuration. There are two important sub-directories here: `site-data` and `site-webscripts`.
`src/main/resources/alfresco/META-INF/resources` | This folder hosts the content that will be placed in the `META-INF` folder of a standard Java web application. It is best practice to use a further subdirectory based on the module name. This allows you to manage multiple modules, so that their web resources don't conflict with each other.
`src/main/resources/alfresco/META-INF/share-config-custom.xml` | This file is a relevant Alfresco Share file used to configure the sub-project with the correct settings, depending on your environment. For more details, see [Share configuration]({% link content-services/6.2/develop/share-ext-points/index.md %}).
`src/test/java/<groupId>...` | This folder contains the same content you can find in a regular Java project, i.e. the Java source code for tests. Here you should put all the custom classes, interfaces, and Java source code related to tests.


## Setting up your development environment

The Maven Alfresco SDK is designed to work well with [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/){:target="_blank"} and [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/){:target="_blank"}.

### Setting up your development environment using Eclipse

The Maven Alfresco SDK is designed to work well with Eclipse. This support includes the ability to import existing Alfresco projects created using the 
Alfresco SDK.

Here we assume you already have an Eclipse installation up and running, together with an available Alfresco project created using the Alfresco SDK. If you 
don't have a project already, follow the steps in [Getting started with Alfresco SDK 4.1](#gettingstarted) to learn how to quickly generate it in a few 
easy steps.

#### Importing the Alfresco project into Eclipse

1. Starting from Eclipse, select `File > Import > Maven > Existing Maven Projects` from the main menu to import the Alfresco project.

    ![sdk-dev-env-eclipse-import]({% link content-services/images/sdk-dev-env-eclipse-import.png %})

2. Click `Next` then browse to the root of the Alfresco project.

    ![sdk-dev-env-eclipse-project]({% link content-services/images/sdk-dev-env-eclipse-project.png %})

3. Click `Finish` to start importing the project into Eclipse.

    Before completing the import, Eclipse checks the completeness of the local Maven repository. If you already have a local repository that includes all the 
    required dependencies, this task will finish relatively quickly. Otherwise, be patient and wait until the downloads are completed (it can take some time).
    
    Once the import is complete, a warning message may be displayed.
    
    ![sdk-dev-env-eclipse-warning]({% link content-services/images/sdk-dev-env-eclipse-warning.png %})

4. Click `Resolve All Later` to complete the import task.

5. Check the Markers tab in the bottom panel, where you may see some Maven problems. Expand the list and right click on a item with an error, then select `Quick Fix` and mark as shown.

    ![sdk-dev-env-eclipse-quickfix]({% link content-services/images/sdk-dev-env-eclipse-quickfix.png %})

6. Click `Finish` to confirm the fix.

    You may be asked to confirm your selection.

7. Repeat the fix for all similar issues you have. Note that these issues really depend on the archetype you used to generate the project.

    Once done, you may see an error with description: Project configuration is not up-to-date with pom.xml.

8. To fix this, right click one of the Alfresco projects and select `Maven > Update Project`, ensure all the Alfresco projects and sub-projects are selected, and then click `OK`.

Once this is done, the project is successfully imported in Eclipse. 

If you want more detail about how to work with the project, please visit [Working with generated projects](#workingwithprojects).

### Setting up your development environment using Intellij IDEA

The Maven Alfresco SDK is designed to work well with Eclipse. This support includes the ability to import existing Alfresco projects created using the 
Alfresco SDK.

Here we assume you already have an Eclipse installation up and running, together with an available Alfresco project created using the Alfresco SDK. If you 
don't have a project already, follow the steps in [Getting started with Alfresco SDK 4.1](#gettingstarted) to learn how to quickly generate it in a few 
easy steps.

#### Importing the Alfresco project into Intellij IDEA

1. Starting from IntelliJ IDEA, select `File > Open` from the main menu to open the Alfresco project. Alternatively, select `Import Project` if you're running IntelliJ IDEA for the first time in your development environment.

    ![sdk-dev-env-intellij-import]({% link content-services/images/sdk-dev-env-intellij-import.png %})

2. After the project is imported, you will see a window similar to the following:

    ![sdk-dev-env-intellij-finish]({% link content-services/images/sdk-dev-env-intellij-finish.png %})

Once this is done, the project is successfully imported in IntelliJ IDEA. 

If you want more detail about how to work with the project, please visit [Working with generated projects](#workingwithprojects).

## Advanced topics

This information provides more advanced topics that you might come in contact with when you have been working with an SDK project for a while. We will have a 
look at how you can work with AMPs, remote debugging, hot reloading, enable transformations and more.

### Switching Content Services and Share versions

The latest version of the Alfresco SDK supports different versions for Content Services and Alfresco Share. Since each product is no longer 
released under one common version number, ACS (i.e. alfresco.war) and the Share UI (share.war) are now released with individual version numbers.

By default, SDK 4 is configured to generate projects using the most recent version of ACS and Share. You can easily change one (or both) versions by 
simply updating the `pom.xml` file in your project. The compatibility of these versions is up to you, however you should check in advance the right versions 
to use.

When editing `pom.xml` you will see a number of properties that define the Content Services platform version and the Alfresco Share version, such as:

```xml
<alfresco.platform.version>6.1.2-ga</alfresco.platform.version>
<alfresco.share.version>6.1.0-RC3</alfresco.share.version>
```

Before continuing, always remember to start from a newly generated SDK project before changing the version numbers. We do not recommend changing the versions 
using developed customizations or source code.

This article is focused on the Community version. If you want to switch to Alfresco Enterprise, please visit [Working with Enterprise](#workingwithenterprise).

The supported versions are explained in the next sections of this article.

#### Switch to Alfresco version 6.0.x

Starting from a newly created Alfresco SDK 4.1 project (All-In-One, Platform JAR, or Share JAR), let’s replace the two properties with the following ones.

1. Open the pom.xml in your generated project.

2. Replace the properties with the following:

    ```xml
    <alfresco.platform.version>6.0.7-ga</alfresco.platform.version>
    <alfresco.share.version>6.0.c</alfresco.share.version>
    ```

    In this example we have shown the switch to version 6.0.7-ga. Feel free to use the correct version for your project, paying attention to the compatible versions 
    of Content Services and Alfresco Share.

3. After changing the versions, delete all the previous data of your development Docker environment:

    ```bash
    $ ./run.sh purge
    ```

4. Rebuild and restart the project:

    ```bash
    $ ./run.sh build_start
    ```

>**IMPORTANT:** Alfresco 6.1+ is ready to work with JDK 11, but Alfresco 6.0 needs to be compiled and run using JDK 8, so please take this into account when you
switch from version 6.1+ to 6.0.x. If you compile Alfresco 6.0.x with JDK 11 you'll experience the issue described in the [Troubleshooting page](#troubleshooting) 
about wrong JDK versions.

#### Switch to Alfresco version 6.1.x

Starting from a newly created Alfresco SDK 4.1 project (All-In-One, Platform JAR, or Share JAR), let’s replace the two properties with the following ones.

1. Open the pom.xml in your generated project.

2. Replace the properties with the following:

    ```xml
    <alfresco.platform.version>6.1.2-ga</alfresco.platform.version>
    <alfresco.share.version>6.1.0-RC3</alfresco.share.version>
    ```
    
    In this example we have shown the switch to version 6.1.2-ga. Feel free to use the correct version for your project, paying attention to the compatible versions 
    of Content Services and Alfresco Share.

3. After changing the versions, delete all the previous data of your development Docker environment:

    ```bash
    $ ./run.sh purge
    ```

4. Rebuild and restart the project:

    ```bash
    $ ./run.sh build_start
    ```

### Working with Enterprise {#workingwithenterprise}

By default the Alfresco SDK will use Community Edition releases but it can be configured to use Enterprise Edition releases. Here you will learn how to 
set up a project to work with an Enterprise Edition release, highlighting the changes required to make it work.

If you would like to work with the Alfresco Enterprise Edition, then this requires just a few property changes and a license installation. You also need 
to have access to the private Alfresco Nexus repository and the private Alfresco Quay.io Docker registry. See:

* [How to configure private Alfresco Nexus repository](#enterprisemvnrepo).
* [How to configure private Alfresco Docker registry](#enterprisedockerregistry).

#### Installing the license

The very first task to complete is about installing an enterprise license, otherwise the server will remain in read-only mode. This task is required if and 
only if you used the All-In-One archetype or the Platform JAR archetype to generate your project. If you used the Share JAR archetype to generate your project, 
feel free to ignore this task and move on the next one.

If you are an Alfresco Partner or Customer, you can request an enterprise license by you opening a ticket on the [Alfresco Support Portal](https://support.alfresco.com/){:target="_blank"}. 
The Enterprise license is nothing more and nothing less than a file with `lic` extension. The Enterprise license file goes into `src/main/docker/license` 
folder (this folder will be located under the platform JAR submodule if you're using the All-In-One archetype). The license will be copied into the ACS Docker 
container before it is started. The license file name doesn't matter, but make sure that you keep it simple and maintain the `lic` extension.

#### Configuring the Enterprise release

The configuration of the Enterprise version is straightforward when using the `pom.xml` configuration file stored in the root folder of your project. 
You'll need to update the following settings in the `pom.xml` file:

* Change the _bill of materials_ (BOM) dependency name:

```xml
<alfresco.bomDependencyArtifactId>acs-packaging</alfresco.bomDependencyArtifactId>
```

* Change the Docker ACS image name:

```xml
<docker.acs.image>alfresco/alfresco-content-repository</docker.acs.image>
```

Changing these parameters instructs the project to use the proper maven dependencies and Docker images.

Depending on the needs of your project, it will probably be necessary to change the `org.alfresco:alfresco-remote-api` dependency to 
`org.alfresco:alfresco-enterprise-remote-api` or adding any other enterprise dependency like `org.alfresco:alfresco-enterprise-repository`. In any case, 
it won't be necessary to include the version of any of these dependencies due to the addition of the BOM dependency in the `dependencyManagement` 
section of the parent `pom.xml` file. 

#### Configuring the Enterprise version

The configuration of the Enterprise version is straightforward when using the `pom.xml` configuration file stored in the root folder of your project. 
You'll need to update the following settings in the `pom.xml` file:

```xml
<alfresco.platform.version>6.2.0</alfresco.platform.version>
<alfresco.share.version>6.2.0</alfresco.share.version>
```

Making use of the Alfresco SDK 4 it is no longer required the configuration of the Alfresco Surf versions. The inclusion of the BOM and the custom Docker
images will take care of that task automatically for you.

#### Purging the project data and running the project

Once all the previous configuration is done, you only need to purge any possible old data (persistent data from the Docker containers), rebuild and restart
the project.

```bash
$ ./run.sh purge
$ ./run.sh build_start
```  

If you're using Windows, you'll need to use the `run.bat` script instead of `run.sh`.

#### How to configure private Alfresco Nexus repository {#enterprisemvnrepo}.

The first matter to consider is to ensure that you have credentials for the Alfresco Private Repository 
([artifacts.alfresco.com](https://artifacts.alfresco.com/nexus/#welcome){:target="_blank"}), where the Alfresco artifacts are stored. Enterprise customers and partners can 
request these credentials opening a ticket on the [Alfresco Support Portal](https://support.alfresco.com/){:target="_blank"}. 

Once you have suitable credentials, you need to add support for Alfresco private Maven repository to your configuration. This would typically be done by 
adding your access credentials to the `settings.xml` contained in your `~/.m2` directory (for Linux and OS X). On Windows this resolves to 
`C:\Users\<username>\.m2`.

To do this, load `settings.xml` into your editor and add the following new server configuration in the `<servers>` section:

```xml
<server>
    <id>alfresco-private-repository</id>
    <username>username</username>
    <password>password</password>
</server>
```

You will need to replace the placeholder text with your real username and password as allocated by Alfresco. The id value should not be changed as it 
is used in the Alfresco SDK project build files to specify the Enterprise artifacts Maven repository.

It is possible to use encrypted passwords here. See the [official Maven documentation](http://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-encryption.html){:target="_blank"} for details 
on how to do this.

At this point you have configured Maven to have access to the Alfresco Private Repository.
                                                         
#### How to configure private Alfresco Docker registry {#enterprisedockerregistry}

In order to download the Docker images needed to work with Content Services Enterprise Edition it is required to configure the Alfresco private Docker registry 
hosted at [Quay.io](https://quay.io/){:target="_blank"}. 

The first matter to consider is to ensure that you have credentials for the Alfresco private Docker registry, where the Alfresco images are stored. Customers and partners can 
request these credentials opening a ticket on the [Alfresco Support Portal](https://support.alfresco.com/){:target="_blank"}. 

Once you have suitable credentials, you only need to login your docker installation to the Quay.io Docker registry:

```bash
$ docker login quay.io
```

At this point you have configured Docker to have access to the Alfresco private Docker registry at [Quay.io](https://quay.io/){:target="_blank"}.

#### How to set up Alfresco Transform Service {#setuptransformservice}

By default, the _Alfresco Transform Service_ (from now ATS) is not included in the basic configuration of the projects generated making use of the Alfresco 
SDK archetypes. 

ATS is only supported in ACS Enterprise and it is distributed as a composition of Docker containers. The docker images required for ATS are available in the 
Alfresco private docker registry at [Quay.io](https://quay.io/){:target="_blank"}. For more information, 
see [How to configure private Alfresco Docker registry](#enterprisedockerregistry).

In order to properly configure ATS in a project generated using the Alfresco SDK archetypes it is required to execute 2 steps:

1. Add the containers that conform ATS to the Docker compose file.
2. Configure the properties that are required to properly set up ATS.

##### Adding the new containers

* Locate the Docker compose file (usually at `PROJECT_ROOT_PATH/docker/docker-compose.yml`) and add the containers that conform ATS (`transform-router`, 
`alfresco-pdf-renderer`, `imagemagick`, `libreoffice`, `tika`, `transform-misc`, `shared-file-store` and `activemq`):

      - 61616:61616 # OpenWire
      - 61613:61613 # STOMP
...
```

* Check that you haven't any port conflict with other services in the Docker compose file.
* Add the new volume required for the shared file store (`alfresco/alfresco-shared-file-store`) in the Docker compose file:

```text
volumes:
  ...
  shared-file-store-volume:
    driver_opts:
      type: tmpfs
      device: tmpfs
```

##### Adding the required configuration

* Locate the _Alfresco global properties_ file for docker (usually at `PROJECT_ROOT_PATH/PROJECT_ARTIFACT_ID-platform-docker/src/main/docker/alfresco-global.properties`) 
and add the ATS configuration properties:

```text
# Alfresco Transform Service
transform.service.enabled=true
transform.service.url=http://transform-router:8095
sfs.url=http://shared-file-store:8099/

local.transform.service.enabled=true
localTransform.pdfrenderer.url=http://alfresco-pdf-renderer:8090/
localTransform.imagemagick.url=http://imagemagick:8090/
localTransform.libreoffice.url=http://libreoffice:8090/
localTransform.tika.url=http://tika:8090/
localTransform.misc.url=http://transform-misc:8090/

legacy.transform.service.enabled=true
alfresco-pdf-renderer.url=http://alfresco-pdf-renderer:8090/
jodconverter.url=http://libreoffice:8090/
img.url=http://imagemagick:8090/
tika.url=http://tika:8090/
transform.misc.url=http://transform-misc:8090/

messaging.broker.url=failover:(nio://activemq:61616)?timeout=3000&jms.useCompression=true
```

* Remove the old value of the property `messaging.broker.url` in the same `alfresco-global.properties` file.

Once these 2 modifications are done, rebuild and restart all the services (`run.sh/run.bat build_start`) and ACS will use ATS to execute remote transformations 
asynchronously whenever possible.

### Working with AMPs {#workingwithamps}

Since the early days of the Alfresco SDK, the Alfresco Module Packages (AMP) have been the way customizations were packaged. In Alfresco SDK 4.1 everything 
is packaged as a JAR by default, while the AMPs are still available as an optional assembly. This gives you much more control over packaging, and simple 
modules can easily be deployed as JARs.

The [Maven Assembly Plugin](http://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-assembly-plugin/){:target="_blank"} allows you to control the final artifacts that Maven builds. You add the 
plugin configuration and point it to an XML file that contains the full configuration on the artifact we want to produce.

#### Building AMPs with Alfresco SDK 4

To build AMPs the SDK ships a default assembly XML file that will tell the assembly plugin how to produce an AMP file. You will find this file in 
`src/main/assembly/amp.xml` (in the case of All-In-One project you'll find one descriptor for the platform JAR module and another for the share JAR module). 
The plugin configuration is already present in your `pom.xml` file, as shown:

```xml
<plugin>
    <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
    <artifactId>maven-assembly-plugin</artifactId>
    <version>2.6</version>
    <executions>
        <execution>
            <id>build-amp-file</id>
            <phase>package</phase>
            <goals>
                <goal>single</goal>
            </goals>
            <configuration>
                <appendAssemblyId>false</appendAssemblyId>
                <descriptor>src/main/assembly/amp.xml</descriptor>
            </configuration>
        </execution>
    </executions>
    <dependencies>
        <dependency>
            <groupId>org.alfresco.maven.plugin</groupId>
            <artifactId>alfresco-maven-plugin</artifactId>
            <version>${alfresco.sdk.version}</version>
        </dependency>
    </dependencies>
</plugin>
```

This section is commented out by default.

1. To produce both a JAR file and an AMP, remove the comments and run the `mvn package` command. 

Now you have full control over how your AMPs are built. If you want to change the content of the AMP, you can change the assembly `amp.xml` and tailor it 
to your needs.

#### Installing AMPs with the SDK

The projects created from the Alfresco SDK 4.1 archetypes are configured to deploy either JARs or AMPs to the ACS / Share docker container. The only thing to
do is modify the `pom.xml` file of the corresponding docker module / project in order to properly configure the dependencies and the Maven dependency plugin.

##### All-In-One project

1. Modify the platform JAR dependency from the file `PROJECT_ARTIFACT_ID-platform-docker/pom.xml` to set the type of dependency to `amp`:

    ```xml
    <dependencies>
        <dependency>
            <groupId>org.alfresco</groupId>
            <artifactId>sample-module-platform</artifactId>
            <version>1.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
            <type>amp</type>
        </dependency>
    </dependencies>
    ```

2. Add the `<includeTypes>amp</includeTypes>` to the `collect-extensions` execution in maven-dependency-plugin plugin build configuration in the same file:

    ```xml
    <!-- Collect extensions (JARs or AMPs) declared in this module do be deployed to docker -->
    <execution>
        <id>collect-extensions</id>
        <phase>package</phase>
        <goals>
            <goal>copy-dependencies</goal>
        </goals>
        <configuration>
            <outputDirectory>${project.build.directory}/extensions</outputDirectory>
            <includeScope>runtime</includeScope>
            <includeTypes>amp</includeTypes>
        </configuration>
    </execution>
    ```

3. Repeat these steps for the share module in the file `PROJECT_ARTIFACT_ID-share-docker/pom.xml`.

##### Platform / Share project

1. Modify the Maven Resource Plugin in the file `pom.xml` to set the platform / share JAR artifact to copy to `amp`:

    ```xml
    <execution>
        <id>copy-repository-extension</id>
        <phase>package</phase>
        <goals>
            <goal>copy-resources</goal>
        </goals>
        <configuration>
            <outputDirectory>${project.build.directory}/extensions</outputDirectory>
            <resources>
                <resource>
                    <directory>target</directory>
                    <includes>
                        <include>${project.build.finalName}.amp</include>
                    </includes>
                    <filtering>false</filtering>
                </resource>
            </resources>
        </configuration>
    </execution>
    ```
    
Once this configuration is in place, you simply need to rebuild and restart the project. The new configuration will make the Docker images automatically 
install the packaged AMPs in ACS / Share.

#### Installing 3rd party AMPs {#installing3rdpartyamps}

Installing 3rd party AMPs to the projects is pretty simple. The only requirement is adding the dependency to the project. The default configuration installs
any AMPs set as a maven dependency in the corresponding Docker image. It is important to remember that ACS and Share are separated containers, so you'll need
to add the dependency in the corresponding docker module in case of an All-In-One project. 

Here is an example of how to install Florian Maul's Javascript Console.

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<project xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0"
         xsi:schemaLocation="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0 http://maven.apache.org/maven-v4_0_0.xsd">
    <modelVersion>4.0.0</modelVersion>
    <artifactId>sample-module-platform-docker</artifactId>
    <name>Alfresco Platform/Repository Docker Module</name>
    <description>Platform/Repo Docker Module to generate the final Docker image</description>
    <packaging>jar</packaging>

    <parent>
        <groupId>org.alfresco</groupId>
        <artifactId>sample-module</artifactId>
        <version>1.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
    </parent>

    <properties>
    </properties>

    <dependencies>
        <dependency>
            <groupId>org.alfresco</groupId>
            <artifactId>sample-module-platform</artifactId>
            <version>1.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
        </dependency>

        <!-- Javascript Console AMP -->
        <dependency>
            <groupId>de.fmaul</groupId>
            <artifactId>javascript-console-repo</artifactId>
            <version>0.6</version>
            <type>amp</type>
        </dependency>
    </dependencies>
    
    ...
</project>
```

Another option for installing 3rd party AMPs to the projects is to have the amps local to the project. In this approach 
the amp file, the amp local to the project will be copied and applied from the Docker file. To use local amp you need to:

1. Modify the `<project>-platform-docker/pom.xml`
2. Create directory: `<project>-platform-docker/src/main/docker/extensions`
3. Copy the amp file into `<project>-platform-docker/src/main/docker/extensions`

The project `Dockerfile` contains directives to apply amp to Alfresco image in the build element of `./workshop-sdk4-platform-docker/pom.xml`,
exclude *.amp in the `copy-and-filter-docker-resources` execution step:

```xml
<artifactId>maven-resources-plugin</artifactId>
<executions>
    <execution>
        <id>copy-and-filter-docker-resources</id>
        <phase>validate</phase>
        <goals>
            <goal>copy-resources</goal>
        </goals>
        <configuration>
            <outputDirectory>${project.build.directory}</outputDirectory>
            <resources>
                <resource>
                    <directory>src/main/docker</directory>
                    <filtering>true</filtering>
                    <excludes>
                        <exclude>**/*.jar</exclude>
                        <exclude>**/*.so</exclude>
                        <exclude>**/*.gz</exclude>
                        <exclude>**/*.amp</exclude>            
                    </excludes>
                </resource>
            </resources>
        </configuration>
    </execution>
```

include *.amp in the `copy-and-filter-docker-resources-non-filtered`:

```xml
<execution>
    <id>copy-and-filter-docker-resources-non-filtered</id>
    <phase>validate</phase>
    <goals>
        <goal>copy-resources</goal>
    </goals>
    <configuration>
        <outputDirectory>${project.build.directory}</outputDirectory>
        <resources>
            <resource>
                <directory>src/main/docker</directory>
                <filtering>false</filtering>
                <includes>
                    <include>**/*.jar</include>
                    <include>**/*.so</include>
                    <include>**/*.gz</include>
                    <include>**/*.amp</include>
                </includes>
            </resource>
        </resources>
    </configuration>
</execution>
```

## Controlling the order AMPs are applied

Under some specific circumstances it is necessary to apply different AMPs in a development project in a precise order. The default configuration of the 
projects generated using the Alfresco SDK 4.1 archetypes doesn't specify any concrete order applying the AMPs to the ACS/Share installation.

Anyway, that order can be controlled modifying slightly the configuration of the custom Docker images in the project. For instance, let's say we have three
third party AMPs that we want to apply in the next order `third-party-amp-01.amp -> third-party-amp-02.amp -> third-party-amp-03.amp`. In this example, we're
going to consider we need to apply them to a platform JAR module (the process would be the same for a Share module, simply changing the path of the files).

1. Follow the steps described in the section [Installing 3rd party AMPs](#installing3rdpartyamps) to include all the AMPs dependencies.
2. Locate the `Dockerfile` under the folder `src/main/docker`. In this file, there is a section that copies and applies the AMPs to the ACS installation.

    ```bash
    # Copy Dockerfile to avoid an error if no AMPs exist
    COPY Dockerfile extensions/*.amp $TOMCAT_DIR/amps/
    RUN java -jar $TOMCAT_DIR/alfresco-mmt/alfresco-mmt*.jar install \
                  $TOMCAT_DIR/amps $TOMCAT_DIR/webapps/alfresco -directory -nobackup -force
    ```

3. Replace the `RUN` command to execute one installation of AMP each time and copy it three times, ensuring the installation is executed in the required order:

    ```bash
    # Copy Dockerfile to avoid an error if no AMPs exist
    COPY Dockerfile extensions/*.amp $TOMCAT_DIR/amps/
    # Install third-party-amp-01
    RUN java -jar $TOMCAT_DIR/alfresco-mmt/alfresco-mmt*.jar install \
                  $TOMCAT_DIR/amps/third-party-amp-01.amp $TOMCAT_DIR/webapps/alfresco -directory -nobackup -force
    # Install third-party-amp-02
    RUN java -jar $TOMCAT_DIR/alfresco-mmt/alfresco-mmt*.jar install \
                  $TOMCAT_DIR/amps/third-party-amp-02.amp $TOMCAT_DIR/webapps/alfresco -directory -nobackup -force
    # Install third-party-amp-03
    RUN java -jar $TOMCAT_DIR/alfresco-mmt/alfresco-mmt*.jar install \
                  $TOMCAT_DIR/amps/third-party-amp-03.amp $TOMCAT_DIR/webapps/alfresco -directory -nobackup -force
    ```

4. Rebuild and restart the project (use `run.bat` instead in Windows):

    ```bash
    $ ./run.sh build_start
    ```

At this point, you have configured your project to apply the AMPs in a specific order.

### Debugging

When developing add-ins, fixing bugs, or changing Alfresco from the source code, it is helpful to debug an instance of Alfresco running on a standard 
application server. This section outlines the steps needed to configure Alfresco and Eclipse (or IntelliJ IDEA) to provide a real-time view of the server 
and to troubleshoot issues by stepping through the code line by line.

Here we assume you have already generated an Alfresco project using the Alfresco SDK. If you don't have a project already, follow the steps in 
[Getting started with Alfresco SDK 4.1](#gettingstarted) to learn how to generate it in a few easy steps.

#### Remote debugging using Eclipse

All the projects generated using the Alfresco SDK 4.1 are pre-configured to listen for remote debug connections. Depending on the selected archetypes you'll 
have a port for remotely debugging ACS, share or both of them.

By default, the remote debug port for ACS is **8888** and for share is **9898**. This configuration can be changed through the maven properties `acs.debug.port` 
and `share.debug.port` in the `pom.xml` file of the main project.

```xml
<!-- Environment configuration properties -->
<share.port>8180</share.port>
<share.debug.port>9898</share.debug.port>
<acs.host>${artifactId}-acs</acs.host>
<acs.port>8080</acs.port>
<acs.debug.port>8888</acs.debug.port>
```

These remote debug ports are configured in the docker compose file to be exposed by the corresponding docker containers.

```text
services:
  sample-project-share:
...
    environment:
      CATALINA_OPTS: "-agentlib:jdwp=transport=dt_socket,server=y,suspend=n,address=0.0.0.0:8888"
      REPO_HOST: sample-project-acs
      REPO_PORT: 8080
    ports:
      - "${share.port}:8080"
      - "${share.debug.port}:8888"
  sample-project-acs:
...
    environment:
      CATALINA_OPTS: "-agentlib:jdwp=transport=dt_socket,server=y,suspend=n,address=0.0.0.0:8888"
    ports:
      - "${acs.port}:8080"
      - "${acs.debug.port}:8888"
...
```

##### Configuring remote debugging using Eclipse

Here you'll see how to create and manage a configuration to remotely debug your launched Alfresco project that's waiting for a connection. This assumes you 
have an Eclipse IDE up and running, and have already imported the same project you are going to debug.

For more details on how to import an Alfresco project into your Eclipse IDE, see Setting up your development environment using Eclipse.

1. Open the Eclipse IDE and click on `Run Configurations` (top right).

    ![sdk-debug-eclipse-create]({% link content-services/images/sdk-debug-eclipse-create.png %})

2. Click on the green plus sign (top left) and select `Remote Java Application` to add a new configuration for a remote app.

3. Enter a descriptive name for your configuration, for example, `Sample project ACS debug`.

    ![sdk-debug-eclipse-config]({% link content-services/images/sdk-debug-eclipse-config.png %})

4. Click Browse then locate the platform project JAR if you want to debug ACS or the share project JAR if you want to debug share.

5. Check that your settings match the screenshot. This is a sample to debug ACS. If you want to debug share or you have configured custom ports for remote debugging you'll need to modify that configuration. If you're working with _Docker Toolbox_ instead of _Docker Desktop_ the host to access the container won't be `localhost` but a configured _IP_ address (i.e. 192.168.99.100).

6. Click `Apply`.

    You will be taken back to the project source code.

7. Click on the bug icon and select the new configuration to run it.

    ![sdk-debug-eclipse-launch]({% link content-services/images/sdk-debug-eclipse-launch.png %})

    The IDE connects the source code to the deployed one at the docker container. Once the code is linked, you can open a browser and start using your 
    application. In our case, we are going to test the behavior of debugging by running the sample webscript.

8. Open your browser and type `http://localhost:8080/alfresco/s/sample/helloworld`.

    This is a sample webscript generated in every project created using SDK 4.1 and the platform artifact.
    
    ![sdk-hellofromjava]({% link content-services/images/sdk-hellofromjava.png %})

    Now let's find the `HelloWorldWebScript.java` file in the `src/main/java/.../platformsample` folder of your project. If you're using an All-In-One project, 
    the folder is located in the platform sub-project.

9. Edit the file using Eclipse IDE and set a breakpoint (by clicking to the left of the line number) at line:

    ```java
    model.put(“fromJava”,”HelloFromJava”);
    ```

10. Refresh the browser. Eclipse will intercept the execution at the breakpoint:

    ![sdk-debug-eclipse-breakpoint]({% link content-services/images/sdk-debug-eclipse-breakpoint.png %})

From here the management is the same as for a regular Java application using your preferred IDE. Please note that the whole Alfresco source code is available 
at debug time, thanks to the local maven repository.

#### Remote debugging using IntelliJ

All the projects generated using the Alfresco SDK 4.1 are pre-configured to listen for remote debug connections. Depending on the selected archetypes you'll 
have a port for remotely debugging ACS, share or both of them.

By default, the remote debug port for ACS is **8888** and for share is **9898**. This configuration can be changed through the maven properties `acs.debug.port` 
and `share.debug.port` in the `pom.xml` file of the main project.

```xml
<!-- Environment configuration properties -->
<share.port>8180</share.port>
<share.debug.port>9898</share.debug.port>
<acs.host>${artifactId}-acs</acs.host>
<acs.port>8080</acs.port>
<acs.debug.port>8888</acs.debug.port>
```

These remote debug ports are configured in the docker compose file to be exposed by the corresponding docker containers.

```text
services:
  sample-project-share:
...
    environment:
      CATALINA_OPTS: "-agentlib:jdwp=transport=dt_socket,server=y,suspend=n,address=0.0.0.0:8888"
      REPO_HOST: sample-project-acs
      REPO_PORT: 8080
    ports:
      - "${share.port}:8080"
      - "${share.debug.port}:8888"
  sample-project-acs:
...
    environment:
      CATALINA_OPTS: "-agentlib:jdwp=transport=dt_socket,server=y,suspend=n,address=0.0.0.0:8888"
    ports:
      - "${acs.port}:8080"
      - "${acs.debug.port}:8888"
...
```

##### Configuring remote debugging using IntelliJ

Here you'll see how to create and manage a configuration to remotely debug your launched Alfresco project that's waiting for a connection. This assumes you 
have an IntelliJ IDEA IDE up and running, and have already imported the same project you are going to debug.

For more details on how to import an Alfresco project into your IntelliJ IDEA IDE, see Setting up your development environment using Intellij IDEA.

1. Open the IntelliJ IDEA IDE and click on `Add/Edit Configurations` (top right).

    ![sdk-debug-intellij-create]({% link content-services/images/sdk-debug-intellij-create.png %})

2. Click on the plus icon (top left) and select `Remote` to add a new configuration for a remote app.

3. Enter a descriptive name for your configuration, for example, `Sample project ACS debug`.

    ![sdk-debug-intellij-config]({% link content-services/images/sdk-debug-intellij-config.png %})

4. Check that your settings match the screenshot. This is a sample to debug ACS. If you want to debug share or you have configured custom ports for remote debugging you'll need to modify that configuration. If you're working with _Docker Toolbox_ instead of _Docker Desktop_ the host to access the container won't be `localhost` but a configured _IP_ address (i.e. 192.168.99.100).

5. Click `OK`.

    You will be taken back to the project source code.

6. Click on the `Edit Configurations` dropdown box and select the new configuration to run it.

    ![sdk-debug-intellij-launch]({% link content-services/images/sdk-debug-intellij-launch.png %})

    The IDE connects the source code with the deployed one at the docker container. Once the code is linked, you can open a browser and start using your 
    application. In our case, we are going to test the behavior of debugging by running the sample webscript.

7. Open your browser and type `http://localhost:8080/alfresco/s/sample/helloworld`.

    This is a sample webscript generated in every project created using SDK 4.1 and the platform artifact.
    
    ![sdk-hellofromjava]({% link content-services/images/sdk-hellofromjava.png %})
    
    Now let's find the `HelloWorldWebScript.java` file in the `src/main/java/.../platformsample` folder of your project. If you're using an All-In-One project, 
    the folder is located in the platform sub-project.

8. Edit the file using IntelliJ IDEA IDE and set a breakpoint (by clicking to the left of the line number) at line:

    ```java
    model.put(“fromJava”,”HelloFromJava”);
    ```

9. Refresh the browser. IntelliJ IDEA will intercept the execution at the breakpoint:

    ![sdk-debug-intellij-breakpoint]({% link content-services/images/sdk-debug-intellij-breakpoint.png %})

From here the management is the same as for a regular Java application using your preferred IDE. Please note that the whole Alfresco source code is available 
at debug time, thanks to the local maven repository.

### Integration testing

_"Integration testing is the phase in software testing where individual software modules are combined and tested as a group. It occurs after unit testing and 
before validation testing. Integration testing takes as its input modules that have been unit tested, groups them in larger aggregates, applies tests defined 
in an integration test plan to those aggregates, and delivers as its output the integrated system ready for system testing. [Wikipedia]."_

Even if the definition of integration testing is a general description, the concept is also valid for Alfresco projects. 

The Alfresco SDK 4.1 keeps the same general idea of integration testing provided by SDK 3.0, but this new version reshapes it slightly to leverage on a 
Docker-oriented environment.

Here are the basics to understanding and using integration testing in the context of projects created with the SDK, from a technical perspective:

* SDK 4.1 develops integration tests for the platform only. Currently, the integration tests that the SDK is able to manage by default is related to Content Services (ACS) only.
* Integration tests require an ACS instance to be up and running. You will see that all the scripts and commands are designed to easily manage this requirement, but the prerequisite for the SDK is that an ACS instance is available.
* If you're running a project created with a Platform JAR archetype, integration tests are not provided by default. However, you can copy them from your All-In-One project.

#### How SDK's integration tests work

The Alfresco SDK's integration tests are primarily supported by a utility module included in the SDK called 
[Alfresco Rapid Application Development](https://github.com/Alfresco/alfresco-sdk/tree/master/modules/alfresco-rad){:target="_blank"} 
(alfresco-rad). This module basically enables the execution of the integration tests within the context of a running Alfresco Content Service (ACS) instance.

##### Alfresco Rapid Application Development (Alfresco RAD)

The Alfresco RAD is an Alfresco module which main functionality is offering the ability to execute integration tests in a real ACS context. The core classes
that conforms the Alfresco RAD module are:

* [AlfrescoTestRunner](https://github.com/Alfresco/alfresco-sdk/blob/master/modules/alfresco-rad/src/main/java/org/alfresco/rad/test/AlfrescoTestRunner.java){:target="_blank"}. A JUnit test runner that is designed to work with an ACS instance. It detects if it's executing a test inside of a running ACS instance. If that is the case the tests are all run normally. If the test is being run from outside the repository, then, instead of running the actual test, an HTTP request is made to a Web Script (`RunTestWebScript`) in a running Alfresco instance.
* [RunTestWebScript](https://github.com/Alfresco/alfresco-sdk/blob/master/modules/alfresco-rad/src/main/java/org/alfresco/rad/test/RunTestWebScript.java){:target="_blank"}. This Web Script works in consort with the `AlfrescoTestRunner`. When a test is run from outside the repository, the Alfresco test runner sends a proxied request to perform the test to this script. This runs the test and wraps the results up so that the test initiator can be fooled into thinking they are running the tests locally.
* [AbstractAlfrescoIT](https://github.com/Alfresco/alfresco-sdk/blob/master/modules/alfresco-rad/src/main/java/org/alfresco/rad/test/AbstractAlfrescoIT.java){:target="_blank"}. Abstract integration test class that gives access to the Alfresco Spring Application context and the `ServiceRegistry` that should be used when accessing Alfresco Services.
* [Remote](https://github.com/Alfresco/alfresco-sdk/blob/master/modules/alfresco-rad/src/main/java/org/alfresco/rad/test/Remote.java){:target="_blank"}. The `AlfrescoTestRunner` class has to determine where the ACS instance endpoint is exposed to send the proxied request to the `RunTestWebScript`. It uses, in order, the next three mechanisms:
    * The `Remote` annotation. If the test is annotated with `@Remote`, then it uses the `endpoint` property to determine the ACS endpoint.
    * The `acs.endpoint.path` Java system property. If the Java system property is set, then its value is used as the ACS endpoint.
    * A default value. If none of the previous mechanisms returned a value, then the default value `http://localhost:8080/alfresco` is used.
    
In summary, if you want to execute your integration tests inside an existing ACS instance, you'll need to annotate them with the JUnit `RunWith` annotation 
and set the value to `AlfrescoTestRunner.class`. If you want to customize the default ACS endpoint location, you can either annotate your tests with `Remote` 
or set the Java system property `acs.endpoint.path`.

##### Integration tests configuration in the All-In-One project

So, taking into account the previous section, let's see how the integration tests are configured in a project generated from the SDK 4.1 All-In-One archetype.

* The maven dependencies required to execute the integration tests are deployed to the ACS Docker image in the `PROJECT_ARTEFACTID-platform-docker` maven module using the `maven-dependency-plugin`. The configuration is done in the file `PROJECT_ARTEFACTID-platform-docker/pom.xml`: 

    ```xml
    <plugin>
        <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
        <artifactId>maven-dependency-plugin</artifactId>
        <executions>

                </configuration>
            </execution>
            ...
        </executions>
    </plugin>
    ```  

* The `integration-tests` maven module include the definition of all the integration test classes to be executed against the existing ACS instance. The test classes are included in the folder `integration-tests/src/test/java`.
* The `integration-tests` maven `pom.xml` file adds the configuration of the `acs.endpoint.path` in case it is required. This is done using the `maven-failsafe-plugin`:

    ```xml
    <plugin>
        <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
        <artifactId>maven-failsafe-plugin</artifactId>
        <configuration>
            <systemPropertyVariables>
                <acs.endpoint.path>${test.acs.endpoint.path}</acs.endpoint.path>
            </systemPropertyVariables>
        </configuration>
    </plugin>
    ```
    
    This is specially useful when the ACS endpoint is not exposed at the default location (`http://localhost:8080/alfresco`). This property is important when the
    development environment is run using Docker Toolbox (old Windows and MacOS versions). In this case, the container exposed ports are not mapped to `localhost`, 
    but to a custom IP provided by the Virtual Box virtual machine (i.e. `http://192.168.99.100:8080/alfresco`).

* The All-In-One project utility scripts (`run.sh` / `run.bat`) offer two different tasks to execute the integration tests:
    * `build_test`. It builds the whole project, recreates the ACS and Share docker images, starts the dockerised environment, executes the integration tests from the `integration-tests` module and stops the environment.
    * `test`. It simply executes the integration tests (the environment must be already started).   

##### Sample tests included in the generated project

The All-In-One archetype includes some basic integration tests that demonstrate the way you can implement the integration tests of your custom module.

###### `CustomContentModelIT`: Checking the correct existence and setup of a custom model

This integration test verifies the existence of the `{http://www.acme.org/model/content/1.0}contentModel` in the Content Services instance. It also 
creates a new node in the repository with the following features:

* The node is named `AcmeFile.txt`.
* The node type is set to `{http://www.acme.org/model/content/1.0}document`.
* The node property `securityClassification` is set to `Company Confidential`.
* The aspect `cm:titled` is added to the new node.

Once created, some Java assertions are raised to check the correct definition of the node. As a last task, the node is deleted from the repository to clean 
the environment.

###### `DemoComponentIT`: Checking the Content Services DemoComponent component

This integration test verifies the existence of the `DemoComponent` component deployed in the Content Services instance. You can find the definition 
of the `DemoComponent` as a custom component of a project created with the All-In-One archetype. For more details, see the class definition in
`PROJECT_ARTEFACTID-platform/src/main/java/com/example/platformsample/DemoComponent.java`.

The integration test retrieves the `DemoComponent` bean from the Content Services instance (see `testGetCompanyHome()`), and requests the Company 
Home component. In addition, some Java assertions check if Company Home is identified correctly and has seven children stored in it.

###### `HelloWorldWebScriptIT`: Checking the Content Services helloworld webscript

This integration test is the simplest one, and verifies the existence and the response of the `helloworld` web script in the Content Services instance. 
The test invokes the web script at the URL `http://localhost:8080/alfresco/service/sample/helloworld` and checks the response using some Java assertions.

#### How to run SDK's integration tests

Running the integration tests of a project generated from the Alfresco SDK 4.1 archetypes is pretty easy. Let's distinguish different cases of executing the
integration tests. 

##### Command line

If you want to run the integration tests from the command line you'll have to use the utility scripts provided by all the projects generated from the 
archetypes. These are `run.sh` if you're on Unix systems or `run.bat` if you're on Windows systems.

If you want to spin up a new dockerised environment with ACS, run the integration tests and stop that environment, you'll use the `build_test` goal:

```bash
$ ./run.sh build_test
```

If you want all your previous data in the docker environment to be wiped out before the execution of the integration tests, remember to call the `purge` goal
before the `build_test` goal:

```bash
$ ./run.sh purge
$ ./run.sh build_test
```

The `build_test` goal will execute the next list of tasks: 

* Stop any previous execution of the dockerised environment.
* Compile all the source code.
* Rebuild the custom Docker images of the project.
* Start a new dockerised environment.
* Execute the integration tests.
* Show the logs of the docker containers during the tests execution.
* Stop the dockerised environment.

If your dockerised environment is already started and you simply want to execute the integration tests against that existing ACS instance, then use the `test`
goal:

```bash
$ ./run.sh test
```

##### Configuring a custom ACS endpoint location

If you want to run your integration tests against an ACS instance not exposed in `http://localhost:8080/alfresco` you'll need to modify a maven property 
before executing the tests. 

The maven property for the test ACS instance endpoint location is `acs.endpoint.path` and you can configure it in the `pom.xml` file in the root folder of your 
project:

```xml
<properties>
    ...
    <test.acs.endpoint.path>http://192.168.99.100:8080/alfresco</test.acs.endpoint.path>
    ...
</properties>
```

This parameter is **specially important** if you're running your dockerised environment using [Docker Toolbox](https://docs.docker.com/toolbox/){:target="_blank"} instead of 
[Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop){:target="_blank"}. If that is the case, then the Docker container exposed ports are not mapped in the hosted
machine as `localhost` but as an assigned IP address (i.e. `192.168.99.100`). 

##### Eclipse IDE

If your project is available in Eclipse, you can easily run one or more of the integration tests directly from your IDE.

To run the integration tests:

1. In order to properly execute the integration tests the dockerised environment must be already up and running with IT support. So, before executing the tests you must run the `build_start_it_supported` or the `start` goal of the `run` script.
2. Open the project using the IDE.
3. Select the classes for the integration tests (either one, some, or the whole package).
4. Right click and select `Run As ...`, then click `JUnit Test`.

![sdk-it-eclipse-run]({% link content-services/images/sdk-it-eclipse-run.png %})

Once the tests have completed (typically, after a few seconds), the results are presented.

![sdk-it-eclipse-results]({% link content-services/images/sdk-it-eclipse-results.png %})

When using an IDE, the source code related to the integration tests is the one deployed directly on the platform side. This means that an update in the code 
for the Java classes will be included when you run the integration tests _if and only if_ they are deployed in the platform. To avoid stopping/starting 
Content Services with every change, use **hot reloading** as the only way to deploy the new version of the Java classes. For more details, see 
[JRebel](#hotreloadingjrebel) / [HotSwapAgent](#hotreloadinghotswapagent) Hot reloading.

##### IntelliJ IDEA IDE

If your project is available in IntelliJ IDEA, you can easily run one or more of the integration tests directly from your IDE.

To run the integration tests:

1. In order to properly execute the integration tests the dockerised environment must be already up and running with IT support. So, before executing the tests you must run the `build_start_it_supported` or the `start` goal of the `run` script.
2. Open the project using the IDE.
3. Select the classes for the integration tests (either one, some, or the whole package).
4. Right click and select `Run Tests`.

![sdk-it-intellij-run]({% link content-services/images/sdk-it-intellij-run.png %})

Once the tests have completed (typically, after a few seconds), the results are presented.

![sdk-it-intellij-results]({% link content-services/images/sdk-it-intellij-results.png %})

When using an IDE, the source code related to the integration tests is the one deployed directly on the platform side. This means that an update in the code 
for the Java classes will be included when you run the integration tests _if and only if_ they are deployed in the platform. To avoid stopping/starting 
Content Services with every change, use **hot reloading** as the only way to deploy the new version of the Java classes. For more details, see 
[JRebel](#hotreloadingjrebel) / [HotSwapAgent](#hotreloadinghotswapagent) Hot reloading.

### Hot reloading

Hot reloading in a Java project is the ability to avoid the infamous _change > restart and wait > check_ development lifecycle. This allows you to modify 
your application's code, and view the changes without having to restart Content Services / Alfresco Share. You can potentially gain significant 
savings in development time that would otherwise be wasted rebuilding the Docker images and restarting the Docker containers.

Hot reloading is a well known behavior in several other languages (C# for example), and the most practical and fast lifecycle like Save&Reload should be 
possible. Hot reloading is the key to enabling [Rapid Application Development (RAD)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapid_application_development){:target="_blank"} and 
[Test Driven Development (TDD)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development){:target="_blank"}.

Since the Java 1.4 JVM, the Debugger API allowed debuggers to update class bytecode in place, using the same class identity. This meant that all objects 
could refer to an updated class and execute new code when their methods were called, preventing the need to reload a container whenever class bytecode was 
changed. All modern IDEs support it, including Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, and NetBeans. Since Java 5, this functionality has also been available directly to 
Java applications through the [Instrumentation API](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/technotes/guides/instrumentation/index.html){:target="_blank"}.

In the Alfresco development lifecycle hot reloading is possible as in every other Java project (and with the same limitations). You can manage a project 
created with the Alfresco SDK using hot reloading through two different tools:

* [JRebel](#hotreloadingjrebel)
* [HotSwapAgent](#hotreloadinghotswapagent)

Both have advantages and disadvantages, so it's up to you to make the right choice for your needs. [JRebel](https://zeroturnaround.com/software/jrebel/){:target="_blank"} is a 
commercial product while [HotSwapAgent](http://hotswapagent.org/index.html){:target="_blank"} is open source. Both products can reload classes and web resources. However, 
JRebel is more powerful than HotSwapAgent and can also reload changes to the Spring XML context files, for example.

#### How to configure and use JRebel {#hotreloadingjrebel}

[JRebel](https://zeroturnaround.com/software/jrebel/){:target="_blank"} is the agent that enables you to do hot reloading. This allows you to modify the application code, 
and view the changes without having to restart Alfresco Tomcat (or the ACS Docker container).

A prerequisite to this tutorial is having an Alfresco project created with Alfresco SDK 4.1, using the All-In-One archetype, or the Platform JAR archetype. 
It's worth noting that hot reloading is only supported on the platform, and not in Alfresco Share.

An open source and free of charge alternative to JRebel is HotSwapAgent. For more details, see the [HotSwapAgent website](http://hotswapagent.org/index.html){:target="_blank"}.

JRebel can be installed in several ways: for example, using an IDE or in "standalone" mode. Various IDEs are supported, including Eclipse and IntelliJ. The 
standalone installation is useful if you want to use hot reloading from the command line.

##### Installing JRebel standalone (from the command line)

1. Download JRebel in standalone mode and unpack it in your preferred location.
2. Run the activate-gui.sh script to activate your installation.

_Note that a license is required. In this step you will be able to request a trial license._

##### Installing JRebel using Eclipse IDE

1. Open Eclipse and go to `Help > Eclipse Marketplace`….
2. Search for JRebel and select Install.
3. Restart Eclipse to complete the installation.
4. Select `Help > JRebel > Activation` to activate your installation.

    >**Note** that a license is required. In this step you will be able to request a trial license.

5. Select `Help > JRebel > Configuration > Remote servers` to add a new remote server.
6. Give a descriptive name to the new server and set the `Server URL` as `http://localhost:8080/alfresco`.

    ![sdk-jrebel-eclipse-server]({% link content-services/images/sdk-jrebel-eclipse-server.png %})

7. Select the checkbox to enable the server synchronisation and the checkbox to `Synchronize on build`.

    ![sdk-jrebel-eclipse-servers]({% link content-services/images/sdk-jrebel-eclipse-servers.png %})

8. Select `Help > JRebel > Configuration > Projects` and select the checkbox to enable JRebel and the remote server support for required projects (the complete project in case of the Platform Jar archetype or the `PROJECT_ARTIFACT_ID-platform` and `PROJECT_ARTEFACTID-integration-tests` modules in case of the All-In-One archetype).

    ![sdk-jrebel-eclipse-projects]({% link content-services/images/sdk-jrebel-eclipse-projects.png %})

##### Installing JRebel using IntelliJ IDEA

1. Open IntelliJ and go to `Preferences > Plugins`….
2. Search for JRebel and select Install.
3. Restart IntelliJ to complete the installation.
4. Select `Preferences > JRebel > JRebel License` to activate your installation.
    
    >**Note** that a license is required. In this step you will be able to request a trial license._

5. Select `Preferences > JRebel > Remote Servers` to add a new remote server.
6. Give a descriptive name to the new server and set the `Server URL` as `http://localhost:8080/alfresco.

    ![sdk-jrebel-intellij-server]({% link content-services/images/sdk-jrebel-intellij-server.png %})

7. Select the checkbox to enable the server synchronisation and the checkbox to `Synchronize on build`.

    ![sdk-jrebel-intellij-servers]({% link content-services/images/sdk-jrebel-intellij-servers.png %})

8. Open the JRebel Panel and select the checkbox to enable JRebel and the remote server support for required projects (the complete project in case of the Platform Jar archetype or the `PROJECT_ARTIFACT_ID-platform` and `PROJECT_ARTEFACTID-integration-tests` modules in case of the All-In-One archetype).

##### Configuring JRebel in the project

By default, JRebel is not set up in the projects generated making use of the Alfresco SDK archetypes. So, in order to enable it, you'll need to follow the next 
steps:

1. Once JRebel is activated, copy `JREBEL_BASE_DIR/jrebel.jar` and `JREBEL_BASE_DIR/lib/libjrebel64.so` to `PROJECT_ARTIFACT_ID-platform-docker/src/main/docker` folder in case of the All-In-One archetype or `PROJECT_ARTIFACT_ID/src/main/docker` folder in case of the Platform Jar archetype.
2. Modify the file `PROJECT_ARTIFACT_ID-platform-docker/src/main/docker/Dockerfile` to copy the JRebel files into the platform container:

    ```bash
    # Hot reload - JRebel
    COPY jrebel.jar /jrebel.jar
    COPY libjrebel64.so /libjrebel64.so
    ```

3. Modify the file `docker/docker-compose.yml` to change the `CATALINA_OPTS` environment property to use the JRebel agent and the remote plugin. Add the command to avoid executing Tomcat with the Security Manager enabled (it makes the hot reloading tools to fail):

    ```text
    sample-project-acs:
        image: alfresco-content-services-sample-project:development
        build:
          dockerfile: ./Dockerfile
          context: ../../../sample-project-platform-docker/target
        environment:
          CATALINA_OPTS: "-agentlib:jdwp=transport=dt_socket,server=y,suspend=n,address=8888 -agentpath:/libjrebel64.so -Drebel.remoting_plugin=true"
        command: ["catalina.sh", "run"]
        ports:
          - "${acs.port}:8080"
          - "${acs.debug.port}:8888"
        volumes:
          - alf-acs-volume:/usr/local/tomcat/alf_data
        depends_on:
          - sample-project-postgres
    ```

##### Reloading changes in source code

1. Rebuild and restart the whole project (`run.sh/run.bat build_start`).

    You'll recognize JRebel is working when you see similar log messages:

2. Before making any changes, let's run the sample webscript by opening your browser and typing `http://localhost:8080/alfresco/s/sample/helloworld`.

    This is a sample webscript generated in every project created using SDK 4.0 and the platform artifact.
    
    ![sdk-hellofromjava]({% link content-services/images/sdk-hellofromjava.png %})

3. Locate `HelloWorldWebScript.java` in the `src/main/java/.../platformsample` folder of your project (If you are using an All-In-One project, the folder is located in the platform sub-project).

4. Edit it using your preferred editor and change the code so that `HelloFromJava` becomes `HelloFromMe`:

    ```java
    model.put(“fromJava”,”HelloFromMe”);
    ```

5. Save the file and compile the Java class (using your preferred IDE or the `mvn compile` command).

    A number of log messages appear in the Alfresco project terminal, for example:
    
    ```text
    ... JRebel: Reloading class 'com.example.platformsample.HelloWorldWebScript'.
    ... JRebel: Reconfiguring bean 'webscript.alfresco.tutorials.helloworld.get' 
    [com.example.platformsample.HelloWorldWebScript]
    ```

6. Refresh the browser to see the updated message:

    ![sdk-hellofromme]({% link content-services/images/sdk-hellofromme.png %})

By changing the code and compiling it again, the changes have been dynamically received from Content Services.

#### How to configure and use Hotswap Agent {#hotreloadinghotswapagent}

[HotSwapAgent](http://hotswapagent.org/index.html){:target="_blank"} is the agent that enables you to do hot reloading. This allows you to modify the application code, and 
view the changes without having to restart Alfresco Tomcat (or the ACS Docker container).

A prerequisite for this tutorial is to have a project created with the Alfresco SDK 4.1, using the All-In-One archetype or the Platform JAR archetype. It's 
worth noting that hot reloading is only supported on the platform, and not in Alfresco Share.

As an alternative to the HotSwapAgent you can also try out JRebel. It has more features but isn't free.

The way to configure HotSwapAgent in case of using Java 8 or Java 11 is pretty different. By default, ACS 6.0 uses Java 8 and ACS 6.1+ uses Java 11.

##### Issue with Docker Toolbox

It's worth noting that the HotSwapAgent's hot reloading mechanism is not working for [Docker Toolbox](https://docs.docker.com/toolbox/toolbox_install_windows/){:target="_blank"} 
at the moment. Docker Toolbox is for older Mac and Windows systems that do not meet the requirements of [Docker for Mac](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/){:target="_blank"} 
and [Docker for Windows](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/){:target="_blank"}.

This is due to an issue with the component used by HotSwapAgent to notify the changes in the compiled class files. HotSwapAgent uses the class 
[WatcherNIO2.java](https://github.com/HotswapProjects/HotswapAgent/blob/master/hotswap-agent-core/src/main/java/org/hotswap/agent/watch/nio/WatcherNIO2.java){:target="_blank"} to 
watch for the changes in the `extraClasspath` folder. That class is based on the Java class [WatchDir.java](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/io/examples/WatchDir.java){:target="_blank"} 
that, in Linux systems, is implemented using [inotify](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/inotify.7.html){:target="_blank"}. It seems that inotify is not working properly
with mounted volumes over Docker Toolbox (which internally uses VirtualBox).
 
You can track the evolution of this issue [here](https://github.com/moby/moby/issues/18246){:target="_blank"}. 

##### Configuring HotSwapAgent in the project (Java 8)

1. Modify the file `PROJECT_ARTIFACT_ID-platform-docker/src/main/docker/Dockerfile` to copy the HotSwapAgent configuration file into the ACS container classpath:

    ```bash
    # Hot reload - Hotswap agent
    COPY hotswap-agent.properties $TOMCAT_DIR/webapps/alfresco/WEB-INF/classes
    ```

2. Modify the file `PROJECT_ARTIFACT_ID-platform-docker/src/main/docker/Dockerfile` to append the commands to install and configure [DCEVM](http://dcevm.github.io/){:target="_blank"} and the HotSwapAgent java agent in the ACS container:

    ```bash
    # Download and Install the more capable DCEVM, which will allow more changes to classes, such as new methods
    RUN mkdir -p dcevm \
        && curl -L -o dcevm/DCEVM-8u181-installer.jar "https://github.com/dcevm/dcevm/releases/download/light-jdk8u181%2B2/DCEVM-8u181-installer-build2.jar" \
        && cd dcevm \
        && jar -xvf DCEVM-8u181-installer.jar \
        && cp linux_amd64_compiler2/product/libjvm.so /usr/java/default/jre/lib/amd64/server
    
    # Download HotSwap Agent - it is used in the Docker Compose file.
    RUN cd /usr/local/tomcat \
        && mkdir -p hotswap-agent \
        && curl -L -o lib/hotswap-agent-1.3.0.jar "https://github.com/HotswapProjects/HotswapAgent/releases/download/RELEASE-1.3.0/hotswap-agent-1.3.0.jar"
    ```

3. Modify the file `docker/docker-compose.yml` to change the ACS container `CATALINA_OPTS` environment property to use the HotSwap java agent:

    ```text
      sample-project-acs:
        image: alfresco-content-services-sample-project:development
        build:
          dockerfile: ./Dockerfile
          context: ../../../sample-project-platform-docker/target
        environment:
          CATALINA_OPTS: "-agentlib:jdwp=transport=dt_socket,server=y,suspend=n,address=8888 -javaagent:/usr/local/tomcat/lib/hotswap-agent-1.3.0.jar"
    ...
    ```

4. Modify the file `docker/docker-compose.yml` to change the ACS container command to avoid the execution of Tomcat with the Security Manager enabled (it makes the hot reloading tools fail):

    ```text
      sample-project-acs:
        image: alfresco-content-services-sample-project:development
        build:
          dockerfile: ./Dockerfile
          context: ../../../sample-project-platform-docker/target
        environment:
          CATALINA_OPTS: "-agentlib:jdwp=transport=dt_socket,server=y,suspend=n,address=8888 -javaagent:/usr/local/tomcat/lib/hotswap-agent-1.3.0.jar"
        command: ["catalina.sh", "run"]
    ...
    ```

5. Modify the file `docker/docker-compose.yml` to mount the target folders into the folder `/usr/local/tomcat/hotswap-agent` inside the ACS container:

    ```text
      sample-project-acs:
        image: alfresco-content-services-sample-project:development
        build:
          dockerfile: ./Dockerfile
          context: ../../../sample-project-platform-docker/target
        environment:
          CATALINA_OPTS: "-agentlib:jdwp=transport=dt_socket,server=y,suspend=n,address=8888 -javaagent:/usr/local/tomcat/lib/hotswap-agent-1.3.0.jar"
        command: ["catalina.sh", "run"]
        ports:
          - "${acs.port}:8080"
          - "${acs.debug.port}:8888"
        volumes:
          - alf-acs-volume:/usr/local/tomcat/alf_data
          - ../../../sample-project-platform/target/classes:/usr/local/tomcat/hotswap-agent/sample-project-platform/target/classes
          - ../../../sample-project-integration-tests/target/test-classes:/usr/local/tomcat/hotswap-agent/sample-project-integration-tests/target/test-classes
    ...
    ```

For more information about HotSwapAgent configuration for Java 8, please check the [HotSwapAgent documentation](http://hotswapagent.org/mydoc_quickstart.html){:target="_blank"}.

##### Configuring HotSwapAgent in the project (Java 11)

Using Java 11 and HotSwapAgent, it isn't necessary to configure the java agent and the alternative JVM as in previous versions. Instead, it is required 
to use an alternative pre-built JDK distribution. That JDK is based on OpenJDK and includes all the required modifications to run the HotSwapAgent properly.

In the context of the Alfresco SDK 4.1, this change is an issue because the JDK installation is inherited from the [Alfresco java docker image](https://github.com/Alfresco/alfresco-docker-base-java){:target="_blank"}. 
It is necessary to modify the project ACS docker image to change the default java installation of the container's OS to the one provided by HotSwapAgent.

A way to implement the required modifications would be:

1. Download the last release of the Trava OpenJDK (Linux distribution) from [here](https://github.com/TravaOpenJDK/trava-jdk-11-dcevm/releases){:target="_blank"} and save it into the folder `PROJECT_ARTIFACT_ID-platform-docker/src/main/docker`.
2. Modify the file `PROJECT_ARTIFACT_ID-platform-docker/src/main/docker/Dockerfile` to append the commands required to install and configure the custom JDK for the HotSwapAgent:

    ```bash
    # HOTSWAP AGENT
    # Install and configure Trava OpenJDK (OpenJDK pre-built with DCEVM and hotswap agent for Java 11)
    COPY trava-jdk-11-dcevm.tar.gz $TOMCAT_DIR
    RUN tar -xvf $TOMCAT_DIR/trava-jdk-11-dcevm.tar.gz -C /usr/java/ && \
        rm $TOMCAT_DIR/trava-jdk-11-dcevm.tar.gz && \
        alternatives --install /usr/bin/java java /usr/java/dcevm-11.0.1+7/bin/java 40000 && \
        alternatives --install /usr/bin/javac javac /usr/java/dcevm-11.0.1+7/bin/javac 40000 && \
        alternatives --install /usr/bin/jar jar /usr/java/dcevm-11.0.1+7/bin/jar 40000 && \
        alternatives --set java /usr/java/dcevm-11.0.1+7/bin/java && \
        alternatives --set javac /usr/java/dcevm-11.0.1+7/bin/javac && \
        alternatives --set jar /usr/java/dcevm-11.0.1+7/bin/jar && \
        ln -sfn /usr/java/dcevm-11.0.1+7 /usr/java/latest && \
        ln -sfn /usr/java/dcevm-11.0.1+7 /usr/java/default
    ```

3. Modify the file `PROJECT_ARTIFACT_ID-platform-docker/src/main/docker/Dockerfile` to copy the HotSwapAgent configuration file into the ACS container classpath:

    ```bash
    # Copy the configuration properties file in the classpath
    COPY hotswap-agent.properties $TOMCAT_DIR/webapps/alfresco/WEB-INF/classes
    ```

4. Modify the file `docker/docker-compose.yml` to change the ACS container command to avoid the execution of Tomcat with the Security Manager enabled (it makes the hot reloading tools fail):

    ```text
      sample-project-acs:
        image: alfresco-content-services-sample-project:development
        build:
          dockerfile: ./Dockerfile
          context: ../../../sample-project-platform-docker/target
        environment:
          CATALINA_OPTS: "-agentlib:jdwp=transport=dt_socket,server=y,suspend=n,address=8888"
        command: ["catalina.sh", "run"]
    ...
    ```

5. Modify the file `docker/docker-compose.yml` to mount the target folders into the folder `/usr/local/tomcat/hotswap-agent` inside the ACS container:

    ```text
      sample-project-acs:
        image: alfresco-content-services-sample-project:development
        build:
          dockerfile: ./Dockerfile
          context: ../../../sample-project-platform-docker/target
        environment:
          CATALINA_OPTS: "-agentlib:jdwp=transport=dt_socket,server=y,suspend=n,address=8888"
        command: ["catalina.sh", "run"]
        ports:
          - "${acs.port}:8080"
          - "${acs.debug.port}:8888"
        volumes:
          - alf-acs-volume:/usr/local/tomcat/alf_data
          - ../../../sample-project-platform/target/classes:/usr/local/tomcat/hotswap-agent/sample-project-platform/target/classes
          - ../../../sample-project-integration-tests/target/test-classes:/usr/local/tomcat/hotswap-agent/sample-project-integration-tests/target/test-classes
    ...
    ```

Instead of downloading the Trava OpenJDK distribution file and copying it to the container, the Dockerfile script could include directly the download of the 
file (via `curl` for instance), but that would slow down the creation of the ACS image each time it is rebuilt.

###### Creating a custom HotSwapAgent ACS docker image

Another alternative to avoid this time overhead, due to the installation of the Trava OpenJDK distribution, is to create a custom docker image that installs 
and sets that custom JDK up.

A sample `Dockerfile` for that custom image for ACS 6.0 Community could be:

```bash
FROM alfresco/alfresco-content-repository-community:6.0.7-ga

# HOTSWAP AGENT
# Install and configure Trava OpenJDK (OpenJDK pre-built with DCEVM and hotswap agent for Java 11)
COPY trava-jdk-11-dcevm.tar.gz $TOMCAT_DIR
RUN tar -xvf $TOMCAT_DIR/trava-jdk-11-dcevm.tar.gz -C /usr/java/ && \
    rm $TOMCAT_DIR/trava-jdk-11-dcevm.tar.gz && \
    alternatives --install /usr/bin/java java /usr/java/dcevm-11.0.1+7/bin/java 40000 && \
    alternatives --install /usr/bin/javac javac /usr/java/dcevm-11.0.1+7/bin/javac 40000 && \
    alternatives --install /usr/bin/jar jar /usr/java/dcevm-11.0.1+7/bin/jar 40000 && \
    alternatives --set java /usr/java/dcevm-11.0.1+7/bin/java && \
    alternatives --set javac /usr/java/dcevm-11.0.1+7/bin/javac && \
    alternatives --set jar /usr/java/dcevm-11.0.1+7/bin/jar && \
    ln -sfn /usr/java/dcevm-11.0.1+7 /usr/java/latest && \
    ln -sfn /usr/java/dcevm-11.0.1+7 /usr/java/default
```

That docker image can be built and pushed to your company Docker registry.

* Go to the folder where the `Dockerfile` is located and build the docker image:

```bash
> docker build -t "alfresco/alfresco-content-repository-community-hotswap-agent:6.0.7-ga" .
```

* Tag and push the image to your company Docker registry:

```bash
> docker tag DOCKER_REGISTRY_URL/alfresco/alfresco-content-repository-community-hotswap-agent:6.0.7-ga alfresco/alfresco-content-repository-community-hotswap-agent:6.0.7-ga
> docker push DOCKER_REGISTRY_URL/alfresco/alfresco-content-repository-community-hotswap-agent:6.0.7-ga
```

Once the new image is available in the Docker registry, the maven property `docker.acs.image` can be modified in the main `pom.xml` file of the project to use 
that custom image:

```xml
<docker.acs.image>alfresco/alfresco-content-repository-community-hotswap-agent</docker.acs.image>
```

For more information about HotSwapAgent configuration for Java 11, please check the [HotSwapAgent documentation](http://hotswapagent.org/mydoc_quickstart-jdk11.html){:target="_blank"}.

##### Reloading changes in source code

1. Rebuild and restart the whole project (`run.sh/run.bat build_start`).

    You'll recognize HotSwapAgent is working when you see similar log messages:
    
    ```text
     HOTSWAP AGENT: 14:08:07.154 DEBUG (org.hotswap.agent.util.classloader.URLClassLoaderHelper) - Added extraClassPath URLs [file:/usr/local/tomcat/hotswap-agent/] to classLoader ParallelWebappClassLoader
       context: alfresco
       delegate: false
     ----------> Parent Classloader:
     java.net.URLClassLoader@4c402120
    ```

2. Before making any changes, let's run the sample webscript by opening your browser and typing `http://localhost:8080/alfresco/s/sample/helloworld`.

    This is a sample webscript generated in every project created using SDK 4.1 and the platform artifact.

3. Locate `HelloWorldWebScript.java` in the `src/main/java/.../platformsample` folder of your project (If you are using an All-In-One project, the folder is located in the platform sub-project).

4. Edit it using your preferred editor and change the code so that `HelloFromJava` becomes `HelloFromMe`:

    ```java
    model.put(“fromJava”,”HelloFromMe”);
    ```

5. Save the file and compile the Java class (using your preferred IDE or the `mvn compile` command).

    A number of log messages appear in the Alfresco project terminal, for example:

By changing the code and compiling it again, the changes have been dynamically received from Content Services.

### Switching Content Services database

By default, the projects generated making use of the archetypes provided by the Alfresco SDK 4 are pre-configured to work with a specific database, which is 
PostgreSQL. 

Anyway, ACS is developed and tested to [support a wide range of platforms and languages]({% link content-services/6.2/support/index.md %}). 
That includes a set of supported databases.

In this article, we are going to detail the process to modify a project generated from the SDK's archetypes to use a different database. In this case, we're 
going to show how to configure a project to work with MySQL instead of PostgreSQL.

So, the steps to configure a MySQL database in an All-In-One project are:

1. Modify the `Dockerfile` of the platform module (`PROJECT_ROOT_PATH/PROJECT_ARTIFACT_ID-platform-docker/src/main/docker/Dockerfile`) to add the MySQL driver library to the tomcat lib folder:

    ```
    FROM ${docker.acs.image}:${alfresco.platform.version}
    ...
    # Copy MySQL driver to Tomcat lib folder
    RUN curl -L -o $TOMCAT_DIR/lib/mysql-db-connector.jar "https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/mysql/mysql-connector-java/5.1.47/mysql-connector-java-5.1.47.jar"
    ``` 
    
    If you've created a corporate ACS Docker image extending the official one, you can include the download and installation of the MySQL driver in that Docker
    image to avoid this installation on every compilation of the project.

2. Modify the ACS configuration to use the MySQL driver and connection URL. This configuration is set in the file `PROJECT_ROOT_PATH/PROJECT_ARTIFACT_ID-platform-docker/src/main/docker/alfresco-global.properties`:

    ```
    db.driver=com.mysql.jdbc.Driver
    db.url=jdbc:mysql://sample-aio-mysql:3306/alfresco?useUnicode=yes&characterEncoding=UTF-8&useSSL=false
    ```
    
    Remember that the database URL must contain the name of the MySQL container configured in the Docker compose file.

3. Modify the Docker compose file (`PROJECT_ROOT_PATH/docker/docker-compose.yml`) to delete the PostgreSQL container and configure the new MySQL container:

    ```text
    version: '3.4'
    services:
    ...
      sample-aio-mysql:
        image: mysql:5.7
        command: mysqld --character-set-server=utf8
        environment:
          MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: root
          MYSQL_DATABASE: alfresco
          MYSQL_USER: alfresco
          MYSQL_PASSWORD: alfresco
        expose:
          - "3306"
        volumes:
          - sample-aio-db-volume:/var/lib/mysql
    ...
    ```

4. Modify the Docker compose file (`PROJECT_ROOT_PATH/docker/docker-compose.yml`) to change the dependency of ACS container from the PostgreSQL container to the MySQL container:

    ```text
    version: '3.4'
    services:
    ...
      sample-aio-acs:
        image: alfresco-content-services-sample-aio:development
        build:
          dockerfile: ./Dockerfile
          context: ../../../sample-aio-platform-docker/target
        environment:
          CATALINA_OPTS: "-agentlib:jdwp=transport=dt_socket,server=y,suspend=n,address=0.0.0.0:8888"
        ports:
          - "${acs.port}:8080"
          - "${acs.debug.port}:8888"
        volumes:
          - sample-aio-acs-volume:/usr/local/tomcat/alf_data
        depends_on:
          - sample-aio-mysql
    ...
    ``` 

Once all these steps are done, remove all the old data from the project (`run.sh/run.bat purge`) and rebuild and restart the project 
(`run.sh/run.bat build_start`). That's everything required to switch from a PostgreSQL to a MySQL database. The process is the same with the rest of supported
databases.
 
## Troubleshooting {#troubleshooting}

This section describes a list of common issues with the projects generated from the Alfresco SDK 4.1 archetypes and the way to troubleshoot them.

### Incorrect JDK version

The ACS container is not starting properly and it is showing Java compatibility errors in the logs:

```text
org.springframework.beans.factory.CannotLoadBeanClassException: 
Error loading class [com.example.platformsample.Demo] for bean with name 'com.example.Demo' defined in class path resource 
[alfresco/module/sample-project-platform/context/service-context.xml]: 
problem with class file or dependent class; nested exception is java.lang.UnsupportedClassVersionError: 
com/example/platformsample/Demo has been compiled by a more recent version of the Java Runtime (class file version 55.0), 
this version of the Java Runtime only recognizes class file versions up to 52.0 (unable to load class [com.example.platformsample.Demo])
```

This error represents that the source code was compiled using the wrong version of the JDK. This issue can happen if the generated project is compiled using 
JDK 11 and it is deployed in an ACS 6.0 container (which uses JRE 8).

#### Solution

To solve this issue you can follow several approaches:

* Compile the project using a JDK version lower than 11 (and equal to or newer than 8).
* Remove the `java11` profile in the `pom.xml` file of the base project (this is not recommended if you plan to move to ACS 6.1 in the future).
* Move to ACS 6.1+. This is highly recommended due to the fact that it uses JRE 11 (JDK 8 has already reached its end of support time).

### Containers synchronization

ACS depends on the readiness of the database in order to start properly. If the database is not ready when ACS reaches the startup phase that requires it, then
it fails showing error messages in the log:

```text
sample-project-acs_1    | Jan 10, 2019 10:58:06 AM org.postgresql.core.v3.ConnectionFactoryImpl log

sample-project-acs_1    | 	at org.postgresql.jdbc.PgConnection.<init>(PgConnection.java:195)
...
```

The projects generated using the Alfresco SDK archetypes are configured in a way that the ACS container _depends on_ the database container (PostgreSQL). 

```text
services:
  sample-project-acs:
    image: alfresco-content-services-sample-project:development
    ...
    depends_on:
      - sample-project-postgres
  sample-project-postgres:
    image: postgres:9.6
    ...
``` 

The problem is Docker compose only ensures that the dependant container will be started before the one that declares the dependency. But that doesn't ensure 
that the PostgreSQL (or any other database) service will be ready when the ACS script reaches the point in which the database is required. 

Usually, the database service starts before ACS requires it, but there are some infrequent cases (an environment with low resources or high load) in which this
synchronization issue appears.

#### Solution

In these cases, you can follow the [recommendation in the official Docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/compose/startup-order/){:target="_blank"}, which is to use a 
scripting sync solution like _wait-for-it_ or _dockerize_.

Let's see how you can configure the ACS container to use [wait-for-it](https://github.com/vishnubob/wait-for-it){:target="_blank"} to wait for the database service to be ready 
to accept connections:

1. Download the last version of the [wait-for-it](https://github.com/vishnubob/wait-for-it){:target="_blank"} bash script and save it into the folder `PROJECT_ARTIFACT_ID-platform-docker/src/main/docker`.

2. Modify the file `PROJECT_ARTIFACT_ID-platform-docker/src/main/docker/Dockerfile` to include the addition of the script to the ACS container and granting execution permission to it.

    ```bash
    # Copy wait-for-it.sh script to wait for other services
    COPY wait-for-it.sh /tmp/wait-for-it.sh
    RUN chmod +x /tmp/wait-for-it.sh
    ```

4. Modify the file `docker/docker-compose.yml` to change the ACS container command to use the _wait-for-it_ script to wait for the PostgreSQL service to be ready.

    ```text
      sample-project-acs:
        image: alfresco-content-services-sample-project:development
        build:
          dockerfile: ./Dockerfile
          context: ../../../sample-project-platform-docker/target
        environment:
          CATALINA_OPTS: "-agentlib:jdwp=transport=dt_socket,server=y,suspend=n,address=0.0.0.0:8888"
        command: ["/tmp/wait-for-it.sh", "sample-project-postgres:5432", "--", "catalina.sh", "run"]
        ports:
          - "${acs.port}:8080"
          - "${acs.debug.port}:8888"
    ```

With this configuration in place, when the project is rebuilt and restarted the ACS container will wait for the database service to be ready.

### Ports conflict

The docker-based development environment started by a project generated using the Alfresco SDK archetypes exposes a set of different ports to the hosted 
machine (i.e. ACS http port, ACS debug port or PostgreSQL port). 

If one of these ports is already in use in the hosted machine (by another service) when you start the development environment, then the startup process will fail 
and the container that wanted to expose the busy port won't start.

#### Solution

The docker compose file under `docker/docker-compose.yml` is the source file that, in the compile phase of the project, will be filtered by the 
`maven-resource-plugin` in order to produce the final copy of the docker compose file.

That allows you to modify the number of the exposed ports through maven properties in the `pom.xml` file of the main project.

```xml
<!-- Environment configuration properties -->
<share.port>8180</share.port>
<share.debug.port>9898</share.debug.port>
<acs.port>8080</acs.port>
<acs.debug.port>8888</acs.debug.port>
<postgres.port>5555</postgres.port>
```

That way, if you face a port conflict, you only need to change the port in the corresponding maven property and rebuilt and restart the project.

### Alfresco Share previews / Transformations not working

Some files with different formats like _doc_, _docx_ or _xls_ can't be previewed in Alfresco Share. The source reason of this problem is that the Alfresco 
Transformation Service (ATS) is not working. ATS is required to generate the content renditions that will be used by Alfresco Share to show the content preview.

#### Solution

By default, ATS is not included in the basic configuration of the projects generated making use of the Alfresco SDK 4 archetypes.

To enable it, you simply need to follow the steps described in the article [How to set up Alfresco Transform Service](#setuptransformservice).
If you're working with Alfresco Enterprise you must also follow [this guide](#workingwithenterprise).
