title: Form Field Validation Handlers Extension Point
---

A validation handler is a small JavaScript function that gets called by the forms runtime when a field value needs to be validated.

Architecture Information: [Share Architecture]({% link content-services/6.2/develop/software-architecture.md %}#sharearchitecture)

## Description

The JavaScript function signature for a validation handler looks like this:

```javascript
/**
 * Validation handler for a field.
 * 
 * @param field {object} The element representing the field the validation is for
 * @param args {object} Object containing arguments for the handler
 * @param event {object} The event that caused this handler to be called, maybe null
 * @param form {object} The forms runtime class instance the field is being managed by
 * @param silent {boolean} Determines whether the user should be informed upon failure
 * @param message {string} Message to display when validation fails, maybe null
 * @static
 */
function handler-name(field, args, event, form, silent, message)   
```

The built in "mandatory" validation handler is defined as follows:

```javascript
Alfresco.forms.validation.mandatory = function mandatory(field, args, event, form, silent, message)
```

The `field` parameter is usually the HTML DOM element representing the field's value, which is normally an HTML input 
DOM element, so that the value property can be accessed. The structure of the `args` parameter is dependent on the 
handler being implemented. By default, these will be the parameters of the constraint defined on the field.

The handler is responsible for taking the value from the field and uses the `args` parameter to calculate whether the 
current value is valid or not, returning `true` if it is valid and `false` if it is not.

Now, to implement a validation handler you would need to first create a JavaScript function that does the validation. 
To do email address validation via RegExp, it could look something like this:

```javascript
if (typeof MyCustomNamespace == "undefined" || !MyCustomNamespace) {
    var MyCustomNamespace = {};
}

MyCustomNamespace.forms.validation.checkEmailValidity =
    function checkEmailValidity(field, args, event, form, silent, message) {
    var valid = true;

    valid = YAHOO.lang.trim(field.value).length !== 0;
    if (valid) {
        var re = /^([\w-]+(?:\.[\w-]+)*)@((?:[\w-]+\.)*\w[\w-]{0,66})\.([a-z]{2,6}(?:\.[a-z]{2})?)$/i;
        valid = re.test(field.value);
    }

    return valid;
}   
```

After this, make sure the JavaScript file is loaded when the form is loaded, which can be set as follows in 
`share-config-custom.xml` when defining the form:

```xml
<config>
    <forms>
        <dependencies>
            <js src="/js/email-form-field-validation-handler.js"/>
        </dependencies>
    </forms>
</config>
```

Then, use the field value validation handler as follows in the form definition:

```xml
<config><forms><form>
  ...
  <appearance>
    <field id="acme:emailAddress">
     <constraint-handlers>
       <constraint type="MANDATORY" validation-handler="MyCustomNamespace.forms.validation.checkEmailValidity" event="keyup"/>
     </constraint-handlers>
    </field>
```

## Deployment - App Server

Deploying field validation handlers directly into and Application server is not recommended as you would have to put 
files directly under tomcat/webapps/share/, and these files would then be gone as soon as the webapp is re-deployed or 
upgraded. It is better to use a Share JAR project.

## Deployment All-in-One SDK project

* `aio/share-jar/src/main/resources/META-INF/resources/share-jar/js/{custom path}` - validation handler JavaScript files
* `aio/share-jar/src/main/resources/META-INF/share-config-custom.xml` - form definitions with validation handlers
