title: Surf Root Objects Extension Point
---

A number of JavaScript root objects are available when you are implementing a controller for a Surf Web Script, such 
as `page` and `remote`. Sometimes you might have custom Java code that you want to call from JavaScript controllers, 
this is possible by adding custom JavaScript root objects.
