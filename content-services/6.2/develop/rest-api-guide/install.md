This page provides information about the Alfresco ReST API Explorer, how to install it and use it.

The Alfresco ReST API v1 is described in the OpenAPI specification format (formerly Swagger specification). This is 
good as lots of different tools can read this format, and you can also use the specification to generate ReST API clients 
in different languages, such as Java.

Alfresco uses the Alfresco ReST API OpenAPI specification to provide an [API Explorer](https://github.com/Alfresco/rest-api-explorer){:target="_blank"}, 
so you can easily read about all the APIs and try them out. The API Explorer comes in the format of a WAR file that 
needs to be installed (dropped) into your ACS installation.

If you just want to have a look at the latest API Explorer, then you can use an online version of it available here: 
[https://api-explorer.alfresco.com/api-explorer/](https://api-explorer.alfresco.com/api-explorer/){:target="_blank"}

## Installing

Most likely you would want to install the API Explorer into your local ACS installation. You can find the 
Alfresco API Explorer WAR file in [Alfresco’s Nexus repository](https://artifacts.alfresco.com/nexus/#nexus-search;quick~api-explorer){:target="_blank"}. 
Pick the version that closest matches your ACS installation.

To install the WAR file follow one of two approaches. If you are using a trial version of ACS then you follow the first 
approach described below. If you are using the [Alfresco SDK]({% link content-services/6.2/develop/sdk.md %}) 
you would want to follow the second approach. The main difference between the two is that the first one will lead to 
loss of the data that you are working with as the ACS trial Docker Compose file does not use volumes 
(i.e. it does not store data externally but instead inside the container).

### Installing the WAR file into an ACS Trial environment 

>**IMPORTANT!** you will lose your data/content when you do this)

1.  Create a directory somewhere for Repository extension files and copy the War file there

    Now, copy the WAR file, for example `api-explorer-6.2.0.war` into this new directory. Then rename the file to `api-explorer.war`.

2.  Create a `Dockerfile` for the new custom Repository Docker Image

    As a developer you are most likely running ACS 6.x via a Docker Compose file, either via trial or SDK. The `Dockerfile` 
    will be based on the Repository Image that is used in the `docker-compose.xml` file. Have a look in it and you should see 
    that it starts with defining the Alfresco Repository Docker image:
    
    ```text
    version: "2"
    
    services:
       alfresco:
           image: alfresco/alfresco-content-repository:6.2.0
           ...
    ```
    
    With this information we know what Docker Image to base our custom Repo Docker Image on. Create a `Dockerfile` in the same directory as the WAR file and have it look like this:
    
    ```text
    FROM alfresco/alfresco-content-repository:6.2.0
      
    ARG TOMCAT_DIR=/usr/local/tomcat
    
    # Copy the ReST API Explorer into the Tomcat Webapps directory
    COPY api-explorer.war $TOMCAT_DIR/webapps/
    ```
    
    What this `Dockerfile` will do is build a custom Repository Docker image that is based on the out-of-the-box Alfresco Repository Docker image that you are using. It will then copy in the `api-explorer.war` into the `tomcat/webapps` directory where it will be picked up and deployed.

3.  Build the custom Alfresco Repository Docker image

    When we got the Dockerfile completed we just need to build the custom Docker image as follows, standing in the directory with all the files:
    
    ```bash
    repo mbergljung$ docker build -t alf-repo-custom:1.0 .
    Sending build context to Docker daemon  954.4kB
    Step 1/3 : FROM alfresco/alfresco-content-repository:6.2.0
     ---> 5439a493ee0a
    Step 2/3 : ARG TOMCAT_DIR=/usr/local/tomcat
     ---> Using cache
     ---> cf2a1261adf4
    Step 3/3 : COPY api-explorer.war $TOMCAT_DIR/webapps/
     ---> Using cache
     ---> 52f10e1f00d6
    Successfully built 1766782c545a
    Successfully tagged alf-repo-custom:1.0
    ```
    
    Check that you got the custom Docker image:
    
    ```bash
    repo mbergljung$ docker image ls |grep alf-
    alf-repo-custom                                                  1.0                                          1766782c545a        About a minute ago   1.16GB
    ```

4.  Update the `docker-compose.xml` file to use the new custom image

    Open up the `docker-compose.xml` file and change it so the Repository service is based on the custom Docker Image we just created. It should now look something like this:
    
    ```text
    version: "2"
    
    services:
        alfresco:
            image: alf-repo-custom:1.0
            ...
    ```

5.  Restart ACS

    We have made changes only to the Repository container, also known as the **alfresco** Docker Compose service, but we need to remove and restart all containers so data is in sync (basically we are starting over with an empty repository). After we have created our own Docker Image for the Alfresco Repository container and configured Docker Compose with it we can restart as follows by doing **Ctrl-C** out of the log, this will stop all containers, we then remove them, followed by starting it up again:
    
    ```bash
    ^CGracefully stopping... (press Ctrl+C again to force)
    Stopping acs62_alfresco-pdf-renderer_1 ... done
    ...
    
    acs61 mbergljung$ docker-compose rm 
    Going to remove acs62_alfresco-pdf-renderer_1, acs62_transform-router_1, acs62_libreoffice_1, acs62_tika_1, acs62_imagemagick_1, acs62_proxy_1, acs62_share_1, acs62_postgres_1, acs62_digital-workspace_1, acs62_alfresco_1, acs62_activemq_1, acs62_solr6_1, acs62_shared-file-store_1
    Are you sure? [yN] y
    Removing acs62_alfresco-pdf-renderer_1 ... done
    ...
    
    acs61 mbergljung$ docker-compose up 
    Creating acs62_alfresco-pdf-renderer_1 ... done 
    ...           
    ```

### Installing the WAR file into an Alfresco SDK AIO project

1.  Copy API Explorer WAR file into the SDK project

    Copy the `api-explorer-6.2.0.war` into the `aio/aio-platform-docker/src/main/docker` AIO SDK directory. Then rename the file to `api-explorer.war`.

2.  Open up the platform/repository Docker file and add the command to copy the `api-explorer.war` into `tomcat/webapps`

    The platform (repository) `Dockerfile` is located in the `aio/aio-platform-docker/src/main/docker` AIO SDK directory. Add the following COPY command at the end of this file:
    
    ```text
    ...    
    # Copy the ReST API Explorer into the Tomcat Webapps directory
    COPY api-explorer.war $TOMCAT_DIR/webapps/
    ```
    
    What this Dockerfile will do is build a custom Repository Docker image that is based on the out-of-the-box Alfresco Repository Docker image that you are using. After it has copied in all the extensions, config files, license etc it will finish by copying in the `api-explorer.war` into the `tomcat/webapps` directory where it will be picked up and deployed.

3.  Restart the platform/repository container

    We have changed only the platform/repository, so it is enough to just restart this container:
    
    ```bash
    acs61-aio mbergljung$ ./run.sh reload_acs
    Killing docker_acs62-aio-acs_1 ... done
    Going to remove docker_acs61-aio-acs_1
    Removing docker_acs62-aio-acs_1 ... done
    ...
    ```

>**Note**. this does not remove any content or metadata.

### Accessing the API Explorer

You should now be able to access the API Explorer at [http://localhost:8080/api-explorer](http://localhost:8080/api-explorer/#/){:target="_blank"}:

![dev-api-by-language-alf-rest-api-explorer-1]({% link content-services/images/dev-api-by-language-alf-rest-api-explorer-1.png %})

## Getting started

You make API requests by sending a URL using one of five HTTP API methods, GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, and OPTIONS. Here's 
an example of a URL to get all sites in a local Alfresco installation:

```http
http://localhost:8080/alfresco/api/-default-/public/alfresco/versions/1/sites
```

You can use the ReST API Explorer to make this request:

* In your web browser, navigate to `[http://localhost:8080/api-explorer/#!/sites/listSites](http://localhost:8080/api-explorer/#!/sites/listSites)`. You'll see full documentation for the **GET /sites** API method, including the query and body parameter formats, and the expected and error response schemas.
* At the end of the description you'll see the **Try it out!** button. Press it now.

You've just made your first Alfresco ReST API request. You will see the request URL you've just invoked, the 
corresponding Curl command, the JSON response body that the Alfresco repository has returned, the HTTP response code, 
and the response headers: 

![dev-api-by-language-alf-rest-api-explorer-2]({% link content-services/images/dev-api-by-language-alf-rest-api-explorer-2.png %})

Note this call returns a list of site `entries`. All lists returned by the Alfresco ReST API are of this format.

## Install a tool to make HTTP calls {#http}

Information about the `cURL` command line tool that can be used to make HTTP calls.

When we have an ACS Server up and running we also need a tool that can be used to make HTTP requests to the server. 
The ReST API is accessed via HTTP and returns responses in JSON. We could use a Web Browser for all API calls that 
require HTTP GET, but lots of API calls will need a client that can execute HTTP POST and HTTP PUT operations.

So it is best to start working with a tool that can make HTTP GET, POST, and PUT calls.

One such tool is **cURL** and it is commonly available on most Linux based systems. Check if you have it by doing:

```bash
$ curl 
curl: try 'curl --help' or 'curl --manual' for more information
```

If you don’t have curl installed you can find it here: [https://curl.haxx.se/](https://curl.haxx.se/){:target="_blank"}

## Install a tool to format JSON responses {#json}

Information about the `jq` command line tool that can be used to format JSON responses.

The Alfresco ReST API will return responses in JSON format. When we work with the ReST API from the command line via 
cURL these JSON responses will not be formatted in a way that is easily readable.

So it would be good to feed it into some utility that could format the JSON. For this we can use a tool called **jq**. 
It can be found here: [https://stedolan.github.io/jq/](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/){:target="_blank"}. Install it and 
you should be ready to go with the rest of this section.

## Authenticate with the repository {#auth}

Before you can call any of the API endpoints, except a few that don't require authentication, you need to 
authenticate with the repository so your operations are executed on behalf of a specific user. When you authenticate 
successfully a ticket is returned that can be used in subsequent calls to the API. A ticket is valid for a specific time, 
so if you don't make any calls for a while, then you might get 401 errors back, which means you need to authenticate 
again to get a new ticket.

### Authenticating to get a ticket

To authenticate with the Repository the following URL is used, and it is part of the Authentication API:

`http://localhost:8080/alfresco/api/-default-/public/authentication/versions/1/tickets`

When calling this URL a HTTP POST should be used with the username and password as data:

```bash
$ curl --header "Content-Type: application/json" --request POST --data '{"userId":"admin","password":"admin"}' http://localhost:8080/alfresco/api/-default-/public/authentication/versions/1/tickets
{"entry":
  {"id":  "TICKET_08eb7e2e2c17964ca51f0f33186cc2fc9d56d593",
   "userId":"admin"
  }
}
```

Here I’m logging in as **admin** with password **admin**, which is common for local developer/test installations of ACS. 
But you can use any other username/password combination that represents a user in the Alfresco User database, being it 
local or linked to LDAP. However, it's good to use the **admin** user when you are playing around with the ReST API as 
you will almost always get a response back as you have full access. You don't have to worry about the user having the 
correct permissions to execute the call, having access to the content, etc. A ticket is return inside a JSON object.

We can make the POST call a bit shorter as `-H` is short for `--header` and `-d` for `--data`. The `-request POST` 
part is optional if you use `-d`, as the `-d` flag implies a POST request. So the call can also be executed as follows:

```bash
$ curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"userId":"admin","password":"admin"}' http://localhost:8080/alfresco/api/-default-/public/authentication/versions/1/tickets | jq
{  
  "entry": {    
    "id": "TICKET_08eb7e2e2c17964ca51f0f33186cc2fc9d56d593",    
    "userId": "admin"  
  }
}
```

You get the same ticket back if you call the API multiple times.

#### Windows users

Single quotes around JSON does not work on Windows, use double quotes instead:

```bash
curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d "{\"userId\":\"admin\",\"password\":\"admin\"}" http://localhost:8080/alfresco/api/-default-/public/authentication/versions/1/tickets
```

### Base64 encoding the ticket

When we have the ticket we need to base64 encode it before we can use it in subsequent calls:

#### On Mac and Linux

```bash
$ echo -n 'TICKET_08eb7e2e2c17964ca51f0f33186cc2fc9d56d593' | openssl base64
VElDS0VUXzA4ZWI3ZTJlMmMxNzk2NGNhNTFmMGYzMzE4NmNjMmZjOWQ1NmQ1OTM=
```

#### On Windows

```bash
powershell "[convert]::ToBase64String([Text.Encoding]::UTF8.GetBytes(\"TICKET_08eb7e2e2c17964ca51f0f33186cc2fc9d56d593\"))"
```

### Using the ticket

Now when we got a base64 encoded ticket, such as `VElDS0VUXzA4ZWI3ZTJlMmMxNzk2NGNhNTFmMGYzMzE4NmNjMmZjOWQ1NmQ1OTM=`, 
we can start using it in an API call. The way we use the ticket in a Curl call is to add it with the `Authorization` 
header as follows:

```bash
curl -X GET -H 'Accept: application/json' -H 'Authorization: Basic {ticket}' '{API endpoint URL}' | jq
```

With an example ticket and an example API endpoint it will look like this:

```bash
curl -X GET -H 'Accept: application/json' -H 'Authorization: Basic VElDS0VUXzA4ZWI3ZTJlMmMxNzk2NGNhNTFmMGYzMzE4NmNjMmZjOWQ1NmQ1OTM=' 'http://localhost:8080/alfresco/api/discovery' | jq
```

This ReST API Guide contains hundreds of examples of how to use a ticket with GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE calls.
