title: Install using Docker Compose
---

Use this information to quickly start up Content Services using Docker Compose. Due to the limited capabilities of Docker Compose, this deployment method is recommended for development and test environments only.

To deploy Content Services using Docker Compose`, download and install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/){:target="_blank"}, then follow the steps below. Make sure that you've reviewed the [prerequisites]({% link content-services/6.2/install/containers/index.md %}#prerequisites) before continuing.

1. Download the `docker-compose.yml` file by accessing the Content Services [Download Trial](https://www.alfresco.com/platform/content-services-ecm/trial/download){:target="_blank"} page, which will give you a 30-day license.

    If you already have a valid license file for Content Services 6.2, you can apply it directly to the running system. See [Uploading a new license]({% link content-services/6.2/admin/license.md %}) for more details.

    > **Note:** Make sure that exposed ports are open on your host computer. Check the `docker-compose.yml` file to determine the exposed ports - refer to the `host:container` port definitions. You'll see they include 5432, 8080, 8083 and others.

2. Save the `docker-compose.yml` file in a local folder.

    For example, you can create a folder `acs-trial`.

3. Change directory to the location of your `docker-compose.yml` file.

4. Log in to Quay.io using your credentials:

    ```bash
    docker login quay.io
    ```

    Alfresco customers can request Quay.io credentials by logging a ticket with [Alfresco Support](https://support.alfresco.com/){:target="_blank"}. These credentials are required to pull private (Enterprise-only) Docker images from Quay.io.

5. Deploy Content Services, including the repository, Share, Postgres database, Search Services, etc.:

    ```bash
    docker-compose up
    ```

    This downloads the images, fetches all the dependencies, creates each container, and then starts the system:

    ```text
    ...
    Creating acs-trial_digital-workspace_1  ... done
    Creating acs-trial_alfresco_1           ... done
    Creating acs-trial_activemq_1           ... done
    Creating acs-trial_share_1              ... done
    Creating acs-trial_solr6_1              ... done
    Creating acs-trial_shared-file-store_1  ... done
    Creating acs-trial_sync-service_1       ... done
    Creating acs-trial_postgres_1           ... done
    Creating acs-trial_proxy_1              ... done
    Creating acs-trial_transform-router_1   ... done
    Creating acs-trial_transform-core-aio_1 ... done
    Attaching to acs-trial_digital-workspace_1, acs-trial_shared-file-store_1, acs-trial_alfresco_1, acs-trial_sync-service_1, ...
    ...
    ```

    Note that the name of each container begins with the folder name you created in step 2.

    As an alternative, you can also start the containers in the background by running `docker-compose up -d`.

6. Wait for the logs to complete, showing messages:

    ```bash
    ...
    alfresco_1 | 2020-07-06 11:50:46,808  WARN ... The Alfresco Content Services license will expire in 2 days.
    ...
    alfresco_1 | 2020-07-06 11:50:50,938  INFO ... Starting 'Transformers' subsystem, ID: [Transformers, default]
    alfresco_1 | 2020-07-06 11:50:50,371  INFO ... Startup of 'Transformers' subsystem, ID: [Transformers, default] complete
    ...
    ```

    See [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) if you encounter errors whilst the system is starting up.

7. Open your browser and check everything starts up correctly:

    | Service | Endpoint |
    | ------- | -------- |
    | Administration and REST APIs | `http://localhost:8080/alfresco` |
    | Share | `http://localhost:8080/share` |
    | Digital Workspace | `http://localhost:8080/workspace` |
    | Search Services administration | `http://localhost:8083/solr` |
    | Sync Service health check | `http://localhost:9090/alfresco/healthcheck` |

    If Docker is running on your local machine, the IP address will be just `localhost`.

    If you're using the [Docker Toolbox](https://docs.docker.com/toolbox/toolbox_install_windows/){:target="_blank"}, run the following command to find the IP address:

    ```bash
    docker-machine ip
    ```

8. Log in as the `admin` user. Enter the default administrator password `admin`.

## Check system start up

Use this information to verify that the system started correctly, and to clean up the deployment.

1. Open a new terminal window.

2. Change directory to the `docker-compose` folder that you created in the deployment steps.

3. Verify that all the services started correctly.

    1. List the images and additional details:

        ```bash
        docker-compose images
        ```

        You should see a list of the services defined in your `docker-compose.yaml` file:

        ```text
                Container                           Repository                            ...       Size
        --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
        acs-trial_activemq_1                alfresco/alfresco-activemq                    ...   545.9 MB
        acs-trial_alfresco_1                alfresco/alfresco-content-repository          ...   1.324 GB
        acs-trial_digital-workspace_1       quay.io/alfresco/alfresco-digital-workspace   ...   34.35 MB
        acs-trial_postgres_1                postgres                                      ...   312.5 MB
        acs-trial_proxy_1                   alfresco/alfresco-acs-nginx                   ...   20.42 MB
        acs-trial_share_1                   alfresco/alfresco-share                       ...   867.6 MB
        acs-trial_shared-file-store_1       alfresco/alfresco-shared-file-store           ...   777.8 MB
        acs-trial_solr6_1                   alfresco/alfresco-search-services             ...   1.022 GB
        acs-trial_sync-service_1            quay.io/alfresco/service-sync                 ...   809.7 MB
        acs-trial_transform-core-aio_1      alfresco/alfresco-transform-core-aio          ...   1.707 GB
        acs-trial_transform-router_1        quay.io/alfresco/alfresco-transform-router    ...   729.8 MB
        ```

    2. List the running containers:

        ```bash
        docker-compose ps
        ```

        You should see a list of the services defined in the `docker-compose.yaml` file.

    3. View the log files for each service `<service-name>`, or container `<container-name>`:

        ```bash
        docker-compose logs <service-name>
        docker container logs <container-name>
        ```

        For example, to check the logs for Share, run any of the following commands:

        ```bash
        docker-compose logs share
        docker container logs acs-trial_share_1
        ```

        You can add an optional parameter `--tail=25` before `<container-name>` to display the last 25 lines of the logs for the selected container.

        ```bash
        docker-compose logs --tail=25 share
        docker container logs --tail=25 acs-trial_share_1
        ```

        Check for a success message:

        ```text
        Successfully retrieved license information from Alfresco.
        ```

    Once you've tested the services, you can clean up the deployment by stopping the running services.

4. Stop the session by using `CONTROL+C` in the same window as the running services:

    ```text
    ^CGracefully stopping... (press Ctrl+C again to force)
    Stopping acs-trial_transform-core-aio_1 ... done
    Stopping acs-trial_transform-router_1   ... done
    Stopping acs-trial_proxy_1              ... done
    Stopping acs-trial_sync-service_1       ... done
    Stopping acs-trial_shared-file-store_1  ... done
    Stopping acs-trial_postgres_1           ... done
    Stopping acs-trial_activemq_1           ... done
    Stopping acs-trial_share_1              ... done
    Stopping acs-trial_solr6_1              ... done
    Stopping acs-trial_alfresco_1           ... done
    Stopping acs-trial_digital-workspace_1  ... done
    ```

5. Alternatively, you can open a new terminal window, change directory to the `docker-compose` folder, and run:

    ```bash
    docker-compose down
    ```

    This stops the running services, as shown in the previous example, and removes them from memory:

    ```text
    Stopping acs-trial_transform-core-aio_1 ... done
    Stopping acs-trial_transform-router_1   ... done
    ...
    Removing acs-trial_transform-core-aio_1 ... done
    Removing acs-trial_transform-router_1   ... done
    Removing acs-trial_proxy_1              ... done
    Removing acs-trial_sync-service_1       ... done
    Removing acs-trial_shared-file-store_1  ... done
    Removing acs-trial_postgres_1           ... done
    Removing acs-trial_activemq_1           ... done
    Removing acs-trial_share_1              ... done
    Removing acs-trial_solr6_1              ... done
    Removing acs-trial_alfresco_1           ... done
    Removing acs-trial_digital-workspace_1  ... done
    Removing network acs-trial_default
    ```

6. You can use a few more commands to explore the services when they're running. Change directory to `docker-compose` before running these:

    1. Stop all the running containers:

        ```bash
        docker-compose stop
        ```

    2. Restart the containers (after using the `stop` command):

        ```bash
        docker-compose restart
        ```

    3. Starts the containers that were started with `docker-compose up`:

        ```bash
        docker-compose start
        ```

    4. Stop all running containers, and remove them and the network:

        ```bash
        docker-compose down [--rmi all]
        ```

        The `--rmi all` option also removes the images created by `docker-compose up`, and the images used by any service. You can use this, for example, if any containers fail and you need to remove them:

        ```text
        Stopping acs-trial_transform-core-aio_1 ... done
        ...
        Removing acs-trial_transform-core-aio_1 ... done
        ...
        Removing network acs-trial_default
        Removing image alfresco/alfresco-content-repository:6.2.2
        Removing image ...
        ```

See the [Docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/){:target="_blank"} for more on using Docker.

### Deployment project in GitHub

See the [Alfresco/acs-deployment](https://github.com/Alfresco/acs-deployment/tree/support/SP/4.N){:target="_blank"} GitHub project for more details.

* In this project, you'll find several Docker Compose files. The default `docker-compose.yml` file contains the latest work-in-progress deployment scripts, and installs the latest *development* version of Content Services.
* To deploy a specific released version of Content Services, several *major.minor* Docker Compose files are provided in the `docker-compose` folder of the project.
* To modify your development environment, for example to change or mount files in the existing images, you'll have to create new custom Docker images (recommended approach). The same approach applies if you want to install AMP files into the repository and Share images. See the [Customization guidelines]({% link content-services/6.2/install/containers/customize.md %}) for more.

Using one of the Enterprise Compose files in this project deploys the following system:

## Customize

To customize the Docker Compose deployment, for example applying AMPs, we recommend following the best practice of creating your own custom Docker image(s). The [Customization guidelines]({% link content-services/6.2/install/containers/customize.md %}) walks you through this process.

## Cleanup

To bring the system down and cleanup the containers run the following command:

```bash
docker-compose down
```

## Troubleshooting

1. If you have issues running ```docker-compose up``` after deleting a previous Docker Compose cluster, try replacing step 4 in the initial Docker Compose instructions with:

    ```bash
    docker-compose down && docker-compose build --no-cache && docker-compose up
    ```

2. Stop the session by using `CONTROL+C`.

3. Remove the containers (using the `--rmi all` option):

    ```bash
    docker-compose down --rmi all
    ```

4. Try allocating more memory resources, as advised in `docker-compose.yml`.

    For example, in Docker, change the memory setting in **Preferences** (or **Settings**) **Resources** > **Advanced** > **Memory** to at least 8GB. Make sure you restart Docker and wait for the process to finish before continuing.

    Go back to step 5 in the initial Docker Compose instructions to start the deployment again.

> **Note:** You'll need a machine with at least 13GB of memory to distribute among the Docker containers.
