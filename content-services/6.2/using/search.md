You can use the search box on the toolbar to search for files, sites, and people.

Type your search into the search box, and a list of matching files, sites, and people will be shown as you type.

If you're in a site you can click **Search all content** or **Search in ***sitename***** to search all sites or just the site you're in. Private sites that you're not a member of, and their files, aren't shown.

There are lots of [search tips](#searchtips) available, including:

* Type `*` to complete a word if you don't know the full word you're searching for. For example, both `*resco` and `alf*` will show results for `alfresco`.
* To search for items that contain only one of several words, use `OR` and surround your search with brackets, for example, `(big OR red)`. If you don't use brackets, search results are returned containing both `big` and `red`.

The five most relevant files, sites, and people are shown, but you can click **More** to see further results.

You can either:

* Click on one of the results to go straight to it, or
* Press Enter (with the cursor in the search box) to view all the [search results](#searchresults) for all files found by your search.

> **Note:** Wiki pages and blog postings are shown under along with other files. Previews aren't shown for calendar events, site-related web links, discussion topics, or data lists and list items. You need to press Enter to search for them.

## Search results {#searchresults}

If you press Enter in the Search box then all the files and folders found by your search are shown.

    You can delete a file this way but the search results won't be updated until you run a new search.

> **Note:** Click the **Search in** menu to search in all sites or just in the site you're in.

If you're a [Search Manager]({% link content-services/6.2/using/permissions.md %}#searchmanager) super user then you'll have an additional **Search Manager** option you can click where you can create new search filters.

As well as the search box on the toolbar, there are also additional advanced search features for finding [people](#peoplefinder), [sites](#sitefinder), and [content](#advancedsearch).

> **Tip:** If a file is a Microsoft Office, PDF, or other text-based file type (not an image or video) then you can also click ![Advanced Search icon]({% link content-services/images/advanced-search-icon.png %}) on the file preview to search for text in the file.

## Using the Site Finder {#sitefinder}

3. Click **Search**.

    A list of sites matching your criteria is shown. This list includes public sites, moderated public sites, sites you created, and private sites that you belong to. To the right of a site, the actions **Join** and **Request to Join** indicate you are not a site member; the action **Leave** indicates you are a site member.

* **Following (#)**: Displays a list of people the user is following.The number to the right of the page label indicates how many people are currently being followed by this user. If the user has marked their list as private, this page will not appear in the profile.
