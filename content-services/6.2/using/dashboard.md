You can customize your user profile and dashboard however you like without affecting anyone else - you're the only person that sees your dashboard.

Some of your user profile details are visible to your colleagues so it's good to keep these details up to date.

## Customizing your dashboard

You can change the layout of your dashboard and choose from a number of dashlets to show the information you want to see.

If you want, add multiple copies of each dashlet and then set the filters so that each one displays different information.

>**Note:** The Get Started panel links to the Alfresco Share Help where you can watch help videos. You can always **Hide** it and show it again later.

1. Click ![Customize Dashboard icon]({% link content-services/images/settings-icon.png %}) to start customizing your dashboard.

2. Change the dashboard layout:

    1. Click **Change Layout**.

    2. **Select** a layout.

3. To select your dashlets:

    1. Click **Add Dashlets**.

    2. Drag and drop dashlets from the Add Dashlets section onto the columns below.

        > **Note:** You can drag and drop dashlets around the columns to change the display order, or to the trash can (or press DELETE) to remove them.

        See [What can I do with my dashlets?]({% link content-services/6.2/using/index.md %}#whatcanidowithmydashlets) for more.

4. Select whether to show or hide the Get Started Panel.

5. Click **OK** to save the dashboard configuration.

    > **Tip:** On your dashboard you can resize most dashlets - just click on the bottom of a dashlet then drag up and down to resize it.

## Setting your home page {#sethomepage}

Your default Alfresco Share home page is your user dashboard, but you can set it to be any page in Share that you have access to.

This can save you time if most of your work is done from a specific Share location, by taking you straight to that screen every time you sign in.

1. Go to the page that you want to be your home page.

2. Click your user name and select **Use Current Page**.

    That's it. Now, every time you sign in Share will open on this page. You can change this whenever you want to or select **Use My Dashboard** to set your home page back to your dashboard.

    > **Note:** The **Home** option on the toolbar will also take you to the page that you've set as your home page.

    You can still click your name then **User Dashboard** to go to your dashboard.

    > **Note:** Sometimes the home page you've selected could become unavailable, for example, if you select a site dashboard as your home page and the site is then deleted. If this happens we'll notify you that you need to select a new home page.

## Updating your profile

User profiles help you to identify a user's roles and responsibilities, or even find out who's who in your organization by checking profile pictures.

When you click on your name at the top of the screen a menu opens where you can update profile details, change your password, search the help, and log out.

1. Click your user name and select **My Profile**, then **Edit Profile**.

    > **Note:** You can also select **View My Profile** from the **My Profile** dashlet.

2. Enter all the details that you want to show in your profile, including a picture if you want, then click **Save Changes**.

    > **Note:** If you already had a profile photo, uploading a new one overwrites it.

    If you enter a Google Username it will be used as the default account when you edit or create Google Docs.

3. Click **Home** and you can see the updated details in the **My Profile** dashlet.

When your colleagues view your profile they'll see all the details you've entered and know exactly what you're working on.

## Following people

You can follow users you're interested in so that you can easily keep track of what they've been working on.

1. Click **People** and search for a user.

    You can also follow users by clicking a user's name wherever you see it to display their profile page.

2. Click **Follow**.

    An email is sent telling the user that you're following them. You can't follow a user without them knowing.

3. Open the **I'm Following** page of your user profile.

    You see a list of the users you are following.

4. You can select the **Private** check box to hide your I'm Following page from other users.

    > **Note:** Even when your list is private, email notifications will be sent to people you choose to follow.

    When your list is private, the I'm Following page doesn't appear to people viewing your profile.

5. Click **Unfollow** to stop following someone.

## Controlling your email notifications

Choose whether or not you want to receive notifications by email. The emails keep you up to date on events such as recent site activities.

> **Note:** If you want to change the frequency of your email notifications, contact your Alfresco administrator.

1. Click your user name on the toolbar and click **My Profile**.

2. Select the **Notifications** page.

3. Enable or disable the **Email Notification Feed** option.

4. Click **OK**.

    > **Note:** You can also enable and disable the notifications for specific sites on the My Profile **Sites** page.

## Disabling site activity notifications

You can disable site activity feeds so that updates from specific sites aren't included in your email notifications or the My Activities dashlet on your dashboard.

1. Click your user name on the toolbar and click **My Profile**.

2. Select the **Sites** page.

    > **Note:** You can also access this page by clicking **Sites** then **My Sites** on the toolbar.

3. Click **Disable Activity Feeds** to disable updates for a site.

    You can do this for as many sites as you want, and you can click **Enable Activity Feeds** to switch feeds back on again.

    > **Note:** The My Documents dashlet will still display details of content from the sites you've disabled feeds for.

## Changing your password

Change your password for increased security.

1. Click your user name on the toolbar and click **Change Password**.

    > **Note:** This option might not be available if your company passwords are kept in an external password management system.

2. Type your current password in the **Enter Old Password** field.

3. Type your new password in the **Enter New Password** and **Confirm New Password** fields.

    Your password must be at least ten characters long and use a combination of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols.

4. Click **OK**.
