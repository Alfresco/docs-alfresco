Site managers can easily add and remove features by [customizing a site]({% link content-services/6.2/using/sites/index.md %}#customizesite)

Site members can create events that appear on the calendar for all site users to see. These events also display in the Site Calendar dashlet. You can view the calendar by day, week, or month. The Agenda view displays upcoming events.

### Accessing the calendar

Access the calendar to view upcoming events for the current site.

Within the calendar you can create events, as well as edit and delete any events that you created.

In a site click **More** then **Calendar**.

> **Note:** In each site the feature names can be customized. If the site manager has done this, the link might have a name other than **Calendar**.

    This opens the calendar which defaults to the Month view. Any events scheduled in the current month are displayed on the calendar.

### Browsing the calendar

The main view defaults to a calendar displaying the current month. The explorer panel to the left provides another calendar for navigating the months without affecting the main view.

1. In the calendar use the navigation buttons to change the main calendar view:

    b. Use the Previous ![Previous]({% link content-services/images/ico-cal-left.png %}) and Next ![Next]({% link content-services/images/ico-cal-right.png %}) buttons to move forward and backward through the calendar, either a day, week, or month at a time, depending on the current view.

    c. Click **Agenda** to view a list of the upcoming events scheduled for this site.

    d. Click **Today** to display the current date.

2. Use the calendar in the browsing pane to navigate through the months without affecting the main view.
