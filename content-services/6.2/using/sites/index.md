title: Overview of sites
---

A site is a area where you can share content and collaborate with other site members.

Any user can create a site. The site creator becomes the **Site Manager** by default, though additional or alternate managers can be added after this.

Each site has a visibility setting that marks the site as `public`, `moderated`, or `private`. This setting controls who can see the site and how users become site members.

|Site visibility|Description|
|---------------|-----------|
|Public site|All users can view the content but only site members can work with the content.<br><br>Any user can join the site.|
|Moderated site|All users can access the site but only site members can see and work with the content.<br><br>Users must ask to join the site.|
|Private site|Only site members can access the site.<br><br>Users must be added to the site by a site manager.|

The manager of any site, whether public or private, can add users.

>**Note:** The visibility setting of a site is displayed next to the site name when you're in the site.

You can remove yourself from a site at any time by clicking ![settings]({% link content-services/images/settings-icon.png %}) in the site and selecting **Leave Site**.

## Accessing existing sites

Accessing an existing site is easy.

You can search for sites using the Site Finder, the search box on the toolbar, or you might receive an email notification that you've been added to a site.

If you see a link to a site anywhere in Alfresco Share, just click the link to have a look.

You can see all the sites you're a member of by clicking **Sites** then **My Sites** on the Alfresco toolbar.

### Joining a site

When you join sites you gain access to the content that's stored on them.

> **Note:** You can see all the sites you're a member of on the **My Sites** dashlet or by clicking **Sites** then **My Sites** on the toolbar.

1. Click **Sites** to see your Recent Sites and the site tools available.

2. Click **Site Finder**.

3. Enter a search term and click **Search**.

    >**Note:** You can leave the search field empty to search for all available sites.

    All sites meeting your search criteria are now displayed. You have options to:

    * **Join** a public site
    * **Request to join** a moderated public site
    * **Leave** a site that you're a member of
    * **Delete** a site that you're a manager of

4. Click on a site to go straight to the site dashboard.

    > **Note:** Click ![Customize Dashboard icon]({% link content-services/images/settings-icon.png %}) to leave or join a site, depending on whether you're already a member or not. If you request to join a moderated site then site managers are notified and you'll need to wait until they give you access.

5. Click **Sites** and you can add or remove the current site from your favorite sites list.

    > **Note:** When you favorite a site you can quickly access it from the **Sites** menu.

### Leaving a site

It's quick and easy to leave a site when you no longer want to be a member.

1. On the dashboard of the site you want to leave, click ![settings]({% link content-services/images/settings-icon.png %}) then **Leave Site**.

2. Click **OK** to confirm that you want to leave the site.

    > **Note:** All sites require a site manager so if you're the only manager of a site you can't leave it. You can also leave a site by clicking **Leave** in the Site Finder.

### Entering a site

You can access a site from several places in Alfresco Share.

It's easy to get to sites you're a member of from the My Sites dashlet or by clicking **Sites** then **My Sites** on the toolbar. If the site you want to access isn't there, you can search for it on the Site Finder page, or in the search box on the toolbar.

1. Click **Home**.

2. On the My Sites dashlet click the name of the site you want to access.

    > **Tip:** You can access your favorite sites or recent sites you've visited by selecting them from the Sites menu. There's no need to return to your dashboard.

The dashboard for the selected site appears.

### Moving around a site

The default areas available in a site are the **Site Dashboard**, **Document Library**, and the **Site Members** areas. If a site has additional site features then you'll also see a **More** menu.

Additional features can be set up by a site manager when they're [customizing a site](#customizesite).

1. In a site click **Document Library**, **Site Members**, or **More** and select an option from the **More** menu.

    The site feature you've selected will open; see the links for further details on each of these.

    > **Note:** You can click **Site Dashboard** at any point to return to the site dashboard.

## Site dashboard

The site dashboard contains information specific to the current site, and like your user dashboard, site information is organized and displayed in dashlets.

The site name is displayed at the top of the screen. The site manager has additional options under the ![settings]({% link content-services/images/settings-icon.png %}) tools menu and an additional ![Invite to Site]({% link content-services/images/invite-to-site-icon.png %}) add users button to set up and manage the site and it's members.

Sites are made up of different features, or pages, which you can find under the **More** menu. Each new site includes only a library, but a site manager can customize the site to include any combination of pages, including a wiki, a blog, a calendar, a discussion forum, web links, and data lists.

> **Note:** Site managers can [choose a site homepage](#choosehomepage) other than the dashboard, or remove the dashboard altogether.

There's a **Site Members** link for managing the site membership.

> **Note:** When more features are added to a site you can find this option on the **More** menu.

A site manager can resize most dashlets by clicking and dragging on the bottom edge of the dashlet until it's the height you want. This is saved between sessions.

> **Note:** If you hover over a dashlet header then a ![Add Event icon]({% link content-services/images/help-1.png %}) icon appears. Click it for an explanation of what the dashlet does. This stays open until you close it or navigate away from the dashboard.

## Choosing a site homepage {#choosehomepage}

Site dashboards are the default homepage on all Alfresco Share sites.

Site managers have the option to remove the site dashboard for individual sites. Whichever page comes first in the Current Site Pages will then become the default homepage for the site. You can also keep the dashboard, but reorder the pages to that a different page is the homepage.

1. Enter a site.

2. Click ![settings]({% link content-services/images/settings-icon.png %}) then **Customize Site**.

    The Site Dashboard is shown by default as one of your Current Site Pages.

3. Click **Remove** to remove it from the site.

    Alternatively, change the order of the Current Site Pages so that a different page comes first (from left to right). This page will become the site homepage.

4. Click **OK** to save your changes.

The site displays with it's new homepage.

You can always add the site dashboard back later.

## What can I do with the site dashlets?

As well as giving you an overview of activity and information on Alfresco Share, the dashlets also give you links to various areas of Share and let you carry out a range of actions.

When a user name, site name, or item appears as a link, you can click it to navigate to the related page. When you hover over some dashlets additional options are displayed.

> **Note:** The RSS Feed, Alfresco Add-ons RSS Feed, and Web View site dashlets on the site dashboard are identical to those on your personal dashboard. The My Discussions, Site Search, and Saved Search dashlets are identical to those on your user dashboard, but on the site dashboard the results displayed are specific to the current site.

Any combination of the site dashlets can appear on the dashboard:

In earlier versions of Share users aren't added to a site until they've accepted the invitation that is sent when they're invited to join the site.
