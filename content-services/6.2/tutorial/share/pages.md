## Adding content to a Surf page {#addcontent}

**Extension Point**: [Surf Extension Modules]({% link content-services/6.2/develop/share-ext-points/surf-extension-modules.md %})

**Description**: 

This tutorial demonstrates how to add some extra content to the Footer on each page. The steps you need to take to do 
this can be applied also when adding content to other parts of a page.

**Implementation Steps**:

A simple and effective way to add content to a Surf page is to follow these steps:

1. Create a Web Script that returns the content to be displayed.
2. Find a page component that is located where you want to add new content, such as the footer in our case.
3. Add a new sub-component to the page component, referencing the new Web Script.
4. Use a Surf Extension module to deploy the new sub-component.

**Related Information**:

This tutorial assumes that you are familiar with the Spring Surf development framework. If you are new to it then read 
up on it [here]({% link content-services/6.2/develop/software-architecture.md %}#surf-framework) before starting this tutorial. 
If you have not already done so you should also review the [Introducing SurfBug]({% link content-services/6.2/develop/tools.md %}#surfbug) 
topic as this tool is used in this tutorial.

**Source Code**: [Go to code](https://github.com/Alfresco/alfresco-sdk-samples/tree/alfresco-51/all-in-one/add-page-content-share){:target="_blank"}

This tutorial assumes you have created a new [SDK All-In-One]({% link content-services/6.2/develop/sdk.md %}#workingaio) project.

Tutorial implementation steps:

1.  In the Share JAR project create a new directory as follows for the Web Script: `aio/aio-share-jar/src/main/resources/alfresco/web-extension/site-webscripts/org/alfresco/tutorials`.

2.  Add a Web Script descriptor file called `new-content.get.desc.xml` to the `/tutorials` directory:

    ```xml
    <webscript>
        <shortname>New Page Content</shortname>
        <description>Add new content to a Surf Page</description>
        <url>/tutorials/new-content</url>
        <family>Share Tutorials</family>
    </webscript>
    ```

3.  Add a web script template file called `new-content.get.html.ftl` to the `/tutorials` directory:

    ```xml
    <div>
        Hello World!
    </div>
    ```

4.  Identify which component to add the new sub-component to.

    For this we use the [SurfBug]({% link content-services/6.2/develop/tools.md %}#surfbug) tool. Once the tool is activated (from `http://localhost:8080/share/page/surfBugStatus`) we can identify the component on the page as follows:

    ![dev-extensions-share-tutorials-add-content-page-surfbug]({% link content-services/images/dev-extensions-share-tutorials-add-content-page-surfbug.png %})

    Here we have scrolled to the bottom of the Dashboard page as we want to add our new content to the footer. Then we have clicked on the last component enclosed in red lines. This brings up the above black information box where we can see the `region-id`, `source-id`, and `scope` values that we are looking for.

5.  Add a new Surf Extension Modules file called add-page-content-extension-modules.xml to the `aio/aio-share-jar/src/main/resources/alfresco/web-extension/site-data/extensions` directory (note. it is important to give this file a unique name when several Share JARs are installed, otherwise the last one wins):

    ```xml
    <extension>
        <modules>
            <module>
                <id>Add new content to footer</id>
                <version>1.0</version>
                <auto-deploy>true</auto-deploy>
                <components>
                    <component>
                        <region-id>footer</region-id>
                        <source-id>global</source-id>
                        <scope>global</scope>
                        <sub-components>
                            <sub-component id="New_Content" index="25">
                                <url>/tutorials/new-content</url>
                            </sub-component>
                        </sub-components>
                    </component>
                </components>
            </module>
        </modules>
    </extension>
    ```

    What we are doing here is adding a new sub-component to the existing component identified by the region-id `footer` and the source-id `global`.

    The sub-component `url` points to the new Web Script that we just created.

    The sub-component's content can be displayed either before or after the default sub-component, which is the one with the `id` set to `default`. The position of the content is based on the `index` attribute value, which is set to 25 in our case. The `default` sub-component will have an `index` of 50 so our new sub-component will be displayed before it.

    The `id` of the new sub-component need to be unique within the main component (i.e. the footer) and the id `default` is reserved.

    This module will be deployed automatically when the application server is started as we have the `auto-deploy` property set to `true`.

6.  The implementation of this sample is now done, build and start the application server as follows:

    ```bash
    /all-in-one$ ./run.sh build_start
    ```

7.  Now, log in to Alfresco Share (`http://localhost:8080/share`) and you will see the content (Hello World!) from the new web script displayed just above the footer:

    ![dev-extensions-share-tutorials-add-content-page-result]({% link content-services/images/dev-extensions-share-tutorials-add-content-page-result.png %})

    >**Note:** A Surf Extension module like this can be deployed and undeployed during runtime. And this means that an Administrator can control when different customizations should be visible or hidden. This is managed via the Module deployment page that can be found at: `http://localhost:8080/share/service/modules/deploy`.

## Removing content from a Surf page {#removecontent}

**Extension Point**: [Surf Extension Modules]({% link content-services/6.2/develop/share-ext-points/surf-extension-modules.md %})

**Description**:

This tutorial demonstrates how to prevent content from being rendered in a Surf page. This tutorial also shows how to 
use evaluations to decide whether content should be rendered or not.

**Implementation Steps**:

A simple and effective way to remove content from a Surf page is to follow these steps:

1. Locate the component that corresponds to the content you want to remove from the page.
2. Make a note of the region-id, source-id, and scope information for the component.
3. Override the component definition and add an evaluator that resolves to not rendering the component.
4. Use a Surf Extension module to deploy the overridden component definition.

**Related Information**:

This tutorial assumes that you are familiar with the Spring Surf development framework. If you are new to it then read 
up on it [here]({% link content-services/6.2/develop/software-architecture.md %}#surf-framework) before starting this tutorial. 
If you have not already done so you should also review the [Introducing SurfBug]({% link content-services/6.2/develop/tools.md %}#surfbug) 
topic as this tool is used in this tutorial.

**Source Code**: [Go to code](https://github.com/Alfresco/alfresco-sdk-samples/tree/alfresco-51/all-in-one/remove-page-content-share){:target="_blank"}

This tutorial assumes you have created a new [SDK All-In-One]({% link content-services/6.2/develop/sdk.md %}#workingaio) project.

Tutorial implementation steps:

1.  Identify which component that corresponds to the content that should be removed.

    For this we use the [SurfBug]({% link content-services/6.2/develop/tools.md %}#surfbug) tool. Once the tool is activated (from `http://localhost:8080/share/page/surfBugStatus`) we can identify the component on the page as follows:

    ![dev-extensions-share-tutorials-remove-content-page-surfbug]({% link content-services/images/dev-extensions-share-tutorials-remove-content-page-surfbug.png %})

    In this case we have clicked on the "My Sites" dashlet, which brings up the above black information box where we can see the `region-id`, `source-id`, and `scope` values that we need to be able to hide the dashlet.

2.  Add a new Surf Extension Modules file called `remove-page-content-extension-modules.xml` to the `aio/aio-share-jar/src/main/resources/alfresco/web-extension/site-data/extensions` directory (note. it is important to give this file a unique name when several Share JARs are installed, otherwise the last one wins):

    ```xml
    <extension>
        <modules>
            <module>
                <id>Remove content from Share (hide My Sites)</id>
                <version>1.0</version>
                <auto-deploy>true</auto-deploy>
                <components>
                    <component>
                        <region-id>component-1-1</region-id>
                        <source-id>user/{userid}/dashboard</source-id>
                        <scope>page</scope>
                        <sub-components>
                            <sub-component id="default">
                                <evaluations>
                                    <evaluation id="guaranteedToHide">
                                        <render>false</render>
                                    </evaluation>
                                </evaluations>
                            </sub-component>
                        </sub-components>
                    </component>
                </components>
            </module>
        </modules>
    </extension>
    ```

    What we are doing here is overriding the `default` sub-component and putting in a new evaluation for it. The targeted component is identified with the values we got via SurfBug. So we set region-id to `component-1-1`, source-id to `user/{userid}/dashboard`, and scope to `page`. Note that we are changing the `source-id` from the specific one for Administrators (i.e. `user/admin/dashboard`) to one that is valid for all user dashboards.

    The sub-component evaluation definition is quite simple, we just give it a unique "bogus" `id` and set rendering to `false`. This evaluation definition is guaranteed to hide the component.

    This module will be deployed automatically when the application server is started as we have the `auto-deploy` property set to `true`.

3.  The implementation of this sample is now done, build and start the application server as follows:

    ```bash
    /all-in-one$ ./run.sh build_start
    ```

4.  Now, log in to Share (`http://localhost:8080/share`) and you will no longer see the "My Sites" dashlet on the Dashboard (that is, the "My Tasks" dashlet has taken its place):

    ![dev-extensions-share-tutorials-remove-content-page-result]({% link content-services/images/dev-extensions-share-tutorials-remove-content-page-result.png %})

    >**Note:** A Surf Extension module like this can be deployed and undeployed during runtime. And this means that an Administrator can control when different customizations should be visible or hidden. This is managed via the Module deployment page that can be found at: `http://localhost:8080/share/service/modules/deploy`.

5.  Further information

    Some features introduced in this tutorial are explained in more detail in the following sections:

    **Parametrized source-id mapping**: Every Share user gets their own dashboard page, which enables them to customize the layout to suit their own needs, but each user dashboard is generated from a single preset. In this tutorial you specify `user/{userid}/dashboard`. Note the use of the `userid` variable. This allows you to change the appearance of the dashboard for any user, not just the admin user.

    **Extending existing sub-components:** When the dashboard pages were first created, the concept of sub-components in Surf did not exist. Consequently, if you search through the existing dashboard configuration files you will not find sub-components specified. Surf automatically converts these “legacy” components into the new extensible components containing a single sub-component with the ID “default”.

    This allows you to add new content to these legacy components through sub-components, or customize the original content without affecting any new content. In the previous configuration XML, you can change the behavior of the components through modification of the default sub-component.

    Note that multiple modules can extend the same component, which is why the deployment order of modules is important.

    **Sub-component evaluations:** Every sub-component can optionally have zero or more evaluations. Each evaluation acts like an AND gate to a series of evaluators where an evaluation is considered successful if no evaluators fail. If an evaluation contains no evaluators, it is still considered to have evaluated successfully because nothing has failed.

    The purpose of an evaluation is to change the behavior of a sub-component in one of three ways:

    * Change the Web Script that renders the content by specifying a new URL.
    * Change the default properties (and/or provide new properties) that are passed to the Web Script.
    * Control whether or not the sub-component is actually rendered.
    
    In this example, you are simply overriding the default behavior of the sub-component to prevent it from rendering by setting the `<render>` element to have a value of `false` (this defaults to `true`) if not defined.

## Customizing (web script properties) the footer text for a Surf page

**Extension Point**: [Surf Extension Modules]({% link content-services/6.2/develop/share-ext-points/surf-extension-modules.md %})

**Description**:

This tutorial demonstrates how to customize the page footer web script i18n properties to change the existing text 
in the footer. The tutorial walks through how to find the related component and web script.

**Implementation Steps**:

It is often necessary to customize different parts of a Surf web script. This tutorial shows you how to customize the 
i18n properties files for a web script. The approach looks something like this:

1. Find the page component that corresponds to the content that should be changed.
2. Identify the web script that is used to deliver the content.
3. Identify what part of the web script need changing to achieve the customization, in this case the properties file, which contains the existing footer text for Content Services and Alfresco Community Edition.
4. Create your customized version of the `{web script id}.get_{lang}.properties` file.
5. Use a Surf Extension module to define the web script override.

**Related Information**:

This tutorial assumes that you are familiar with the Spring Surf development framework. If you are new to it then read 
up on it [here]({% link content-services/6.2/develop/software-architecture.md %}#surf-framework) before starting this tutorial. 
If you have not already done so you should also review the [Introducing SurfBug]({% link content-services/6.2/develop/tools.md %}#surfbug) 
topic as this tool is used in this tutorial.

**Source Code**: [Go to code](https://github.com/Alfresco/alfresco-sdk-samples/tree/alfresco-51/all-in-one/customize-webscript-i18n-props-share){:target="_blank"}

This tutorial assumes you have created a new [SDK All-In-One]({% link content-services/6.2/develop/sdk.md %}#workingaio) project.

Tutorial implementation steps:

1.  Identify the web script that delivers the content that should be customized.

    For this we use the [SurfBug]({% link content-services/6.2/develop/tools.md %}#surfbug) tool. Once the tool is activated (from `http://localhost:8080/share/page/surfBugStatus`) we can identify the web script as follows:

    ![dev-extensions-share-tutorials-i18n-customize-page-surfbug]({% link content-services/images/dev-extensions-share-tutorials-i18n-customize-page-surfbug.png %})

    Here we have scrolled to the bottom of the Dashboard page where the footer is located. Then we have clicked on the last component enclosed in red lines and representing the footer. This brings up the above black box that contains information about what web script that is delivering the content for the footer component (and then also the properties). In this case it is the `footer.get.*` web script in package `org.alfresco.components.footer` that we need to target. You can also identify the web script via the URL (that is, `/components/footer`).

2.  In the Share JAR project create a new web script override package `org.alfresco.tutorials.customization.footer.i18n`.

    The directory path that needs to be created is: `aio/aio-share-jar/src/main/resources/alfresco/web-extension/site-webscripts/org/alfresco/tutorials/customization/footer/i18n`.

    We can choose any package path we want and then specify it in the Surf Extension Module, we will see this in a bit. However, it is important that we use a package path that will not clash with another Extension Module, deployed by some other JAR.

    For example, if we just used `org.alfresco.tutorials.customization.footer` and then another JAR was deployed with some other customization to the footer, using the same package path. Then if one extension module is undeployed its customizations will still be picked up if the other module is active. This is because both modules are using the same package path.

3.  Add our version of the web script properties file for English called `footer.get_en.properties` to the `/tutorials/customization/footer/i18n` directory:

    ```text
    label.copyright=This is free software. Copyright Alfresco forever
    label.copyright.enterprise=This is the software you pay for. Copyright Alfresco forever
    ```

    To know what the property names are we first lookup the original properties file, which is located in the `tomcat/webapps/share/WEB-INF/classes/alfresco/site-webscripts/org/alfresco/components/footer` directory.

4.  Add a new Surf Extension Modules file called `customize-webscript-i18n-props-extension-modules.xml` to the `aio/aio-share-jar/src/main/resources/alfresco/web-extension/site-data/extensions` directory (note. it is important to give this file a unique name when several Share JARs are installed, otherwise the last one wins):

    ```xml
    <extension>
        <modules>
            <module>
                <id>Customize i18n labels for Footer</id>
                <version>1.0</version>
                <auto-deploy>true</auto-deploy>
                <customizations>
                    <customization>
                        <targetPackageRoot>org.alfresco.components.footer</targetPackageRoot>
                        <sourcePackageRoot>org.alfresco.tutorials.customization.footer.i18n</sourcePackageRoot>
                    </customization>
                </customizations>
            </module>
        </modules>
    </extension>
    ```

    This extension module identifies the package with the web script that we want to override by setting the `targetPackageRoot` property. When we have set what web script to override we use the `sourcePackageRoot` property to tell Content Services where to pick up the customized web script files.

    This module will be deployed automatically when the application server is started as we have the `auto-deploy` property set to `true`.

5.  The implementation of this sample is now done, build and start the application server as follows:

    ```bash
    /all-in-one$ ./run.sh build_start
    ```

6.  Now, log in to Share (`http://localhost:8080/share`) and you will see the new footer text displayed as follows:

    ![dev-extensions-share-tutorials-i18n-customize-page-result]({% link content-services/images/dev-extensions-share-tutorials-i18n-customize-page-result.png %})

    >**Note:** A Surf Extension module like this can be deployed and undeployed during runtime. And this means that an Administrator can control when different customizations should be visible or hidden. This is managed via the Module deployment page that can be found at: `http://localhost:8080/share/service/modules/deploy`.


## Customizing (web script controller) the WebView dashlet on the Dashboard page {#customizewscontroller}

**Extension Point**: [Surf Extension Modules]({% link content-services/6.2/develop/share-ext-points/surf-extension-modules.md %})

**Description**:

This tutorial demonstrates how to customize the WebView dashlet web script controller so the Alfresco Home page is 
displayed by default. The tutorial walks through how to find the related component and web script.

**Implementation Steps**:

It is often necessary to customize different parts of a Surf web script. This tutorial shows you how to customize the 
controller for a web script. The approach looks something like this:

1. Find the page component that corresponds to the content that should be changed.
2. Identify the web script that is used to deliver the content.
3. Identify what part of the web script need changing to achieve the customization, in this case the controller as we can set the page that should be loaded by default in the model.
4. Create your version of the `{web script id}.get.js` file.
5. Use a Surf Extension module to define the web script override.

**Related Information**:

This tutorial assumes that you are familiar with the Spring Surf development framework. If you are new to it then read 
up on it [here]({% link content-services/6.2/develop/software-architecture.md %}#surf-framework) before starting this tutorial. 
If you have not already done so you should also review the [Introducing SurfBug]({% link content-services/6.2/develop/tools.md %}#surfbug)

**Source Code**: [Go to code](https://github.com/Alfresco/alfresco-sdk-samples/tree/alfresco-51/all-in-one/customize-webscript-controller-share){:target="_blank"}

This tutorial assumes you have created a new [SDK All-In-One]({% link content-services/6.2/develop/sdk.md %}#workingaio) project.

Tutorial implementation steps:

1.  Add the WebView dashlet to the default dashboard for users.

    The WebView dashlet is not part of the default dashboard for users so we need to add it in order to be able to work with it when implementing this customization.

    The easiest way to add a dashlet permanently to the user dashboard is to define a new preset for the dashboard layout with id `user-dashboard`. Create a new presets directory under the `aio/aio-share-jar/src/main/resources/alfresco/web-extension/site-data` directory.

    Now, add a file called `presets.xml` to the new presets directory:

    ```xml
    <?xml version='1.0' encoding='UTF-8'?>
    <presets>
        <!-- Override wll known preset used to generate the default User dashboard.
             Add the Web View Dashlet so we can check if customization works. -->
        <preset id="user-dashboard">
            <components>
                <!-- title
                <component>
                    <scope>page</scope>
                    <region-id>title</region-id>
                    <source-id>user/${userid}/dashboard</source-id>
                    <url>/components/title/user-dashboard-title</url>
                </component>
                -->
                <!-- dashboard components -->
                <component>
                    <scope>page</scope>
                    <region-id>full-width-dashlet</region-id>
                    <source-id>user/${userid}/dashboard</source-id>
                    <url>/components/dashlets/dynamic-welcome</url>
                    <properties>
                        <dashboardType>user</dashboardType>
                    </properties>
                </component>
                <component>
                    <scope>page</scope>
                    <region-id>component-1-1</region-id>
                    <source-id>user/${userid}/dashboard</source-id>
                    <url>/components/dashlets/my-sites</url>
                </component>
                <component>
                    <scope>page</scope>
                    <region-id>component-1-2</region-id>
                    <source-id>user/${userid}/dashboard</source-id>
                    <url>/components/dashlets/my-tasks</url>
                </component>
                <component>
                    <scope>page</scope>
                    <region-id>component-2-1</region-id>
                    <source-id>user/${userid}/dashboard</source-id>
                    <url>/components/dashlets/my-activities</url>
                </component>

                    <source-id>user/${userid}/dashboard</source-id>
                    <url>/components/dashlets/webview</url>
                </component>

                    <template-instance>dashboard-2-columns-wide-right</template-instance>
                    <authentication>user</authentication>
                </page>
            </pages>
        </preset>
    </presets>
    ```

    Here we have included the WebView dashlet as `component-2-2`, so it will be displayed in column 2 and row 2 in the Dashboard layout. If you do not know the `url` for the dashlet, then just add it manually to the Dashboard and use SurfBug to identify what `url` that is used.

2.  Identify the web script that delivers the content that should be customized.

    For this we use the [SurfBug]({% link content-services/6.2/develop/tools.md %}#surfbug) tool. Once the tool is activated (from `http://localhost:8080/share/page/surfBugStatus`) we can identify the web script as follows:

    ![dev-extensions-share-tutorials-controller-customize-page-surfbug]({% link content-services/images/dev-extensions-share-tutorials-controller-customize-page-surfbug.png %})

    Here we have scrolled down a bit on the Dashboard page so we have the WebView dashlet in front of us. Then we have clicked on the WebView dashlet. This brings up the above black box that contains information about what web script that is delivering the content for the dashlet. In this case it is the `webview.get.*` web script in package `org.alfresco.components.dashlets` that we need to target. You can also identify the web script via the URL (that is, `/components/dashlets/webview`).

3.  In the Share JAR project create a new web script override package `org.alfresco.tutorials.customization.webview.controller`.

    The directory path that needs to be created is: `aio/aio-share-jar/src/main/resources/alfresco/web-extension/site-webscripts/org/alfresco/tutorials/customization/webview/controller`.

    We can choose any package path we want and then specify it in the Surf Extension Module, we will see this in a bit. However, it is important that we use a package path that will not clash with another Extension Module, deployed by some other JAR.

    For example, if we just used `org.alfresco.tutorials.customization.webview` and then another JAR was deployed with some other customization to the WebView dashlet, using the same package path. Then if one extension module is undeployed its customizations will still be picked up if the other module is active. This is because both modules are using the same package path.

4.  Add our version of the web script controller file called `webview.get.js` to the `/tutorials/customization/webview/controller` directory:

    ```javascript
    if (model.isDefault == true)
    {
        model.widgets[0].options.webviewTitle = "Alfresco!";
        model.widgets[0].options.webviewURI = "http://www.alfresco.com";
        model.widgets[0].options.isDefault = false;
    }
    ```

    This controller will be processed after the out-of-the-box WebView controller. So what we are doing is just adding some stuff to the `model` widgets to tell the dashlet to load the Alfresco home page by default.

    By inspecting the source of both the out-of-the-box controller and the template, you can work out what `model` properties the template is using (see `tomcat/webapps/share/WEB-INF/classes/alfresco/site-webscripts/org/alfresco/components/dashlets`). This allows you to determine whether or not you can update the `model` after the base controller but before the template to create the required result.

5.  Add a new Surf Extension Modules file called `customize-webscript-controller-extension-modules.xml` to the `aio/aio-share-jar/src/main/resources/alfresco/web-extension/site-data/extensions` directory (note. it is important to give this file a unique name when several Share JARs are installed, otherwise the last one wins):

    ```xml
    <extension>
        <modules>
            <module>
                <id>Customize Web Script Controller for Web View Dashlet</id>
                <version>1.0</version>
                <auto-deploy>true</auto-deploy>
                <customizations>
                    <customization>
                        <targetPackageRoot>org.alfresco.components.dashlets</targetPackageRoot>
                        <sourcePackageRoot>org.alfresco.tutorials.customization.webview.controller</sourcePackageRoot>
                    </customization>
                </customizations>
            </module>
        </modules>
    </extension>
    ```

    This extension module identifies the package with the web script that we want to override by setting the `targetPackageRoot` property. When we have set what web script to override we use the `sourcePackageRoot` property to tell Alfresco where to pick up the customized web script files.

    This module will be deployed automatically when the application server is started as we have the `auto-deploy` property set to `true`.

6.  The implementation of this sample is now done, build and start the application server as follows:

    ```bash
    /all-in-one$ ./run.sh build_start
    ```

    >**Note:**. when defining presets for sites and users know that they are stored in the database after first time usage. In this tutorial we defined a new user preset to display a slightly different user dashboard. If a user, such as **admin** that we most likely use with the SDK, has been logging in before this customization was applied, then that user will already have a user dashboard preset in the database. So the customization will not appear to work. But wipe out `alf_data_dev`, if you can, and restart and you will see that it works.

7.  Now, log in to Share (`http://localhost:8080/share`) and you will see the WebView dashlet loaded with the home page:

    ![dev-extensions-share-tutorials-controller-customize-page-result]({% link content-services/images/dev-extensions-share-tutorials-controller-customize-page-result.png %})

    >**Note:** A Surf Extension module like this can be deployed and undeployed during runtime. And this means that an Administrator can control when different customizations should be visible or hidden. This is managed via the Module deployment page that can be found at: `http://localhost:8080/share/service/modules/deploy`.

The custom JavaScript is executed after the original. The original JavaScript sets up an initial `model` object, which the default FreeMarker template can use to render content. Controller extensions then have the opportunity to change that model and thus change the rendered output. Using this approach is dependent upon the template making use of the changed model content - just adding content to the model will have no effect unless the template is also updated to make use of the additional model data.

It is not always possible to use this approach to customize existing components, as it depends on how the JavaScript controller and template are implemented, but the approach is worth exploring.

## Customizing (web script template) the footer text for a Surf page

**Extension Point**: [Surf Extension Modules]({% link content-services/6.2/develop/share-ext-points/surf-extension-modules.md %})

**Description**:

This tutorial demonstrates how to customize the page footer web script template to add some extra text to the footer. 
The tutorial walks through how to find the related component and web script.

**Implementation Steps**:

It is often necessary to customize different parts of a Surf web script. This tutorial shows you how to customize the 
template for a web script. The approach looks something like this:

1. Find the page component that corresponds to the content that should be changed.
2. Identify the web script that is used to deliver the content.
3. Identify what part of the web script need changing to achieve the customization, in this case the template.
4. Create your customized version of the `{web script id}.get.[html|json|..].ftl` file.
5. Use a Surf Extension module to define the web script override.

**Related Information**:

This tutorial assumes that you are familiar with the Spring Surf development framework. If you are new to it then read 
up on it [here]({% link content-services/6.2/develop/software-architecture.md %}#surf-framework) before starting this tutorial. 
If you have not already done so you should also review the [Introducing SurfBug]({% link content-services/6.2/develop/tools.md %}#surfbug) 
topic as this tool is used in this tutorial.

**Source Code**: [Go to code](https://github.com/Alfresco/alfresco-sdk-samples/tree/alfresco-51/all-in-one/customize-webscript-template-share){:target="_blank"}

This tutorial assumes you have created a new [SDK All-In-One]({% link content-services/6.2/develop/sdk.md %}#workingaio) project.

Tutorial implementation steps:

1.  Identify the web script that delivers the content that should be customized.

    For this we use the [SurfBug]({% link content-services/6.2/develop/tools.md %}#surfbug) tool. Once the tool is activated (from `http://localhost:8080/share/page/surfBugStatus`) we can identify the web script as follows:

    ![dev-extensions-share-tutorials-i18n-customize-page-surfbug]({% link content-services/images/dev-extensions-share-tutorials-i18n-customize-page-surfbug.png %})

    Here we have scrolled to the bottom of the Dashboard page where the footer is located. Then we have clicked on the last component enclosed in red lines and representing the footer. This brings up the above black box that contains information about what web script that is delivering the content for the footer component (and then also the controller). In this case it is the `footer.get.*` web script in package `org.alfresco.components.footer` that we need to target. You can also identify the web script via the URL (that is, `/components/footer`).

2.  In the Share JAR project create a new web script override package `org.alfresco.tutorials.customization.footer.template`.

    The directory path that needs to be created is: `aio/aio-share-jar/src/main/resources/alfresco/web-extension/site-webscripts/org/alfresco/tutorials/customization/footer/template`.

    We can choose any package path we want and then specify it in the Surf Extension Module, we will see this in a bit. However, it is important that we use a package path that will not clash with another Extension Module, deployed by some other JAR.

    For example, if we just used `org.alfresco.tutorials.customization.footer` and then another JAR was deployed with some other customization to the footer, using the same package path. Then if one extension module is undeployed its customizations will still be picked up if the other module is active. This is because both modules are using the same package path.

3.  Add our customization of the web script template file in a file named `footer.get.html.ftl` located in the `/tutorials/customization/footer/template` directory:

    ```xml
    <@markup id="additional-footer" target="html" action="before" scope="global">
        <div id="additional-footer">
            Additional Footer!
        </div>
    </@markup>
    ```

    This template will be processed after the out-of-the-box footer template. What we are doing here is just telling the template engine that we want to insert some extra footer content before the out-of-the-box footer content. The location of the new footer content is determined by the `action` attribute, which we set to `before` to get our additional footer text displayed above the original footer text. Specifically it is displayed above the markup section tagged with the `html` id, which we specify with the `target` attribute.

    You can find out the available markup sections by looking in the original template file, which in this case is `tomcat/webapps/share/WEB-INF/classes/alfresco/site-webscripts/org/alfresco/components/footer/footer.get.html.ftl`:

    ```xml
    <@markup id="css" >
       <#-- CSS Dependencies -->
       <@link href="${url.context}/res/modules/about-share.css" group="footer"/>
       <@link href="${url.context}/res/components/footer/footer.css" group="footer"/>
    </@>
    
    <@markup id="js">
       <@script src="${url.context}/res/modules/about-share.js" group="footer"/>
    </@>
    
    <@markup id="widgets">
       <@createWidgets/>
    </@>
    
    <@markup id="html">
       <@uniqueIdDiv>
          <#assign fc=config.scoped["Edition"]["footer"]>
          <div class="footer ${fc.getChildValue("css-class")!"footer-com"}">
             <span class="copyright">
                <a href="#" onclick="Alfresco.module.getAboutShareInstance().show(); return false;"><img src="${url.context}/res/components/images/${fc.getChildValue("logo")!"alfresco-share-logo.png"}" alt="${fc.getChildValue("alt-text")!"Alfresco Community"}" border="0"/></a>
                <#if licenseHolder != "" && licenseHolder != "UNKNOWN">
                   <span class="licenseHolder">${msg("label.licensedTo")} ${licenseHolder}</span><br>
                </#if>
                <span>${msg(fc.getChildValue("label")!"label.copyright")}</span>
             </span>
          </div>
       </@>
    </@>
    ```

    In most cases there is only one markup section for additional HTML and it is called `html`. You can also see markup sections for `css`, `js`, and `widgets`, which can be used to inject for example additional JavaScript and Stylesheet files.

4.  Add a new Surf Extension Modules file called `customize-webscript-template-extension-modules.xml` to the `aio/aio-share-jar/src/main/resources/alfresco/web-extension/site-data/extensions` directory (note. it is important to give this file a unique name when several Share JARs are installed, otherwise the last one wins):

    ```xml
    <extension>
        <modules>
            <module>
                <id>Customize Web Script Template for Footer</id>
                <version>1.0</version>
                <auto-deploy>true</auto-deploy>
                <customizations>
                    <customization>
                        <targetPackageRoot>org.alfresco.components.footer</targetPackageRoot>
                        <sourcePackageRoot>org.alfresco.tutorials.customization.footer.template</sourcePackageRoot>
                    </customization>
                </customizations>
            </module>
        </modules>
    </extension>
    ```

    This extension module identifies the package with the web script that we want to override by setting the `targetPackageRoot` property. When we have set what web script to override we use the `sourcePackageRoot` property to tell Alfresco where to pick up the customized web script files.

    This module will be deployed automatically when the application server is started as we have the `auto-deploy` property set to `true`.

5.  The implementation of this sample is now done, build and start the application server as follows:

    ```bash
    /all-in-one$ ./run.sh build_start
    ```

6.  Now, log in to Share (http://localhost:8080/share) and you will see the additional footer texts at the bottom of the Dashboard page:

    ![dev-extensions-share-tutorials-template-customize-page-result]({% link content-services/images/dev-extensions-share-tutorials-template-customize-page-result.png %})

    >**Note:** A Surf Extension module like this can be deployed and undeployed during runtime. And this means that an Administrator can control when different customizations should be visible or hidden. This is managed via the Module deployment page that can be found at: `http://localhost:8080/share/service/modules/deploy`.

7.  If you want to test out the other FreeMarker extensibility operations, then you can update the `footer.get.html.ftl` file as follows:

    * To place the new footer content *after* the footer:`<@region id="additional-content" target="html" action="after" scope="global"/>`
    * To *replace* the content of the footer with the new content:`<@region id= "additional-content" target="html" action="replace" scope="global"/>`
    * To *remove* the footer region completely:`<@region id="additional-content" target="html" action="remove"/>`

## Adding a new Surf page to Share 

This tutorial demonstrates how to add a new page to Alfresco Share.

In this tutorial you will see how to add a new page to Share. In the following tutorial you will see how to make this 
new page the default landing page. Source code for sample Surf page can be found 
[here](https://github.com/Alfresco/alfresco-sdk-samples/tree/alfresco-51/all-in-one/add-surf-dashlet-and-page-share){:target="_blank"} .

Adding a new page requires a minimum of three files:

* A Page definition file
* A Template-Instance definition file
* A FreeMarker template file

1.  This tutorial assumes you have created a new [SDK All-In-One]({% link content-services/6.2/develop/sdk.md %}#workingaio) project.

2.  Create a new folder called `pages` in `aio/aio-share-jar/src/main/resources/alfresco/web-extension/site-data`.

3.  In the pages folder create a new file called `home-page.xml` with the following contents:

    ```xml
    <page>
        <template-instance>home-page</template-instance>
        <authentication>user</authentication>
    </page>                        
    ```

    This is the page definition file. This defines the page name (which is the file name) and a mapping to a Template-Instance that contains the content. It also defines the level of authentication required to view the page.

4.  In the `aio/aio-share-jar/src/main/resources/alfresco/web-extension/site-data` folder, create a subfolder called `template-instances`.

5.  In the newly created `template-instances` folder, create a new file, also called `home-page.xml` with the following contents:

    ```xml
    <template-instance>
        <template-type>tutorials/home-page</template-type>
    </template-instance>
    ```

    This is the Template-Instance definition. This creates a mapping to the actual FreeMarker template that contains the content for the page.

6.  Create a new file in `aio/aio-share-jar/src/main/resources/alfresco/web-extension/templates/tutorials` called `home-page.ftl` with the following contents:

    ```xml
    <html>
        <head>
            <title>Tutorials Application</title>
        </head>
        <body>
            Welcome To Extreme Share Customization!
        </body>
    </html>                    
    ```

    This is the FreeMarker template file. This contains the actual page content. The example shown here is trivial but this could also contain regions for binding Surf components if required.

7.  The implementation of this sample is now done, build and start the application server as follows:

    ```bash
    /all-in-one$ ./run.sh build_start
    ```

8.  In your web browser open the following location `http://localhost:8080/share/page/home-page`.

    You will be prompted with the standard Share login screen.

    You are asked to log in because in the page definition file you set the authentication level to be `user`, that is the page is accessible to all logged in users. To create a page that can only be accessed by administrators using an authentication level of `admin`. To create a page that can be accessed by any user, including those who are not logged in, set the authentication level to `none`.

9.  Log in using your credentials.

    After logging in your new home page will be displayed.

    Note that the FreeMarker template for the new page can contain any HTML/JavaScript/CSS code necessary. You are not restricted to using YUI2 code as is used in the implementation of Share. It is possible to implement the new page in JQuery, Dojo, pure HTML, or any other valid code.

    As well as being able to re-use the standard Share authentication mechanism you are also able to access all the web scripts available on both the Web and Repository tiers. This means you can build your own UI around existing Content Services functionality.

    >**Note:** When using resources such as images, JavaScript and CSS files, it is important to remember that they should be located under the META-INF folder in your JAR file. Also, it is necessary to use the `/res` prefix on subsequent requests to the resources. For example, to request the file META-INF/tutorials/example.css, the URL /share/res/tutorials/example.css would be used.

## Override Share sign in page

This tutorial demonstrates how to override the default Alfresco Share sign in page.

Surf applications can define a sign in page by configuring the `login` page-type mapping to reference a specific Page 
object. In Share this definition can be found in the `surf.xml` configuration file which sets the `login` page-type to 
map to the `slingshot-login` page.

1.  This tutorial assumes you have created a new [SDK All-In-One]({% link content-services/6.2/develop/sdk.md %}#workingaio) project.

2.  In the `aio/aio-share-jar/src/main/resources/META-INF/share-config-custom.xml` file, add the following contents:

    ```xml
       <config evaluator="string-compare" condition="WebFramework">
          <web-framework>
             <defaults>
                <page-type>
                   <id>login</id>
                   <page-instance-id>tutorials-login</page-instance-id>
                </page-type>
             </defaults>
          </web-framework>
       </config>
    ```

3.  In the folder `aio/aio-share-jar/src/main/resources/alfresco/web-extension/site-data/pages`, create the referenced page as `tutorials-login.xml` with the following contents:

    ```xml
    <page>
       <template-instance>tutorials-login</template-instance>
       <authentication>none</authentication>
    </page>
    ```

    >**Note:** The page definition sets the authentication level to `none`. This is necessary otherwise the user would be required to be authenticated, that is logged in, before the login page is displayed.

4.  In the folder `aio/aio-share-jar/src/main/resources/alfresco/web-extension/site-data/template-instances` create another file also called `tutorials-login.xml` with the following content:

    ```xml
    <template-instance>
       <template-type>tutorials/tutorials-login</template-type>
    </template-instance>                 
    ```

    This file creates the mapping between the Template-Instance object and the FreeMarker template that will actually render your new sign in page.

5.  In the `aio/aio-share-jar/src/main/resources/alfresco/web-extension/templates/tutorials` folder, create the new sign in page in the file `tutorials-login.ftl`, with the following content:

    ```xml
    <html>
       <head>
          <title>Tutorials Login</title>
       </head>
       <body>
          <h2>Tutorials Login</h2>  
          <form id="loginform" accept-charset="UTF-8" method="post" action="${url.context}/page/dologin">
             Username: <input type="text" id="username" name="username"/><br>
             Password: <input type="password" id="password" name="password"/><br>
             <input type="submit" id="btn-login" />
          </form>
       </body>
    </html>                        
    ```

6.  The implementation of this sample is now done, build and start the application server as follows:

    ```bash
    /all-in-one$ ./run.sh build_start
    ```

7.  View the page `http://localhost:8080/share`.

    >**Note:** You might find that you are logged in automatically without being prompted for user name and password. This is because your validation might be cached in cookies. To resolve this simply remove cookies for your localhost and attempt to access `http://localhost:8080/share` again. This time you will see your custom login page.

    The new sign in page will be displayed.

## Making the new page the default

This tutorial demonstrates how to make the new page you created in the previous tutorial the default landing page.

In this tutorial you will see how to make a page the default landing page.

Surf supports the notion of a default page which is defined in the configuration for the entire website. By default the 
landing page is `site-index.jsp`, which redirects to the authenticated user's dashboard page. The site default landing 
page will be rendered when a request is mapped to the Spring MVC `RequestDispatcher` (which by default is at `/page` and `/p`) 
but no page is included in the request, for example, `/share/page`. This is also configured as the welcome-file in 
the Share `web.xml` file.

To change the landing page for the application, you can override the default site configuration for Alfresco Share. 
The site configuration used is defined in `surf.xml` and is set to `slingshot.site.configuration` by default.

1.  This tutorial assumes you have created a new [SDK All-In-One]({% link content-services/6.2/develop/sdk.md %}#workingaio) project.

2.  Create a folder called `configurations` in `aio/aio-share-jar/src/main/resources/alfresco/web-extension/site-data`

3.  In the configurations folder create a file called `slingshot.site.configuration.xml`, with the following contents:

    ```xml
    <configuration>
        <source-id>site</source-id>
        <properties>
            <root-page>home-page</root-page>
        </properties>
    </configuration>
    ```

    >**Important:** Note that the file is located on the web-extension path so that it is resolved before the Share default.

4.  The implementation of this sample is now done, build and start the application server as follows:

    ```bash
    /all-in-one$ ./run.sh build_start
    ```

5.  Load the page `http://localhost:8080/share`.

    After logging in your new landing page will be displayed.

## Localizing Pages

Use this information to localize pages.

### Introduction

You can provide i18n properties files with the same prefix that can then be accessed in the JavaScript controller by calling:

```javascript
msg.get("<key>")
```

It is also possible to achieve this by calling from the FreeMarker template:

```javascript
${msg(“<key>”)}
```

Traditionally, Share would pass all of the messages from a web script into the widgets that it instantiated by calling 
its `.setMessages()` function.

There are global properties files that can be used throughout Share. These are `common.properties` and `slingshot.properties` 
that can be found in `/share/WEB-INF/classes/alfresco/messages`.

The contents of all of these files will be active on the page by using the JavaScript global variable `Alfresco.messages`. 
This is a map with the attributes, `global` and `scope`:

* `global` contains all the messages from the global properties files
* `scope` is a map of widget name to messages map

The `.setMessages()` function of Share widgets adds its own name as a key into the scope map and assigns all the 
supplied messages as an object against that key. For example, if the `Alfresco.DocumentList` widget is instantiated 
then `Alfresco.messages.scope['Alfresco.DocumentList']` can be used to access its messages.

### Changes for the updated UI framework

The updated development approach in 4.2 and above is consistent with the pattern found in previous versions of 
Content Services, and have intentionally not followed the standard Dojo pattern. The latest approach uses the 
same `Alfresco.messages` object (although this can be reconfigured if you want to use a different root variable) and 
still sets the `global` and `scope` attributes.

If you create a widget with an `i18nScope` attribute then this is the scope into which the widget's encapsulated 
messages will be added. If no `i18nScope` attribute is defined then the messages will go into a scope called `default` 
(unless the widget extends another widget in which case it will inherit the parent's `i18nScope` attribute).

The i18n properties from the web script that processes the JSON model will automatically be placed into a new attribute 
of `Alfresco.messages` called `page`.

Whenever the `.message()` function is called from `Alfresco/core/Core` all applicable scopes are searched and the most 
specific result will be applied. These scopes are listed here:

* Global
* Page
* Default scope
* All inherited scopes
* Widget scopes

When creating a custom widget there is a distinction to be drawn between:

* Labels that never change
* Variable labels that can be selected from
* Custom labels

For example, the label for a menu item cannot realistically be included as part of the widget, but an error message 
could be. When accepting configurable labels they should be passed through the `.message()` function in case a message 
key (rather than a localized message) has been provided, as if no match is found then the value supplied to the method 
is returned.

This means that when constructing the JSON model for a page you could provide:

```json
config: {
   label: "message.key"
}
```

or

```json
config: {
   label: msg.get("message.key")
}
```

At first glance these might appear identical, but if the widget defines a message with the key `message.key` then this 
will override any message that the web script might be able to resolve.

### Language Variations

As the widgets process locale-specific properties files in exactly the same way as web scripts, it is possible to 
reference a web script's properties file in the `i18nRequirements` attribute of a widget.

### Summary

You have learned how i18n properties are handled in the updated UI framework approach to page and widget construction. 
It follows the Content Services approach rather than having adopted the standard Dojo approach. This has been 
done to achieve consistency with previous versions of Content Services.
