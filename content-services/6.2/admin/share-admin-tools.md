title: Share Admin Tools
---

Share Admin Tools help you to manage your administration operations.

Administrators can use the Share Admin Tools to create and manage users and groups directly in Share, set application preferences, manage categories and tags, and browse the system information in the node browser.

>**Note:** You can find additional admin tools in the [Repository Admin Console]({% link content-services/6.2/admin/admin-console.md %}).

**Admin Tools** is visible on the toolbar if you're an Administrator or a user who is a member of the `ALFRESCO_ADMINISTRATORS` or `ALFRESCO_MODEL_ADMINISTRATORS` groups. If you're a member of `SITES_ADMINISTRATORS`, you'll have an additional **Sites Manager** option on the toolbar instead of **Admin Tools**.

## Overview

You can see the **Admin Tools** option on the menu bar if you're an administrator user or a user who is a member of the `ALFRESCO_ADMINISTRATORS` group. Use the links to see more information about each tool.

1. Click **Admin Tools**.

    The tools are listed on the left-side of the page. The first set of tools are for general Content Services administration:

    * Application: [Share theme and logo](#theme-logo)
    * Category Manager: [Managing categories](#cat-manager)
    * Module Browser: [Viewing module packages]({% link content-services/6.2/install/zip/amp.md %}#viewing-module-packages)
    * Node Browser: [Using the Node Browser in Share Admin Tools]({% link content-services/6.2/admin/troubleshoot.md %}#using-the-node-browser)
    * Search Manager: [Manage search filters](#search-manager)
    * Tag Manager: [Managing tags](#tag-manager)
    * Model Manager: [Content modeling with Model Manager]({% link content-services/6.2/config/models.md %})
    * Sites Manager: [Sites Manager](#sites-manager)

    The remaining tools are grouped into the following categories:

    * Repository:
        * Replication Jobs: [Managing replication jobs]({% link content-services/6.2/admin/replication.md %})
    * Users and Groups:
        * Groups: [Managing groups]({% link content-services/6.2/admin/users-groups.md %}#manage-groups)
        * Users: [Managing users]({% link content-services/6.2/admin/users-groups.md %}#manage-users)

2. Select an Admin Tool from the left side to see the page for each tool.

3. Click the user name to see the profile of the user who last modified the tag.

## Sites Manager

The Sites Manager is used for maintaining sites. You have control over the visibility of all sites as well as deleting sites or making yourself a site manager.

> **Note:** Sites Manager is available to users in the `ALFRESCO_ADMINISTRATORS` and `SITES_ADMINISTRATORS` permissions groups. If you're in the `ALFRESCO_ADMINISTRATORS` group, you can access the Site Manager through the **Admin Tools** on the toolbar. If you're a member of `SITE_ADMINISTRATORS` group, you'll have an additional **Sites Manager** option on the toolbar.

The Sites Manager displays the names and status of created sites, regardless of their visibility setting. You can use the **Visibility** menu to change the visibility of any site, for example, change the site visibility to either **Public**, **Moderated**, or **Private**. Any visibility change you make to a site is made immediately.

With the **Actions** menu, there are two options:

* Delete Site
* Become Site Manager

You can delete any of the sites in the Site Manager list by selecting **Delete Site** from the **Actions** menu. This action deletes all site details and content.

The `I'm a Site Manager` column shows the sites where you have the Site Manager permission. If you'ren't already a manager of a site, then select **Become Site Manager** from the **Actions** menu.

## Search Manager

With the **Search Manager** you can see details of existing search filters and create new filters.

Filtered search is a powerful search feature that allows users to filter and customize their results by applying multiple filters to their search results in a navigational way. Filtered search breaks up search results into multiple categories, typically showing counts for each, and allows the user to drill down or further restrict their search results based on those filters.

You can configure filtered search either by using [configuration files](#configfilteredsearch) or by using the Search Manager.

Take a look at this video to learn more: [Search Manager]({% link content-services/6.2/tutorial/video/content.md %}#use-search-manager)

### Configure filtered search using configuration files {#configfilteredsearch}

This section shows how to configure filtered search manually with configuration files.

#### Filtered search configuration file and default properties

There are a number of default filtered search configuration properties defined. The default filtered search properties are explained here.

The following example shows how the default filters are defined:

```text
#
# Alfresco default facets
# Note: If you've changed the filter's default value(s) via Share, then any
# subsequent changes of those default values won't be applied to the filter on
# server startup.
#

# Field-Facet-Qname => cm:content.mimetype
default.cm\:content.mimetype.filterID=filter_mimetype

# Field-Facet-Qname => cm:content.size
default.cm\:content.size.filterID=filter_content_size
default.cm\:content.size.displayName=faceted-search.facet-menu.facet.size
default.cm\:content.size.displayControl=alfresco/search/FacetFilters
default.cm\:content.size.maxFilters=5

```

An example of a filter is `cm:modified`. It specifies the name of the filter field. It is the field on which you want to do a filtered search.

| Property | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| filterID | Specifies a unique name to identify the filter. Before adding a new filter, check the existing filters via Search Manager to ensure that the `filterID` does not already exist. |
| displayName | Specifies the display name of the filter. |
| displayControl | Enables the user to decide the user interface control or how the filter is displayed on the **Search** page. The default option is **Check box**. `displayControl` is the full module name for an Aikau widget which is used for rendering the facet filters. By default, Content Services provides `alfresco/search/FacetFilters` which is a basic rendering of the filters available for the facet. |
| maxFilters | Enables the user to select the maximum number of filters shown for search results. You can select to show more than one filter. |
| hitThreshold | Enables the user to select the minimum number of matches a filter result must have to be shown on the **Search** page. |
| minFilterValueLength | Specifies the minimum length of characters that a filter value must have to be displayed. This can be useful in hiding common short words. |
| sortBy | Enables the user to select the order in which the filter results must be shown on the **Search** page. The `sortBy` option is passed to the `FacetFilters` widget and defines how the filters should be sorted. This property has the following options {::nomarkdown}<ul><li>ALPHABETICALLY - Specifies the filter value A-Z.</li><li>REVERSE_ALPHABETICALLY - Specifies the filter value Z-A.</li><li>ASCENDING - Specifies the number of filter results (low to high).</li><li>DESCENDING - Specifies the number of filter results (high to low).</li><li>INDEX - This is a special value reserved for results rendered by filter queries.</li></ul>{:/} |
| scope | Enables the user to select the sites where the filter will be available. |
| scopedSites | Displays a list of sites where the filter will be available. |
| isEnabled | Specifies if the filter is enabled for inclusion on the search results page. Disabled filters are not displayed. Only the filters you create via Share console can be deleted; default filters must be disabled to hide them. |

> **Note:** You can't delete or modify any of the default filters, however you can disable them. To define your own custom filters, see next section.

#### Define custom search filters using configuration file

You can define and create your own custom filters for being displayed on the search result page.

You can define custom filters in the `solr-facets-config-custom.properties` file. You can also use this file to override the default filter properties.

1. Navigate to the `<classpathRoot\>/alfresco/extension` directory.

2. Create the `solr-facets-config-custom.properties` file.

3. Open the `solr-facets-config-custom.properties` file and specify your custom filter properties.

    Here's an example of custom filter configuration:

    ```text
    custom.cm\:description.filterID=filter_newFilter
    custom.cm\:description.displayName=faceted-search.facet-menu.facet.description
    custom.cm\:description.displayControl=alfresco/search/FacetFilters
    custom.cm\:description.maxFilters=3
    custom.cm\:description.hitThreshold=1
    custom.cm\:description.minFilterValueLength=2
    custom.cm\:description.sortBy=DESCENDING
    custom.cm\:description.scope=SCOPED_SITES
    custom.cm\:description.scopedSites=
    custom.cm\:description.isEnabled=true
    ```

    > **Note:** The values specified in the custom filters will overwrite the default filter's value. However, if you change the filter's default value(s) via Share, then any subsequent changes made to the filter values via the configuration files, won't be applied to the filter on server startup.
