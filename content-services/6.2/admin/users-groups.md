title: Manage users and groups
---

Before you can set up any security you need users and groups to work with. Use this information to administer your users and groups in Content Services.

> **Note:** The Content Services repository would normally be connected to a directory service to sync users and groups into the database, see [Setting up authentication and sync]({% link content-services/6.2/admin/auth-sync.md %})

## Manage users

The **Users** tool in the Share **Admin Tools** lets you create and manage the user accounts.

See also Users tool [video tutorial]({% link content-services/6.2/tutorial/video/index.md %}#create-users)

### Create new user

Create user accounts with the **Users** option.

1. Click **Admin Tools**, and then click **Users**.

    You'll see the **User Search** page.

2. Click **New User**.

    The **New User** page appears. Fields marked with an asterisk (*) are required.

3. Complete all the required user fields.

    | Field | Description |
    | ----- | ----------- |
    | First Name | Type the first name of the new user. |
    | Email | Type an email address that the user will use for receiving notification emails. |
    | User Name | Type a user name for the new user. |
    | Password | Type a password for the user account.<br><br>**Note:** Enter a minimum of five characters otherwise you'll not be able to see the **Create User** button. |
    | Verify Password | Repeat the password. Make sure that you type the same password you typed in the **Password** field. |

4. Add the user to existing user groups:

    1. In the search box, type the full or partial name of a group.

        You must enter a minimum of one (1) character. The search is not case sensitive.

    2. Click **Search**.

    3. In the list of returned results, click **Add** to the right of each group you want the user to be added to.

        The groups appear beneath the **Groups** list. Click a group to remove it.

    4. Perform additional searches as necessary to locate and add more groups.

5. In the **Quota** box, specify the maximum space available for this user and select the appropriate unit (GB, MB, or KB).

    This information is not required. When no quota is provided, the user has no space limitations.

    Content quotas are disabled by default. You can change the default setting by adding the following property to the `alfresco-global.properties` file: `system.usages.enabled=true`.

6. Click **Create User**.

    > **Note:** The create buttons are not available until you complete all the required fields. If you didn't type in matching passwords, you'll see a message to say that the password fields do not match.

    If you intend to immediately create another user, click **Create and Create Another**. This creates the user account specified and clears the fields without returning you to the User Search page.

### Upload multiple users

Use the Users tool to upload externally created users from within a comma-separated (CSV) file.

When initially setting up the accounts for your users, it can be time consuming to create multiple users individually. Content Services lets you create these users by uploading a file that contains the list of all your users. The file needs to contain the names and other details, separated by commas.

You can create this file, either from a text file or from a Microsoft Office spreadsheet. You need to create the file using named headings and the following order:

```text
User Name,First Name,Last Name,E-mail Address,,Password,Company,Job Title,Location,Telephone,Mobile,
Skype,IM,Google User Name,Address,Address Line 2,Address Line 3,Post Code,Telephone,Fax,Email
```

You don't need values for all the headings for each users. For example, the following sample shows the content of a CSV file using Microsoft Excel:

![sample_csv_file]({% link content-services/images/sample_csv_file.png %})

> **Note:** If the value for **Password** is blank, then the user will get a random password, and it'll be disabled. For the password to be enabled, the administrator must set a password for that user.

Save the file as a `.csv` file, which you can then upload.

![sample_csv_txt]({% link content-services/images/sample_csv_txt.png %})

1. Click **Admin Tools**, and then click **Users**.

    You'll see the **User Search** page.

2. Click **Upload User CSV File**.

3. Locate and upload the CSV file:

    1. Click the Select file(s) to upload icon.

    2. Browse for the CSV file containing the users.

        The CSV file has an extension of .csv.

    3. Select the file, and then click **Open**.

    4. Click **Upload File(s)**.

    The users from the CSV file are uploaded and you see the **Upload Results** page showing the list of user names and status. An email will be sent to the user informing them of their new user account.
