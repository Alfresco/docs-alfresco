title: Install with Ansible
---

This page describes how to install Content Services using an [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com){:target="_blank"} 
playbook. Ansible is an open-source software provisioning, configuration management and application installation tool 
enabling infrastructure as code. Alfresco provides an Ansible playbook capable of installing Content Services 
Enterprise edition version 7.x or 6.2.N.

Before continuing you need to get familiar with some [Ansible concepts](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/basic_concepts.html){:target="_blank"}:
 
* [control node](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/basic_concepts.html#control-node){:target="_blank"}: the machine the playbook is run from is known as the **control node**.   
* [connection type](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/intro_inventory.html#connecting-to-hosts-behavioral-inventory-parameters){:target="_blank"}: the type of connection to the host. This can be the name of any of Ansibleâ€™s connection plugins. SSH protocol types are `smart`, `ssh` or `paramiko`. The default is `smart`.  
* [inventory file](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/intro_inventory.html#intro-inventory){:target="_blank"}: an **inventory file** defines the hosts and groups of hosts upon which commands, modules, and tasks in a playbook operate. The inventory file can list individual hosts or user-defined groups of hosts.

There are two types of installations:
 
* **Local** where all the components will be installed on the control node machine:

![deployment-type-local]({% link content-services/images/deployment-type-local.png %})

* **Remote** (also known as `ssh`) where components can be installed on one or more remote `hosts`. These hosts can be bare metal machines, Virtual machines or instances running on a public cloud:

![deployment-type-ssh]({% link content-services/images/deployment-type-ssh.png %})

## Prerequisites
If you are using the Content Services Enterprise edition, then you need credentials to access the necessary artifacts from 
[Nexus](https://artifacts.alfresco.com){:target="_blank"}. Customers can request these through 
[Hyland Community](https://community.hyland.com/){:target="_blank"}.

## Setting up Ansible
As mentioned in the introduction, a control node is required to run the playbook. You can use any computer that has a 
Python installation as a control node. Laptops, desktops, and servers can usually all run Ansible.

In the interest of keeping this guide simple we will use an AWS EC2 instance as the control node, the steps required are 
shown below:

1. Launch an EC2 instance using the Centos 7 or 8 (x86_64) AMI from the Marketplace (instance size/type does not matter)

    ![centos-ami]({% link content-services/images/centos-ami.png %})

2. Download the Ansible playbook [zip file](https://nexus.alfresco.com/nexus/service/local/repositories/releases/content/org/alfresco/alfresco-ansible-deployment/1.0/alfresco-ansible-deployment-1.0.zip){:target="_blank"}

3. Transfer the ZIP file to the control node and SSH into the machine

    ```bash
    scp -i <yourpem-file> <local-path>/alfresco-ansible-deployment-<version>.zip centos@<control-node-ip>:/home/centos/
    ssh -i <yourpem-file> centos@<control-node-ip>
    ```

4. Install the required dependencies for Ansible (replace the 7 with 8 in the URL if you're using CentOS 8)

    ```bash
    sudo yum install -y unzip https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-7.noarch.rpm
    ```

5. Install Ansible

    ```bash
    sudo yum install -y ansible
    ```

6. Extract the ZIP file

    ```bash
    unzip alfresco-ansible-deployment-<version>.zip
    ```

7. Create environment variables to hold your Nexus credentials as shown below (replacing the values appropriately):

    ```bash
    export NEXUS_USERNAME="<your-username>"
    export NEXUS_PASSWORD="<your-password>"
    ```

Without any additional configuration applied, the playbook will install the default Content Services components. 
Please review the [configuration](#configure-your-installation) section below, to adjust some of the configurable 
installation options.

To install everything on the control node follow the steps in the [Locahost Installation](#local-installation) section. 
To install to one or more other machines follow the steps in the [Remote Installation](#remote-installation) section.

## Local Installation
The diagram below shows the result of a local installation.

![acs-localhost]({% link content-services/images/acs-localhost.png %})

To install Content Services 7 Enterprise on the local machine navigate to the folder you extracted the ZIP to and 
execute the playbook as the current user using the following command (the playbook will escalate privileges when required):

```bash
ansible-playbook playbooks/acs.yml -i inventory_local.yml
```

Alternatively, to install an earlier version of Content Services Enterprise (e.g. 6.2.2) use the following command:

```bash
ansible-playbook playbooks/acs.yml -i inventory_local.yml -e "@6.2.N-extra-vars.yml"
```

>**Note**: The playbook takes around 30 minutes to complete.

Once the playbook is complete Ansible will display a play recap to let you know that everything is done, similar to 
the following:

```bash
PLAY RECAP *******************************************************************************************************
activemq_1                 : ok=24   changed=0    unreachable=0    failed=0    skipped=17   rescued=0    ignored=0
adw_1                      : ok=24   changed=6    unreachable=0    failed=0    skipped=6    rescued=0    ignored=0
database_1                 : ok=20   changed=0    unreachable=0    failed=0    skipped=11   rescued=0    ignored=0
nginx_1                    : ok=21   changed=8    unreachable=0    failed=0    skipped=8    rescued=0    ignored=0
repository_1               : ok=92   changed=43   unreachable=0    failed=0    skipped=14   rescued=0    ignored=0
search_1                   : ok=34   changed=13   unreachable=0    failed=0    skipped=11   rescued=0    ignored=0
syncservice_1              : ok=39   changed=18   unreachable=0    failed=0    skipped=13   rescued=0    ignored=0
transformers_1             : ok=81   changed=10   unreachable=0    failed=0    skipped=44   rescued=0    ignored=0
```

Once Content Services has started up completely you can access the system using the following URLs with a browser:

* Digital Workspace: `http://<control-node-public-ip>/workspace`
* Share: `http://<control-node-public-ip>/share`
* Repository: `http://<control-node-public-ip>/alfresco`
* API Explorer: `http://<control-node-public-ip>/api-explorer`

## Remote Installation
To install to hosts other than the control node an SSH connection is required. The control node must have network access 
to all the target hosts and permission to SSH into the machine.

>**Note:** The inventory file (`inventory_ssh.yml`) is used to specify the target IP addresses and the SSH connection 
details. You can specify one IP address for all the hosts to obtain a single-machine installation, or different IP addresses 
for a multi-machine installation.

The example snippet below demonstrates how to install the repository to a host with an IP address of `50.6.51.7` using an 
SSH key located at `/path/to/ssh_key.pem`.

```yaml
repository:
  hosts:
    repository_1:
    connection: shh
    ansible_host: 50.6.51.7
    ansible_private_key_file: "/path/to/ssh_key.pem"
    ansible_user: centos
    ansible_ssh_common_args: "-o UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null -o ControlMaster=auto
      -o ControlPersist=60s -o ForwardX11=no -o LogLevel=ERROR
      -o IdentitiesOnly=yes -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no"
```

### Single Machine Installation
The diagram below shows the result of a single machine installation.

![acs-single-machine]({% link content-services/images/acs-single-machine.png %})

Once you have prepared the target host and configured the `inventory_ssh.yaml` file as described above, you are ready 
to run the playbook.

To check your inventory file is configured correctly and the control node is able to connect to the target host navigate 
to the folder where you extracted the ZIP to and run the following command:

```bash
ansible all -m ping -i inventory_ssh.yml
```

To install Content Services 7 Enterprise on the target host execute the playbook as the current user using the 
following command:

```bash
ansible-playbook playbooks/acs.yml -i inventory_ssh.yml
```

Alternatively, to install an Content Services 6.2.N Enterprise system use the following command:

```bash
ansible-playbook playbooks/acs.yml -i inventory_ssh.yml -e "@6.2.N-extra-vars.yml"
```

>**Note**: The playbook takes around 30 minutes to complete.

Once the playbook is complete Ansible will display a play recap to let you know that everything is done, similar to 
the following:

```bash  
PLAY RECAP *******************************************************************************************************
activemq_1                 : ok=24   changed=0    unreachable=0    failed=0    skipped=17   rescued=0    ignored=0
adw_1                      : ok=24   changed=6    unreachable=0    failed=0    skipped=6    rescued=0    ignored=0
database_1                 : ok=20   changed=0    unreachable=0    failed=0    skipped=11   rescued=0    ignored=0
nginx_1                    : ok=21   changed=8    unreachable=0    failed=0    skipped=8    rescued=0    ignored=0
repository_1               : ok=92   changed=43   unreachable=0    failed=0    skipped=14   rescued=0    ignored=0
search_1                   : ok=34   changed=13   unreachable=0    failed=0    skipped=11   rescued=0    ignored=0
syncservice_1              : ok=39   changed=18   unreachable=0    failed=0    skipped=13   rescued=0    ignored=0
transformers_1             : ok=81   changed=10   unreachable=0    failed=0    skipped=44   rescued=0    ignored=0
```

Once Content Services has started up completely you can access the system using the following URLs with a browser:

* Digital Workspace: `http://<target-host-ip>/workspace`
* Share: `http://<target-host-ip>/share`
* Repository: `http://<target-host-ip>/alfresco`
* API Explorer: `http://<target-host-ip>/api-explorer`

### Multi Machine Installation
The diagram below shows the result of a multi machine installation.

![acs-multi-machine]({% link content-services/images/acs-multi-machine.png %})

Once you have prepared the target hosts (ensuring the [relevant ports](#tcp-port-configuration) are accessible) and 
configured the `inventory_ssh.yaml` file as described above, you are ready to run the playbook.

>**Note.** Currently, ADW must be deployed on the same host (adw_1) as the NGinx reverse proxy (nginx_1). 
We will address this issue in a future release.

To check that your inventory file is configured correctly, and that the control node is able to connect to the target hosts, 
run the following command:

```bash
ansible all -m ping -i inventory_ssh.yml
```

To install Content Services 7 Enterprise on the target hosts execute the playbook as the current user using the 
following command:

```bash
ansible-playbook playbooks/acs.yml -i inventory_ssh.yml
```

Alternatively, to install an Content Services 6.2.N Enterprise system use the following command:

```bash
ansible-playbook playbooks/acs.yml -i inventory_ssh.yml -e "@6.2.N-extra-vars.yml"
```

>**Note.** The playbook takes around 30 minutes to complete.

Once the playbook is complete Ansible will display a play recap to let you know that everything is done, similar to the 
following:

```bash  
PLAY RECAP *******************************************************************************************************
activemq_1                 : ok=24   changed=0    unreachable=0    failed=0    skipped=17   rescued=0    ignored=0
adw_1                      : ok=24   changed=6    unreachable=0    failed=0    skipped=6    rescued=0    ignored=0
database_1                 : ok=20   changed=0    unreachable=0    failed=0    skipped=11   rescued=0    ignored=0
nginx_1                    : ok=21   changed=8    unreachable=0    failed=0    skipped=8    rescued=0    ignored=0
repository_1               : ok=92   changed=43   unreachable=0    failed=0    skipped=14   rescued=0    ignored=0
search_1                   : ok=34   changed=13   unreachable=0    failed=0    skipped=11   rescued=0    ignored=0
syncservice_1              : ok=39   changed=18   unreachable=0    failed=0    skipped=13   rescued=0    ignored=0
transformers_1             : ok=81   changed=10   unreachable=0    failed=0    skipped=44   rescued=0    ignored=0
```

Once Content Services has started up completely you can access the system using the following URLs with a browser:

* Digital Workspace: `http://<nginx-host-ip>/workspace`
* Share: `http://<nginx-host-ip>/share`
* Repository: `http://<nginx-host-ip>/alfresco`
* API Explorer: `http://<nginx-host-ip>/api-explorer`

## Useful Information
The following section contains further information about the Ansible installation approach.

### Folder Structure
Regardless of the role and connection type a consistent folder structure is used, you will find the installed files in 
the following locations:

|Path|Purpose|
|-----|------|
| `/opt/alfresco`     | Binaries |
| `/etc/opt/alfresco` | Configuration |
| `/var/opt/alfresco` | Data |
| `/var/log/alfresco` | Logs |

### Service Configuration
The following `systemd` services are installed and can be used to stop and start Alfresco components:

|Service Name|Purpose|
|------------|------|
| `activemq.service` | ActiveMQ Service |
| `postgresql-<version>.service` | Postgresql DB Service (where `<version>` is 11 for Content Services 6.2.N and 13 for Content Services 7.x) |
| `nginx.service` | Nginx Service |
| `alfresco-content.service` | Content Service |
| `alfresco-search.service` | Alfresco Search Service |
| `alfresco-shared-fs.service` | Alfresco Shared File Store Controller Service |
| `alfresco-sync.service` | Alfresco Sync Service |
| `alfresco-tengine-aio.service` | Alfresco AIO Transform Core Engine |
| `alfresco-transform-router.service` | Alfresco Transformation Router Service |

### TCP Port Configuration
Several roles setup services that listen on TCP ports and several roles wait for TCP ports to be listening before 
continuing execution (indicated by `Yes` in the "Required For Installation" column). The table below shows the 
communication paths and port numbers used.

|Target Host|Target Port|Source Hosts|Required For Installation|
|-----------|-----------|------------|-------------------------|
| activemq | 61616 | repository, syncservice, transformers | Yes |
| database | 5432 | repository, syncservice | Yes |
| repository | 8080 | nginx, search, syncservice | Yes |
| search | 8983 | repository | No |
| transformers (aio t-engine) | 8090 | repository | No |
| syncservice | 9090 | nginx | No |
| adw | 80 | nginx | No |
| nginx | 80 | `<client-ips>` | No |
| nginx | 443 | `<client-ips>` | No |

>**Note.**: The transformers host will also contain the transform router process running on port 8095 and the shared 
file system process running on 8099 but communication between these components remains local.

## Configure your installation
By default, without any configuration applied, the playbook will install a limited trial of the Enterprise version of 
Content Services 7.x that goes into read-only mode after 2 days. If you'd like to try Content Services for a longer period, 
request the 30-day [Download Trial](https://www.alfresco.com/platform/content-services-ecm/trial/download){:target="_blank"}.

The sections below describe how you can configure your installation before running the playbook.

### License
If you have a valid license place your `*.lic` file in the `configuration_files/licenses` folder before running the playbook.

>NOTE: You can also [upload a license](https://docs.alfresco.com/6.2/tasks/at-adminconsole-license.html){:target="_blank"} 
via the Admin Console once the system is running.

### Alfresco Global Properties
You can provide your [repository configuration](https://github.com/Alfresco/acs-deployment/blob/master/docs/properties-reference.md){:target="_blank"} 
by editing the `configuration_files/alfresco-global.properties` file.

The properties defined in this file will be appended to the generated `alfresco-global.properties` located in 
`/etc/opt/alfresco/content-services/classpath`.

### Override Playbook Variables
Ansible provides a mechanism to [override variables](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/playbooks_variables.html#defining-variables-at-runtime){:target="_blank"} 
provided by the playbook at runtime.

Whilst it's possible to override any variable defined by the playbook we have only tested changing the variables defined 
in `group_vars/all.yml`.

Variables can be overridden using either the `--extra-vars` or `-e` command line option when running the playbook.

If you have more than one variable to override we recommend using a separate file. The file name must be prefixed with 
`@`, for example:

```bash
ansible-playbook ... --extra-vars "@my-vars.yml"
```

### Applying your own modules (AMP or JAR)
Several Alfresco Module Packages (AMP) files are downloaded and applied during playbook execution, these are defined in 
a variable that can be overridden using the mechanism described in the previous section. Follow the steps below to apply 
your own AMPs:

1. Open `group_vars/all.yml` and copy the whole `amp_downloads` variable definition
2. Create a new file and paste the `amp_downloads` variable
3. Add any additional AMPs you want to apply paying close attention to the `dest` property. If it's a repository AMP use the `amps_repo` folder, if it's a Share AMP use the `amps_share` folder
4. Save the file and reference it via the `--extra-vars` option when running the playbook

>**Note**: This mechanism will be improved in a future release.

### JVM Options
Each Java based service installed by the playbook is configured with some default settings, including memory settings.

The defaults are defined in `group_vars/all.yml` so they can be overridden using the mechanism described 
[above](#override-playbook-variables).

For example, to override the `JAVA_OPTS` environment variable for the Transform Core AIO Engine place the following in 
your extra vars file:

```yaml
tengine_environment:
  JAVA_OPTS: "$JAVA_OPTS -Xms512m -Xmx1g"
```

The `*_environment` variable is defined as a dictionary, all keys are added to the relevant components start script 
thus allowing you to define any number of environment variables.

### External Databases
By default the playbook will install and configure a Postgres server for you. If you'd prefer to use an external database 
server you can override the `repo_db_url` variable as described [previously](#override-playbook-variables).

An example custom database url is shown below:

```yaml
repo_db_url: jdbc:mysql://54.164.117.56:3306/alfresco?useUnicode=yes&characterEncoding=UTF-8
repo_db_driver: com.mysql.jdbc.Driver
```

Along with the url the database driver binaries need to be provided for one or both services in the 
`configuration_files/db_connector_repo` and/or `configuration_files/db_connector_sync` folders.

The default database username (`repo_db_username` and/or `sync_db_username`) and password (`repo_db_password` and/or 
`sync_db_password`) in the configuration file `group_vars/all.yml` can also be overidden with your custom values.

Please refer to the [configuring databases]({% link content-services/latest/config/databases.md %}) documentation for 
more detailed information.

### Custom Keystore
By default the playbook installs a default keystore to ease the installation process, however, we recommend you 
[generate your own keystore]({% link search-services/latest/config/keys.md %}).

There are three steps required to use a custom keystore:

1. Place your generated keystore file in the `configuration_files/keystores` folder (these get copied to `/var/opt/alfresco/content-services/keystore`)
2. Override the `use_custom_keystores` variable defined in `group_vars/all.yml`
3. Override the `acs_environment` variable and define your custom `JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS` configuration

An example custom `extra-vars` file is shown below:

```yaml
use_custom_keystores: true
acs_environment:
  JAVA_OPTS: " -Xms512m -Xmx3g -XX:+DisableExplicitGC
    -XX:+UseConcMarkSweepGC
    -Djava.awt.headless=true
    -XX:ReservedCodeCacheSize=128m
    $JAVA_OPTS"
  JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS: " -Dencryption.keystore.type=pkcs12
    -Dencryption.cipherAlgorithm=AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding
    -Dencryption.keyAlgorithm=AES
    -Dencryption.keystore.location=/var/opt/alfresco/content-services/keystore/<your-keystore-file>
    -Dmetadata-keystore.password=<your-keystore-password>
    -Dmetadata-keystore.aliases=metadata
    -Dmetadata-keystore.metadata.password=<your-keystore-password>
    -Dmetadata-keystore.metadata.algorithm=AES"
```

## Troubleshooting
The following section includes troubleshooting information.

### Known Issues
* The playbook downloads several large files so you will experience some pauses while they transfer and you'll also see 
the message *"FAILED - RETRYING: Verifying if `<file>` finished downloading (nnn retries left)"* appearing many times. 
Despite the wording this is **not** an error so please ignore and be patient!
* The playbook is not yet fully idempotent (meaning it can be run multiple times with the same result) so may 
cause issues if you make changes and run multiple times
* The `firewalld` service can prevent the playbook from completing successfully if it's blocking the 
[ports required](#tcp-port-configuration) for communication between the roles
* The `nginx` and `adw` roles need to be deployed to the same host otherwise the [playbook fails](#nginx-failure)

### Removing a previous installation
What needs to be removed from a system will depend on your inventory configuration. The steps below presume a localhost 
or single machine installation i.e. where all roles were run on the same machine.

1. Stop and remove the following systemd services:
   * alfresco-transform-router.service
   * alfresco-shared-fs.service
   * alfresco-tengine-aio.service
   * alfresco-sync.service
   * alfresco-search.service
   * alfresco-content.service
   * nginx.service
   * activemq.service
   * postgres-`version`.service (where `version` is 11 for Content Services 6.2.N and 13 for Content Services 7.x)
2. Remove the following yum packages:
   * ImageMagick
   * libreoffice
   * nginx
   * postgresql
3. Remove the following folders:
   * /opt/apache-activemq-`version`
   * /opt/apache-tomcat-`version`
   * /opt/libreoffice`version`
   * /opt/openjdk-`version`
   * /opt/alfresco
   * /etc/opt/alfresco
   * /var/opt/alfresco
   * /var/log/alfresco
   * /tmp/ansible_artefacts
   * /tmp/Alfresco

>**Note**: An additional "uninstall" playbook may be provided in the future.
