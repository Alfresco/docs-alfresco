This information helps you to install Alfresco Content Services, additional software, and modules. You have two main options for installing Alfresco Content Services:

* using the distribution zip
* using containerized deployment

You can install Alfresco Content Services using standard WAR files, contained in the distribution zip, to deploy in a production environment.

You can also install Alfresco Content Services using Docker images that are packaged in Helm charts (as a deployment template for your specific deployment needs), or Docker Compose (for test and development environments only); there is no GUI installer.

**Important:** The deployment of Alfresco Content Services on AWS, such as Amazon EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service), is only recommended for customers with a good knowledge of Alfresco Content Services, and strong competencies in AWS and containerized deployment.
