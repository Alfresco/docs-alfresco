> **Note:** Alfresco customers can view more detailed Release Notes in [Hyland Community](https://community.hyland.com/){:target="_blank"}.

Here's a quick summary of what's new in the Alfresco Content Services 7.2 release.

## Highlights
* **Support for Direct Access URLs** 
* **New storage capabilities for Cloud integrations** 
* **Support for Alfresco Search Enterprise 3.1 with Elasticsearch**
  
### Direct Access URLs
Direct access URLs enable the acceleration of the local download of content to aid distributed content repositories in 
customer environments, and cloud deployments. This allows customers greater flexibility and content storage capabilities 
for highly distributed deployments. The new endpoints are highlighted in the Release Notes that you'll find 
in [Hyland Community](https://community.hyland.com/){:target="_blank"}.

See the Alfresco Content Connector for AWS S3 documentation on [Direct Access URLs]({% link aws-s3/latest/config/direct-access.md %}) 
for more details.

### New storage capabilities for Cloud integrations
Alfresco has built a new Cloud storage layer to make managing content easier for AWS and Azure customers:

* This allows content to easily be located in AWS by adding support for AWS Glacier natively in the S3 Connector to
  allow storage admins to configure their storage and retention policies as needed by their business.
* This allows content to easily be located in Azure by adding support for Azure Cool and Cold storage Blobs natively
  in the Azure Connector to allow storage admins to configure their storage and retention policies as needed by their
  business.
* Additionally, should customers use both AWS and Azure, they can store content on both.

### Search Enterprise 3.1 with Elasticsearch
Enables organizations to easily deploy, use and scale Elasticsearch with Alfresco. Alfresco has been undertaking 
performance testing on Alfresco Search Enterprise and made a number of improvements to increase scalability and 
performance benefiting those customers using Elasticsearch.

## Deprecated software
* AWS Glacier Connector (replaced with AWS S3 Connector 5.n)
* Alfresco Content Services Mobile Application
