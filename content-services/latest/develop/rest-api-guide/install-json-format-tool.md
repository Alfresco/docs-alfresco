title: Install a tool to format JSON responses
---

Information about the `jq` command line tool that can be used to format JSON responses.

The Alfresco ReST API will return responses in JSON format. When we work with the ReST API from the command line via 
cURL these JSON responses will not be formatted in a way that is easily readable.

So it would be good to feed it into some utility that could format the JSON. For this we can use a tool called **jq**. 
It can be found here: [https://stedolan.github.io/jq/](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/){:target="_blank"}. Install it and 
you should be ready to go with the rest of this section.
