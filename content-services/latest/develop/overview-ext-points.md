title: Overview of Extension Points
---

The Alfresco Content Services product has always been very easy to extend and customize so it can manage content from 
different types of domains, such as healthcare, finance, government, insurance, and manufacturing. This is supported by 
so called *Extension Points*. An extension point is a supported interface that can be used to customize the product.

The extension points can be divided into server side extensions to the Platform, also referred to as Repository, 
and UI extensions to the web client called Share.
