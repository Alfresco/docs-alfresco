title: Extension Inspector
---

Alfresco Extension Inspector allows you to analyze Alfresco extensions and to compare them against a particular Content Services version. For example, it helps you to understand how customizations and extensions are affected with a newer version of Content Services, checking for compliance with our best practices and providing recommendations for upgrade impact and safety.

It works with Content Services 5.2 or later Enterprise Editions. The tool also works with other Content Services and Community Edition `.war` files, as long as you can [generate an inventory report](#run-inventory-application).

The Extension Inspector scans and validates an Alfresco [extension (AMP or JAR)]({% link content-services/latest/develop/extension-packaging.md %}) against an `alfresco.war` file.

The main features of the Extension Inspector are:

* Parses Alfresco extensions, for example AMP or JAR files
* Generates a report on possible overrides
* Discourages the use of non-public APIs
* Lists Alfresco's third-party libraries

The Extension Inspector has two main modules:

| Modules | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| Inventory | `extension-inspector-inventory` for parsing an `alfresco.war` file |
| Analyser | `extension-inspector-analyser` for analyzing custom extensions against the inventory |

## Download

You can download the [alfresco-extension-inspector-2.0.0.jar](https://artifacts.alfresco.com/nexus/service/local/repositories/releases/content/org/alfresco/extension-inspector/alfresco-extension-inspector/2.0.0/alfresco-extension-inspector-2.0.0.jar) file from the Alfresco Nexus repository.

>**Note:** See the [Alfresco Extension Inspector](https://github.com/Alfresco/alfresco-extension-inspector){:target="_blank"} GitHub repository for more details.

## Run Inventory application

The application generates a report for a `.war` file.

Use the following command to run the application:

```bash
java -jar alfresco-extension-inspector-<version>.jar --inventory <alfresco_war_path> [--o=<report_file_path>]
```

where:

| Option | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| <nobr>--inventory</nobr> | *Required.* The path to a valid `.war` file that you want to parse. |
| <nobr>--o</nobr> | *Optional.* The output location where the report is generated. You can set this as either a file name or folder location. The report name defaults to `<war_name>.inventory.json`. |
| <nobr>--help</nobr> | *Optional.* Show help text. |

When you run the Inventory command, the output is a report in JSON format with the following example structure:

```json
{
  "schemaVersion" : "1.0",
  "alfrescoVersion" : "6.2.1",
  "resources" :
    {
      "ALFRESCO_PUBLIC_API" :
      [
        {
         "type" : "ALFRESCO_PUBLIC_API",
         "id" : "package.ClassName1",
         "deprecated" : false,
         "implicit" : false
        },
        {
        "type" : "ALFRESCO_PUBLIC_API",
        "id" : "package.ClassName2",
        "deprecated" : true,
        "implicit" : true
        },
        ...
      ],
      "CLASSPATH_ELEMENT" :
      [
        {
          "type" : "CLASSPATH_ELEMENT",
          "id" : "org/alfresco/package1/AClass.class",
          "definingObject" : "WEB-INF/lib/alfresco-library.jar"
        },
        {
          "type" : "CLASSPATH_ELEMENT",
          "id" : "com/3rdparty/packageA/AClass.class",
          "definingObject" : "WEB-INF/lib/3rdparty-library.jar"
        },
        ...
        ],
        "BEAN" :
        [
          {
           "type" : "BEAN",
           "id" : "beanName",
           "definingObject" : "alfresco/aContext.xml@WEB-INF/lib/alfresco-library.jar"
          },
         ...
        ],
        "FILE" :
        [
          {
            "type" : "FILE",
            "id" : "WEB-INF/classes/aFile.ext",
            "definingObject" : "WEB-INF/classes/aFile.ext"
          },
          {
            "type" : "FILE",
            "id" : "WEB-INF/lib/aLibrary.jar",
            "definingObject" : "WEB-INF/lib/aLibrary.jar"
          },
          ...
        ]
}
```

## Run Analyser application

The application analyzes custom extensions against WAR inventories.

Use the following command to run the application:

```bash
java -jar alfresco-extension-inspector-<version>.jar <extension-filename> [--target-version=6.1.0[-23.2.1] | --target-inventory =/path/to/war_inventory.json] [--verbose=[true | false]]
```

where:

| Option | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| extension-filename | *Required.* AMP or JAR file containing an Alfresco extension. |
| <nobr>--target-version</nobr> | *Optional.* A specific Content Services version or range of versions. This option is mutually exclusive to `--target-inventory`. |
| <nobr>--target-inventory</nobr> | *Optional.* The file path to an existing WAR inventory. This option is mutually exclusive to `--target-version`. |
| <nobr>--verbose</nobr> | *Optional.* Show verbose output. |
| <nobr>--list-known-alfresco-versions</nobr> | *Optional.* List all Alfresco versions with inventory reports included in the tool. |
| <nobr>--help</nobr> | *Optional.* Show help text. |

When running the command, `alfresco-extension-inspector` writes the conflicts directly to the console, grouped by type.

### Example commands

Show help text:

```bash
   java -jar alfresco-extension-inspector.jar --help
```

List all Alfresco versions with bundled inventories:

```bash
   java -jar alfresco-extension-inspector.jar --list-known-alfresco-versions
```

The following conflict types are detected:

* File overwrites (`FILE_OVERWRITE`)
* Bean overwrites (`BEAN_OVERWRITE`)
* Classpath conflicts (`CLASSPATH_CONFLICT`)
* Beans instantiating restricted classes (`BEAN_RESTRICTED_CLASS`)
* Usage of non @AlfrescoPublicAPI classes (`ALFRESCO_INTERNAL_USAGE`)
* Usage of 3rd party libraries (`WAR_LIBRARY_USAGE`)
* Jakarta migration dependency conflicts (`JAKARTA_MIGRATION_CONFLICT`)

The output is a report with the following example structure.

### Bean naming conflicts

```text
The following Spring beans defined in the extension module are in conflict with
beans defined in the ACS repository:
    extension_bean

Spring beans are the basic building blocks of the ACS repository. Replacing these
will alter the behaviour of the system and can lead to unexpected behaviour.
Since all these beans are subject to change between Alfresco versions and even in
service packs, these modifications are typically bound to a specific Alfresco
version.
You should avoid redefining default beans of the ACS repository in your
extensions to reduce the cost of upgrades.
It is possible that these conflicts only exist in specific ACS versions. Run this
tool with the -verbose option to get a complete list of versions where each of
these files has conflicts.
```

### Beans instantiating internal classes

```text
The following Spring beans defined in the extension module instantiate internal
classes:
    extension_bean (class=org.alfresco.repo.... )

These classes are considered an internal implementation detail of the ACS
repository and do not constitute a supported extension point. They might change
or completely disappear between ACS versions and even in service packs.
```

### Classpath conflicts

```text
The following files and libraries in the extension module cause conflicts on the
Java classpath:
    /lib/alfresco-test.jar

Ambiguous resources on the Java classpath render the behaviour of the JVM
undefined (see Java specification).
Although it might be possible that the repository can still start-up, you can
expect erroneous behavior in certain situations. Problems of this kind are
typically very hard to detect and trace back to their root cause.
It is possible that these conflicts only exist in specific ACS versions. Run this
tool with the -verbose option to get a complete list of versions where each of
these files has conflicts.
```

### Custom code using internal classes

```text
The following classes defined in the extension module are using internal
repository classes:
    org.alfresco.repo...

Internal repository classes:
    org.alfresco.repo...

These classes are considered an internal implementation detail of the ACS
repository and might change or completely disappear between ACS versions and even
between service packs.
For a complete usage matrix, use the -verbose option of this tool.
```

### Custom code using 3rd party libraries managed by the ACS repository

```text
The code provided by the extension module is using these 3rd party libraries
brought by the ACS repository:
    /WEB-INF/lib/test-1.0.0.jar

These 3rd party libraries are managed by the ACS repository and are subject to
constant change, even in service packs and hotfixes.
Each of these libraries has its own backward compatibility strategy, which will
make it really hard for this extension to keep up with these changes.
```

### Incompatible Jakarta migration dependencies

```text
The following classes defined in the extension module are using incompatible jakarta migration dependencies:

  org.alfresco.utility.data.DataEmail
  org.alfresco.utility.data.DataEmail$1
Jakarta migration dependencies:
  jakarta.mail.Authenticator
  jakarta.mail.Flags
  jakarta.mail.Flags$Flag
  jakarta.mail.Folder
  jakarta.mail.Message
  jakarta.mail.MessagingException
  jakarta.mail.Session
  jakarta.mail.Store
  jakarta.mail.internet.MimeMessage
  jakarta.mail.search.AndTerm
  jakarta.mail.search.FlagTerm
  jakarta.mail.search.SearchTerm

Classes using non-jakarta migrated dependencies are incompatible with a jakarta migrated ACS version, and vice versa.
For a complete usage matrix, use the -verbose option of this tool.
```

### REPORT SUMMARY

```text
Across the provided target versions, the following number of conflicts have been
found:

+--------------------------+-----+
|Type                      |Total|
+--------------------------+-----+
|BEAN_OVERWRITE            |1    |
+--------------------------+-----+
|BEAN_RESTRICTED_CLASS     |1    |
+--------------------------+-----+
|CLASSPATH_CONFLICT        |1    |
+--------------------------+-----+
|ALFRESCO_INTERNAL_USAGE   |2    |
+--------------------------+-----+
|WAR_LIBRARY_USAGE         |1    |
+--------------------------+-----+
|JAKARTA_MIGRATION_CONFLICT|2    |
+--------------------------+-----+

(use option --verbose for version details)
```

Alfresco extensions might hide conflicts of the following types if they contain Alfresco-specific libraries:

* `BEAN_RESTRICTED_CLASS`
* `WAR_LIBRARY_USAGE`
* `ALFRESCO_INTERNAL_USAGE`

They are hidden because these types of conflict exclude from processing all the classes in the extension's classpath.
By including a class present in both extension and WAR in the processing, this may partially solve the issue because:

* Two classes with the same canonical name could come from two different libraries, for example, an extension-specific library and an Alfresco library, or two different versions of the same Alfresco library. Therefore, checking the class name alone is not enough.
* Comparing their libraries would help only when the same library with the same version is used in both the extension and the WAR. In case of different versions of the same library, the class won't be recognized as an Alfresco internal class.
