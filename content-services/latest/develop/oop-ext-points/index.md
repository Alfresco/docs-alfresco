title: Overview of out-of-process platform extension points
---

Out-of-process Platform Extensions are extensions that run outside the Alfresco servers in its own processes. 

The [event system]({% link content-services/latest/develop/oop-ext-points/events.md %}) introduced in Content Services 7 enables 
out-of-process extensions. To support the event system a [ReST API Java Wrapper]({% link content-services/latest/develop/oop-ext-points/rest-api-java-wrapper.md %}) 
is provided for easy development of extensions from Java applications.

You should get familiar with the [Out-of-Process SDK]({% link content-services/latest/develop/oop-sdk.md %}) as it is 
the recommended way of developing out-of-process extensions.

Read through the [Getting started guide]({% link content-services/latest/develop/index.md %}) to get up to 
speed on the difference between in-process and out-of-process extensions.

To fully understand the platform extension points it is a good idea to read through the  
[Platform Architecture]({% link content-services/latest/develop/software-architecture.md %}#platformarch) section.
