title: Events Extension Point
---

When implementing business logic an out-of-process model should be used. For example, if some processing should be done
every time a PDF is uploaded to a specific folder, then there is an event that can be subscribed to and the business logic 
can be implemented in an external process separate from the Content Services server process.

Architecture Information: [Platform Architecture]({% link content-services/latest/develop/software-architecture.md %}#platformarch)

## Event Model {#eventmodel}

The event model in Content Services is a library packaged as a JAR file, which is part of the repository (i.e. `alfresco.war`). 
The library contains the event model and the databind helpers used to help the clients to marshall and unmarshall the events.

The event model is based on the [CloudEvents specification](https://github.com/cloudevents/spec/blob/v1.0/spec.md){:target="_blank"}.
CloudEvents is a specification for describing event data in common formats to provide interoperability across services, 
platforms and systems. For more information see [CloudEvents Primer](https://github.com/cloudevents/spec/blob/v1.0/primer.md){:target="_blank"}.

The Content Services event payload (i.e. the part of transmitted data that is the actual intended message) consist
of two parts. The CloudEvent attributes and the Content Services event attributes.

```json
{
  CloudEvent standard attributes...
  "data": {
    Content Services custom event attributes... 
  }

}
```

Basic configuration of the event system is in the [repository.properties](https://github.com/Alfresco/alfresco-community-repo/blob/master/repository/src/main/resources/alfresco/repository.properties){:target="_blank"}
file:

```text
### Repository events2
#
# Type and aspect filters which should be excluded.
# Note: System folder node types are added by default.
repo.event2.filter.nodeTypes=sys:*, fm:*, cm:thumbnail, cm:failedThumbnail, cm:rating, rma:rmsite include_subtypes
repo.event2.filter.nodeAspects=sys:*
repo.event2.filter.childAssocTypes=rn:rendition
#
# Comma separated list of users which should be excluded
# Note: username's case-sensitivity depends on the {user.name.caseSensitive} setting
repo.event2.filter.users=System, null
#
# Topic name
repo.event2.topic.endpoint=amqp:topic:alfresco.repo.event2
```                                                 

Any custom configuration, to for example the default event filtering, can be done in `alfresco-global.properties`.

### CloudEvent attributes

### Content Services event types {#acseventtypes}

The following are the different types of events that can be subscribed to:

|Name                              |Description                                                      |
|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
|`org.alfresco.event.node.Created`|Occurs when a node is created.|
|`org.alfresco.event.node.Updated`|Occurs when a node is updated or moved. Currently only node's name, type, properties, aspects, and content are supported.|
|`org.alfresco.event.node.Deleted`|Occurs when a node is deleted.|
|`org.alfresco.event.assoc.child.Created`|Occurs when a secondary child association is created.<br><br>**Note.** This event is not triggered for `cm:contains` primary parent-child associations. I.e. when a file or folder is created.|

|`org.alfresco.event.assoc.peer.Deleted`|Occurs when a peer association is deleted.|

TODO: OnPermissionUpdatedEventHandler (Enterprise)

## Event descriptions

Let's have a look at each event and see what we can use it for when implementing business logic for a 
particular content domain.

Content Services events are published on the [JMS Topic](http://activemq.apache.org/how-does-a-queue-compare-to-a-topic.html){:target="_blank"} 
called `alfresco.repo.event2`. See (search) default configuration in the [repository.properties](https://github.com/Alfresco/alfresco-community-repo/blob/master/repository/src/main/resources/alfresco/repository.properties){:target="_blank"} file.
So a Camel Route could for example be configured to pick up events from `amqpConnection:topic:alfresco.repo.event2`. The `amqpConnection` to the 
[Active MQ](http://activemq.apache.org) endpoint in the Content Services server would then be configured to connect to `amqp://localhost:5672`.

### Node created event

This event is fired whenever a node, such as a folder or file, is created in the repository. The full name of this 
event is `org.alfresco.event.node.Created`. 

Here is an example payload for this event type:

```json
{
  "specversion": "1.0",
  "type": "org.alfresco.event.node.Created",
  "id": "368818d9-dddd-4b8b-8eab-e050253d7f61",
  "source": "/08d9b620-48de-4247-8f33-360988d3b19b",
  "time": "2021-01-21T11:14:16.42372Z",
  "dataschema": "https://api.alfresco.com/schema/event/repo/v1/nodeCreated",
  "datacontenttype": "application/json",
  "data": {
    "eventGroupId": "4004ca99-9d2a-400d-9d80-8f840e223581",
    "resource": {
      "@type": "NodeResource",
      "id": "d71dd823-82c7-477c-8490-04cb0e826e65",
      "primaryHierarchy": [
        "5f355d16-f824-4173-bf4b-b1ec37ef5549",
        "93f7edf5-e4d8-4749-9b4c-e45097e2e19d",
        "c388532e-8da6-4d50-a6d2-4f3f3ac36ff7",
        "2fa2cde5-9d83-4460-a38c-cfe4ec9cca08" 
      ],
      "name": "purchase-order-scan.pdf",
      "nodeType": "cm:content",
      "createdByUser": {
        "id": "admin",
        "displayName": "Administrator"
      },
      "createdAt": "2021-01-21T11:14:15.695Z",
      "modifiedByUser": {
        "id": "admin",
        "displayName": "Administrator"
      },
      "modifiedAt": "2021-01-21T11:14:15.695Z",
      "content": {
        "mimeType": "application/pdf",
        "sizeInBytes": 531152,
        "encoding": "UTF-8"
      },
      "properties": {
        "cm:autoVersion": true,
        "cm:versionType": "MAJOR",
        "cm:autoVersionOnUpdateProps": false,
        "cm:versionLabel": "1.0",
        "cm:initialVersion": true
      },
      "aspectNames": [
        "cm:versionable",
        "cm:auditable"
      ],
      "isFolder": false,
      "isFile": true
    },
    "resourceReaderAuthorities": [
      "GROUP_EVERYONE"
    ],
    "resourceDeniedAuthorities": []
  }
}
```

Using the [Node Browser]({% link content-services/latest/admin/troubleshoot.md %}#usingnodebrowser) the following 
`NodeRefs` were resolved as follows:

```json
  "id": "d71dd823-82c7-477c-8490-04cb0e826e65",   /app:company_home/cm:Testing/cm:Inbound/cm:purchase-order-scan.pdf (cm:content)
  "primaryHierarchy": [
    "5f355d16-f824-4173-bf4b-b1ec37ef5549",       /app:company_home/cm:Testing/cm:Inbound  (cm:folder)
    "93f7edf5-e4d8-4749-9b4c-e45097e2e19d",       /app:company_home/cm:Testing             (cm:folder)
    "c388532e-8da6-4d50-a6d2-4f3f3ac36ff7",       /app:company_home                        (cm:folder)
    "2fa2cde5-9d83-4460-a38c-cfe4ec9cca08"        Store root                               (sys:store_root)
```

The event payload is telling us that a file called `purchase-order-scan.pdf` (i.e. `data.resource.name`) of type `cm:content` 
(i.e. `data.resource.nodeType`) was created by the user `admin` (i.e. `data.resource.createdByUser.id`) in the 
**/Company Home/Testing/Inbound** folder (i.e. `data.resource.primaryHierarchy[0]`). The new node has a Node ID 
`d71dd823-82c7-477c-8490-04cb0e826e65` (i.e. `data.resource.id`).

To find out the display name for a folder or file via its Node ID use the ReST API to 
[get metadata]({% link content-services/latest/develop/rest-api-guide/folders-files.md %}#getnodemetadata). This 
call can also be used to get other properties for the created node as not all are returned in the event data 
(i.e. `data.resource.properties`).

When subscribing to the `org.alfresco.event.node.Created` event it's possible to filter out anything that is
of no interest. So for example, if you are interested in files with content type `cm:content` uploaded to a folder 
called **/Company Home/Testing/Inbound** (e.g. Node ID `5f355d16-f824-4173-bf4b-b1ec37ef5549`) it would be easy to 
configure this. The following code snippet shows how this could be done with an 
[Apache Camel route](https://camel.apache.org/manual/latest/routes.html){:target="_blank"} configuration:

```java
public class SimpleRoute extends RouteBuilder {

    @Override
    public void configure() {

        from("amqpConnection:topic:alfresco.repo.event2")
            .id("CreatedFileRoute")
            .log("${body}") 
            .choice() 
            .when() // When the following is true:
                // The event type is node created
                .jsonpath("$[?(@.type=='org.alfresco.event.node.Created' && " +   
                // The node that was created is a file
                "@.data.resource.nodeType=='cm:content' && " +            
                // The file is located in the /Company Home/Testing/Inbound folder
                "'5f355d16-f824-4173-bf4b-b1ec37ef5549' in @.data.resource.primaryHierarchy[:1])]")
            // Unpack the data into JSON format  
            .unmarshal("publicDataFormat")
            // Call a Spring Bean with the event data 
            .bean("eventHandlerImpl", "onReceive(*, COPY)") 
            .end();
    }
}
```

The `jsonpath` expression uses several of the event data properties to filter out exactly the events we are interested in.

In this case a Spring Bean with ID `eventHandlerImpl` is called at the end of the route from where you could make the 
necessary ReST API calls.

### Node updated event

This event is fired whenever a node, such as a folder or file, is updated or moved in the repository. The full name of this 
event is `org.alfresco.event.node.Updated`. The event is fired when the node's name, type, properties, aspects, or content 
is updated.

Here is an example payload for this event type:

```json
{
  "specversion": "1.0",
  "type": "org.alfresco.event.node.Updated",
  "id": "ae5dac3c-25d0-438d-b148-2084d1ab05a6",
  "source": "/08d9b620-48de-4247-8f33-360988d3b19b",
  "time": "2021-01-26T10:29:42.99524Z",
  "dataschema": "https://api.alfresco.com/schema/event/repo/v1/nodeUpdated",
  "datacontenttype": "application/json",
  "data": {
    "eventGroupId": "b5b1ebfe-45fc-4f86-b71b-421996482881",
    "resource": {
      "@type": "NodeResource",
      "id": "d71dd823-82c7-477c-8490-04cb0e826e65",
      "primaryHierarchy": [
        "5f355d16-f824-4173-bf4b-b1ec37ef5549",
        "93f7edf5-e4d8-4749-9b4c-e45097e2e19d",
        "c388532e-8da6-4d50-a6d2-4f3f3ac36ff7",
        "2fa2cde5-9d83-4460-a38c-cfe4ec9cca08"
      ],
      "name": "purchase-order-scan.pdf",
      "nodeType": "cm:content",
      "createdByUser": {
        "id": "admin",
        "displayName": "Administrator"
      },
      "createdAt": "2021-01-21T11:14:15.695Z",
      "modifiedByUser": {
        "id": "admin",
        "displayName": "Administrator"
      },
      "modifiedAt": "2021-01-26T10:29:42.529Z",
      "content": {
        "mimeType": "application/pdf",
        "sizeInBytes": 531152,
        "encoding": "UTF-8"
      },
      "properties": {
        "cm:autoVersion": true,
        "cm:title": "Purchase Order",
        "cm:versionType": "MAJOR",
        "cm:versionLabel": "1.0",
        "cm:autoVersionOnUpdateProps": false,
        "cm:lastThumbnailModification": [
          "doclib:1611227666770"
        ],
        "cm:description": "",
        "cm:taggable": null,
        "cm:initialVersion": true
      },
      "aspectNames": [
        "cm:versionable",
        "cm:author",
        "cm:thumbnailModification",
        "cm:titled",
        "rn:renditioned",
        "cm:auditable",
        "cm:taggable"
      ],
      "isFolder": false,
      "isFile": true
    },
    "resourceBefore": {
      "@type": "NodeResource",
      "modifiedAt": "2021-01-21T11:14:25.223Z",
      "properties": {
        "cm:title": null,
        "cm:taggable": null,
        "cm:description": null
      },
      "aspectNames": [
        "cm:versionable",
        "cm:author",
        "cm:thumbnailModification",
        "cm:titled",
        "rn:renditioned",
        "cm:auditable"
      ]
    },
    "resourceReaderAuthorities": [
      "GROUP_EVERYONE"
    ],
    "resourceDeniedAuthorities": []
  }
}
```

The event data payload looks very similar to the data for a created node. There is just one extra object called
`resourceBefore` that contains the property values before the update. In this case we can see that the `cm:title` property
of the `cm:titled` aspect has been filled in (i.e. `data.resource.properties.cm:title: "Purchase Order"`).

Using the [Node Browser]({% link content-services/latest/admin/troubleshoot.md %}#usingnodebrowser) the following 
`NodeRefs` were resolved as follows:

```json
  "id": "d71dd823-82c7-477c-8490-04cb0e826e65",   /app:company_home/cm:Testing/cm:Inbound/cm:purchase-order-scan.pdf (cm:content)
  "primaryHierarchy": [
    "5f355d16-f824-4173-bf4b-b1ec37ef5549",       /app:company_home/cm:Testing/cm:Inbound  (cm:folder)
    "93f7edf5-e4d8-4749-9b4c-e45097e2e19d",       /app:company_home/cm:Testing             (cm:folder)
    "c388532e-8da6-4d50-a6d2-4f3f3ac36ff7",       /app:company_home                        (cm:folder)
    "2fa2cde5-9d83-4460-a38c-cfe4ec9cca08"        Store root                               (sys:store_root)
```

The event payload is telling us that a file called `purchase-order-scan.pdf` (i.e. `data.resource.name`) of type `cm:content` 
(i.e. `data.resource.nodeType`) was updated by the user `admin` (i.e. `data.resource.createdByUser.id`) in the 
**/Company Home/Testing/Inbound** folder (i.e. `data.resource.primaryHierarchy[0]`). The updated node has a Node ID 
`d71dd823-82c7-477c-8490-04cb0e826e65` (i.e. `data.resource.id`).

To find out the display name for a folder or file via its Node ID use the ReST API to 
[get metadata]({% link content-services/latest/develop/rest-api-guide/folders-files.md %}#getnodemetadata). This 
call can also be used to get other properties for the created node as not all are returned in the event data 
(i.e. `data.resource.properties`).

When subscribing to the `org.alfresco.event.node.Updated` event it's possible to filter out anything that is
of no interest. So for example, if you are interested in files with content type `cm:content` updated in the folder 
called **/Company Home/Testing/Inbound** (e.g. Node ID `5f355d16-f824-4173-bf4b-b1ec37ef5549`) it would be easy to 
configure this. The following code snippet shows how this could be done with an 
[Apache Camel route](https://camel.apache.org/manual/latest/routes.html){:target="_blank"} configuration:

```java
public class SimpleRoute extends RouteBuilder {

    @Override
    public void configure() {
        from("amqpConnection:topic:alfresco.repo.event2")
            .id("UpdatedFileRoute")
            .log("${body}") // Log all incoming events on this topic, even those that we are not interested in
            .choice()
            .when() // When the following is true:
                // The event type is node updated
                .jsonpath("$[?(@.type=='org.alfresco.event.node.Updated' && " +
                // and the node that was updated is a file
                "@.data.resource.nodeType=='cm:content' && " +
                // and the file is located in the /Company Home/Testing/Inbound folder
                "'5f355d16-f824-4173-bf4b-b1ec37ef5549' in @.data.resource.primaryHierarchy[:1])]")
            // Unpack the data into JSON format
            .unmarshal("publicDataFormat")
            // Call a Spring Bean with the event data
            .bean("updatedEventHandlerImpl", "onReceive(*, COPY)")
            .end();
    }
}
```

The `jsonpath` expression uses several of the event data properties to filter out exactly the events we are interested in.

In this case a Spring Bean with ID `updatedEventHandlerImpl` is called at the end of the route from where you could make the 
necessary ReST API calls.

### Node deleted event

This event is fired whenever a node, such as a folder or file, is deleted in the repository. The full name of this 
event is `org.alfresco.event.node.Deleted`. 

Here is an example payload for this event type:

```json
{
  "specversion": "1.0",
  "type": "org.alfresco.event.node.Deleted",
  "id": "df329995-d744-427c-bafb-4a31ba7d50e3",

  "datacontenttype": "application/json",
  "data": {
    "eventGroupId": "acb8e25f-a340-48b5-8de8-249ae5bac670",
    "resource": {
      "@type": "NodeResource",
      "id": "d71dd823-82c7-477c-8490-04cb0e826e65",
      "primaryHierarchy": [
        "5f355d16-f824-4173-bf4b-b1ec37ef5549",
        "93f7edf5-e4d8-4749-9b4c-e45097e2e19d",
        "c388532e-8da6-4d50-a6d2-4f3f3ac36ff7",
        "2fa2cde5-9d83-4460-a38c-cfe4ec9cca08"
      ],
      "name": "purchase-order-scan.pdf",
      "nodeType": "cm:content",
      "createdByUser": {
        "id": "admin",
        "displayName": "Administrator"
      },
      "createdAt": "2021-01-21T11:14:15.695Z",
      "modifiedByUser": {
        "id": "admin",
        "displayName": "Administrator"
      },
      "modifiedAt": "2021-01-26T10:29:42.529Z",
      "content": {
        "mimeType": "application/pdf",
        "sizeInBytes": 531152,
        "encoding": "UTF-8"
      },
      "properties": {
        "cm:autoVersion": true,
        "cm:title": "Purchase Order",
        "cm:versionType": "MAJOR",
        "cm:versionLabel": "1.0",
        "cm:autoVersionOnUpdateProps": false,
        "cm:lastThumbnailModification": [
          "doclib:1611227666770"
        ],
        "cm:description": "",
        "cm:taggable": null,
        "cm:initialVersion": true
      },
      "aspectNames": [
        "cm:versionable",
        "cm:author",
        "cm:thumbnailModification",
        "cm:titled",
        "rn:renditioned",
        "cm:auditable",
        "cm:taggable"
      ],
      "isFolder": false,
      "isFile": true
    },
    "resourceReaderAuthorities": [],
    "resourceDeniedAuthorities": []
  }
}
```

The event data payload looks very similar to the data for a created node. Using the 
[Node Browser]({% link content-services/latest/admin/troubleshoot.md %}#usingnodebrowser) the following 
`NodeRefs` were resolved as follows:

```json
  "id": "d71dd823-82c7-477c-8490-04cb0e826e65",   /app:company_home/cm:Testing/cm:Inbound/cm:purchase-order-scan.pdf (cm:content)
  "primaryHierarchy": [
    "5f355d16-f824-4173-bf4b-b1ec37ef5549",       /app:company_home/cm:Testing/cm:Inbound  (cm:folder)
    "93f7edf5-e4d8-4749-9b4c-e45097e2e19d",       /app:company_home/cm:Testing             (cm:folder)
    "c388532e-8da6-4d50-a6d2-4f3f3ac36ff7",       /app:company_home                        (cm:folder)
    "2fa2cde5-9d83-4460-a38c-cfe4ec9cca08"        Store root                               (sys:store_root)
```

The event payload is telling us that a file called `purchase-order-scan.pdf` (i.e. `data.resource.name`) of type `cm:content` 
(i.e. `data.resource.nodeType`) was deleted by the user `admin` (i.e. `data.resource.createdByUser.id`) in the 
**/Company Home/Testing/Inbound** folder (i.e. `data.resource.primaryHierarchy[0]`). The deleted node had a Node ID 
`d71dd823-82c7-477c-8490-04cb0e826e65` (i.e. `data.resource.id`). Note that the deleted node is soft deleted and is now
available in the trash can.

When subscribing to the `org.alfresco.event.node.Deleted` event it's possible to filter out anything that is
of no interest. So for example, if you are interested in files with content type `cm:content` deleted in the folder 
called **/Company Home/Testing/Inbound** (e.g. Node ID `5f355d16-f824-4173-bf4b-b1ec37ef5549`) it would be easy to 
configure this. The following code snippet shows how this could be done with an 
[Apache Camel route](https://camel.apache.org/manual/latest/routes.html){:target="_blank"} configuration:

```java
public class SimpleRoute extends RouteBuilder {

    @Override
    public void configure() {
        from("amqpConnection:topic:alfresco.repo.event2")
            .id("DeletedFileRoute")
            .log("${body}") // Log all incoming events on this topic, even those that we are not interested in
            .choice()
            .when() // When the following is true:
            // The event type is node deleted
            .jsonpath("$[?(@.type=='org.alfresco.event.node.Deleted' && " +
                    // and the node that was deleted is a file
                    "@.data.resource.nodeType=='cm:content' && " +
                    // and the file is located in the /Company Home/Testing/Inbound folder
                    "'5f355d16-f824-4173-bf4b-b1ec37ef5549' in @.data.resource.primaryHierarchy[:1])]")
            // Unpack the data into JSON format
            .unmarshal("publicDataFormat")
            // Call a Spring Bean with the event data
            .bean("deletedEventHandlerImpl", "onReceive(*, COPY)")
            .end();
    }
}
```

The `jsonpath` expression uses several of the event data properties to filter out exactly the events we are interested in.

In this case a Spring Bean with ID `deletedEventHandlerImpl` is called at the end of the route from where you could make the 
necessary ReST API calls.

### Parent-Child association created event

This event is fired whenever a **secondary** parent -> child association is created, such as via the the 
[POST nodes/{parentId}/secondary-children]({% link content-services/latest/develop/rest-api-guide/folders-files.md %}#createparentchildassoc4nodeexist)  
ReST API. The full name of this event is `org.alfresco.event.assoc.child.Created`. 

>**Note** that this event will not be generated when a file is created or a folder is created. In this case the **primary** 
parent -> child association (i.e. `cm:contains`) is created but an event for this association is not triggered. You will 
have to listen to the `org.alfresco.event.node.Created` event instead, and from the data for this event you can get to the 
**primary** parent -> child association.  

Here is an example payload for this event type:

```json
{
  "specversion": "1.0",
  "type": "org.alfresco.event.assoc.child.Created",
  "id": "4014bcb2-f1e6-447f-8caa-3a6219bc94ad",
  "source": "/08d9b620-48de-4247-8f33-360988d3b19b",
  "time": "2021-01-28T13:42:34.329162Z",
  "dataschema": "https://api.alfresco.com/schema/event/repo/v1/childAssocCreated",
  "datacontenttype": "application/json",
  "data": {
    "eventGroupId": "78da21cc-fa5a-47d1-afcb-03005229efa9",
    "resource": {
      "@type": "ChildAssociationResource",
      "assocType": "fdk:images",
      "parent": {
        "id": "a4eb7684-0ffe-4bf5-b6f7-4297a6e4ee84"
      },
      "child": {
        "id": "ceb3c804-8b32-4050-b2da-b55c47f01666"    
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Using the [Node Browser]({% link content-services/latest/admin/troubleshoot.md %}#usingnodebrowser) the following 
`NodeRefs` were resolved as follows:

```json
  "parent": {
    "id": "a4eb7684-0ffe-4bf5-b6f7-4297a6e4ee84"  /app:company_home/cm:My_x0020_Gadgets/cm:My_x0020_Gadget

```

The event payload is telling us that a secondary parent-child association of type `fdk:images` (i.e. `data.resource.assocType`) 
was set up between a gadget file `My Gadget` (i.e. `data.resource.parent`) and a gadget image `gadget-picture.png` 
(i.e. `data.resource.child`).

When subscribing to the `org.alfresco.event.assoc.child.Created` event it's possible to filter out anything that is
of no interest. So for example, if you are only interested in associations of type `fdk:images` it would be easy to 
configure this. The following code snippet shows how this could be done with an 
[Apache Camel route](https://camel.apache.org/manual/latest/routes.html){:target="_blank"} configuration:

```java

    @Override

        from("amqpConnection:topic:alfresco.repo.event2")
            .id("ParentChildAssocCreatedRoute")
            .log("${body}") // Log all incoming events on this topic, even those that we are not interested in
            .choice()
            .when() // When the following is true:
            // The event type is parent-child assoc created
            .jsonpath("$[?(@.type=='org.alfresco.event.assoc.child.Created' && " +
                    // and the association type is fdk:images
                    "@.data.resource.assocType=='fdk:images')]" )
            // Unpack the data into JSON format
            .unmarshal("publicDataFormat")
            // Call a Spring Bean with the event data
            .bean("parentChildAssocCreatedEventHandlerImpl", "onReceive(*, COPY)")
            .end();
    }
}
```

The `jsonpath` expression uses several of the event data properties to filter out exactly the events we are interested in.

In this case a Spring Bean with ID `parentChildAssocCreatedEventHandlerImpl` is called at the end of the route from 
where you could make the necessary ReST API calls.

### Parent-Child association deleted event

This event is fired whenever a **secondary** parent -> child association is deleted, such as via the the 
[DELETE nodes/{parentId}/secondary-children]({% link content-services/latest/develop/rest-api-guide/folders-files.md %}##deletingassociations)  
ReST API. The full name of this event is `org.alfresco.event.assoc.child.Deleted`. 

>**Note** that this event will not be generated when a file is deleted or a folder is deleted. In this case the **primary** 
parent -> child association (i.e. `cm:contains`) is deleted but an event for this association is not triggered. You will 
have to listen to the `org.alfresco.event.node.Deleted` event instead, and from the data for this event you can get data for 
the deleted **primary** parent -> child association.  

Here is an example payload for this event type:

```json
{
  "specversion": "1.0",
  "type": "org.alfresco.event.assoc.child.Deleted",
  "id": "80a8b1db-9bac-4f20-8273-025bc555ba61",

      }
    }
  }
}
```

Using the [Node Browser]({% link content-services/latest/admin/troubleshoot.md %}#usingnodebrowser) the following

  },
  "child": {
    "id": "ceb3c804-8b32-4050-b2da-b55c47f01666"  /sys:archivedItem/gadget-picture.png
```

The event payload is telling us that a secondary parent-child association of type `fdk:images` (i.e. `data.resource.assocType`) 
was deleted between a gadget file `My Gadget` (i.e. `data.resource.parent`) and a gadget review `gadget-picture.png` 
(i.e. `data.resource.child`).

>**Note**. when you use the Node Browser to look for the deleted `gadget-picture.png` file (i.e. with ID ceb3c804-8b32-4050-b2da-b55c47f01666) 
you have to search in the `archive://SpacesStore` store to find it. This store contains soft deleted files. 

When subscribing to the `org.alfresco.event.assoc.child.Deleted` event it's possible to filter out anything that is
of no interest. So for example, if you are only interested in associations of type `fdk:images` it would be easy to 
configure this. The following code snippet shows how this could be done with an 
[Apache Camel route](https://camel.apache.org/manual/latest/routes.html){:target="_blank"} configuration:

            .choice()
            .when() // When the following is true:

            .jsonpath("$[?(@.type=='org.alfresco.event.assoc.child.Deleted' && " +
                    // and the association type is fdk:images
                    "@.data.resource.assocType=='fdk:images')]" )
            // Unpack the data into JSON format
            .unmarshal("publicDataFormat")
            // Call a Spring Bean with the event data
            .bean("parentChildAssocDeletedEventHandlerImpl", "onReceive(*, COPY)")

[POST nodes/{sourceId}/targets]({% link content-services/latest/develop/rest-api-guide/folders-files.md %}#createparentchildassoc4nodeexist)  
ReST API. The full name of this event is `org.alfresco.event.assoc.peer.Created`.

Using the [Node Browser]({% link content-services/latest/admin/troubleshoot.md %}#usingnodebrowser) the following 
`NodeRefs` were resolved as follows:

```json
  "source": {
    "id": "a4eb7684-0ffe-4bf5-b6f7-4297a6e4ee84"  /app:company_home/cm:My_x0020_Gadgets/cm:My_x0020_Gadget  
  },
  "target": {
    "id": "f826ac49-0262-48af-8f63-f87eb7007078"  /sys:archivedItem/gadget-review.txt
```

The event payload is telling us that a peer association of type `fdk:reviews` (i.e. `data.resource.assocType`) 
was deleted between a gadget file `My Gadget` (i.e. `data.resource.source`) and a gadget review `gadget-review.txt` 
(i.e. `data.resource.target`).

>**Note**. when you use the Node Browser to look for the deleted `gadget-review.txt` file (i.e. with ID f826ac49-0262-48af-8f63-f87eb7007078) 
you have to search in the `archive://SpacesStore` store to find it. This store contains soft deleted files. 

When subscribing to the `org.alfresco.event.assoc.peer.Deleted` event it's possible to filter out anything that is
of no interest. So for example, if you are only interested in associations of type `fdk:reviews` it would be easy to 
configure this. The following code snippet shows how this could be done with an 
[Apache Camel route](https://camel.apache.org/manual/latest/routes.html){:target="_blank"} configuration:

```java
public class SimpleRoute extends RouteBuilder {

    @Override
    public void configure() {
        from("amqpConnection:topic:alfresco.repo.event2")
            .id("PeerAssocDeletedRoute")
            .log("${body}") // Log all incoming events on this topic, even those that we are not interested in
            .choice()
            .when() // When the following is true:
            // The event type is peer assoc deleted
            .jsonpath("$[?(@.type=='org.alfresco.event.assoc.peer.Deleted' && " +
                    // and the association type is fdk:reviews
                    "@.data.resource.assocType=='fdk:reviews')]" )
            // Unpack the data into JSON format
            .unmarshal("publicDataFormat")
            // Call a Spring Bean with the event data
            .bean("peerAssocDeletedEventHandlerImpl", "onReceive(*, COPY)")
            .end();
    }
}
```

The `jsonpath` expression uses several of the event data properties to filter out exactly the events we are interested in.

In this case a Spring Bean with ID `peerAssocDeletedEventHandlerImpl` is called at the end of the route from 
where you could make the necessary ReST API calls.
