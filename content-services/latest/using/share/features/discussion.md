The discussion forum lets you post user-generated content related to a site. These topics often take the form of questions or comments with threaded discussions.

Members of a site can create new topics and can also reply to a posting to take part in a discussion on a specific topic.

> **Note:** See [Customizing a site]({% link content-services/latest/using/share/sites.md %}#customizesite) for how to switch the discussion forum on and off for a site.

## Accessing the discussion forum

Access the discussion forum to view the discussion topics for the current site.

Within a discussion you can create new topics, as well as edit and delete topics you created. You can also take part in a discussion by replying to a topic.

1. In a site click **More** then **Discussions**.

    > **Note:** In each site the feature names can be customized. If the site manager has done this, the link might have a name other than **Discussions**.

    This opens the discussion forum. The main page defaults to the **New** view so you see a list of the topics created in the past seven days. The summary includes:

    * the topic title
    * the date and time the topic was created
    * the user who created the topic
    * the number of replies to the topic

    * the tags associated with the topic

## Browsing the discussion topics

The browsing feature in the discussions forum lets you filter the discussion topics so you can more easily navigate the content.

* **New**: Displays the topics created or updated in the past seven days
* **Most Active**: Displays the topics with the most replies
* **All**: Displays all topics
* **My Topics**: Displays the topics created by the current user

The **Tags** list displays the tags currently associated with one or more discussion topics. The number following the tag tells you how many discussion topics are associated with the tag.

    1. In the **Topics** list click a view to display the discussion topics in the current site that correspond to that selection.
