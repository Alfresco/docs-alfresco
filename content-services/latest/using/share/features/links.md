The links component lets site members compile a list of web links that are related to the site or that might be of 
interest to site users. These can be internal links pointing to site pages or external links pointing to any web address.

The comment feature allows site members to add and manage comments on the site links.

> **Note:** See [Customizing a site]({% link content-services/latest/using/share/sites.md %}#customizesite) for how to switch links on and off for a site.

## Accessing the site links

Access the site links component to view the web links compiled for the current site.

In this component you can create new links, as well as edit and delete the links that you created. You can add a comment to any link listed.

1. In a site click **More** then **Links**.

    > **Note:** In each site the feature names can be customized. If the site manager has done this, the link might have a name other than **Links**.
