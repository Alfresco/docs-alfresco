The wiki lets site users create pages for a collaborative wiki.

When you enter the wiki the page view displays the wiki main page. Click **Wiki Page List** to display the wiki list.

The wiki page list displays a summary of all pages created for the current site's wiki. Select a page in this list to view it in the page view.

In both views (wiki list and page view) you can create, delete, view details for, and edit a wiki page. You must be in the page view to rename a wiki page.

> **Note:** See [Customizing a site](../tasks/site-customize.md) for how to switch the wiki on and off for a site.

## Accessing the wiki

Access the wiki to view the wiki content related to the current site. In the wiki you can create, delete, rename, and edit the wiki pages. You can perform most actions from both the wiki list and the page view.

1. In a site click **More** then **Wiki**.

    > **Note:** In each site the feature names can be customized. If the site manager has done this, the link might have a name other than **Wiki**.

    This opens the wiki which displays the main wiki page for this site. When viewing a wiki page the actions you can perform appear as buttons (**New Page**, **Delete**, **Rename**) and as links at the top right of the content area (**View Page**, **Edit Page**, **Details**).

2. Click **Wiki Page List** to display the wiki list.

    The wiki list displays a summary of all pages in the wiki for the current site. In this view, the actions you can perform on a wiki page appear as buttons beneath the banner (only **New Page** is available in this view) and as links to the right of each page summary. You can perform most actions from both the wiki list and the page view.

    > **Note:** You can click **Main Page** to return to the previous view.

## Browsing the wiki pages

The browsing feature in the wiki lets you filter the wiki pages so you can easily locate specific content.

The wiki page list displays all wiki pages in the current site organized chronologically. The most recent page appears at the top of the list.

The browsing pane on the left side of the page lets you display a subset of the wiki content by selecting a specific view or a tag. Whether you are browsing by view or tag, the wiki list displays a summary of the pages matching the selected option. The summary includes:

    * the wiki page name
    * the user who created the page
    * the date and time the page was created
    * the user who last modified the page
    * the date and time the page was last modified
    * a sample of the content
    * the tags associated with the page

The **Pages** list in the browsing pane provides the following views:

**Recently Modified**
:Displays the pages modified in the past seven days
**All**
:Displays all pages created in the wiki for the current site
**Recently Added**
:Displays the pages created in the past seven days
**My Pages**
:Displays the pages created by the currently signed in user

The **Tags** list displays the tags currently associated with one or more wiki pages. The number following the tag tells you how many wiki pages are associated with the tag.
