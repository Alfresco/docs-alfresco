title: The Document Library
---

Access the site Document Library to view and work with the content in the current site.

1. In a site click **Document Library** to access the library.

    > **Note:** In each site the component names can be customized. If the site manager has done this, the link in the navigation bar might have a label other than **Document Library**.

    The item list takes up most of the library main page. You can filter the item list and navigate the library using the explorer panel on the left side of the page.

2. By default items are shown in the **Detailed View**. Click **Options** to select a different view, see [Library Options](#libraryviewoptions) for more details.

    > **Note:** In the **Options** menu you can also show and hide folders, switch to fullscreen view, and set up an RSS feed.

3. Use the sort menu at the top of the list to change the criteria used to sort the items and click the ![Sort icon]({% link content-services/images/sort-icon.png %}) icon to toggle between ascending and descending sort order.

    > **Note:** The view options you select (library view, sort order, hide/show folder selection) are specific to your user account. These settings are carried over from the current site to all other sites that you view. They are saved between sessions and remain the preferred view until you change it.

4. In the list views position your cursor over a piece of content item to display the available actions. This also displays the version number, which is set to 1.0 when a new item is uploaded to the library.

    > **Note:** If you're using a Mac then it might seem that not all of the actions are available. This is because with a Mac sometimes the scrollbars are hidden. To display the scrollbars go **System Preferences > General** and select to always show scroll bars.

    In the other views, click the ![Information icon]({% link content-services/images/ico-information.png %}) information button for an item to display the item details, version, actions, and social features.

## Exploring the library

You can filter which items you see in the library using the explorer panel on the left side of the library. 
This can help you to locate specific items in the library.

The **Documents** list in the explorer panel provides the following views:

* **All Documents**

    Displays all files in the library

* **I'm Editing**

    Displays the files you currently have checked out

* **Others are Editing**

    Displays the files checked out by other site members

* **Recently Modified**

    Displays files modified in the past seven days

* **Recently Added**

    Displays files added to the library in the past seven days

* **My Favorites**

    Displays the files you have marked as favorites

The **Library** section displays the folder structure in a tree view. The symbol ![Subfolders]({% link content-services/images/Subfolders.png %}) 
indicates a library folder contains subfolders. Click on a folder to expand or collapse it.

The **Categories** tree lets you filter the library contents by category. Click a category to expand the branch; 
click it again to collapse it.

The **Tags** list displays the tags currently associated with one or more files. The number following the tag tells you 
how many files have that tag.

> **Note:** When you filter content using **Tags** view, items have additional **Locate File** and **Locate Folder** actions to show the actual location of content in the library tree.

The breadcrumb path above the file list displays your current position in the tree. Each breadcrumb item is a link so 
you can easily return to any part of the current navigation path. You can:

* Click a link to return to the corresponding folder.
* Click ![Navigate Up]({% link content-services/images/navigate-up-icon.png %}) to display the contents of the folder one level higher.
* Click **Options** then **Hide Breadcrumb** / **Show Breadcrumb** to hide/show the breadcrumb path.

For each piece of content (folders and files) you view in the**Document Library** you can:

* Click the name of an file to display the file preview screen for that files.
* Click the name of a folder to view its contents. You can see your current location in the breadcrumb path.

## Library view options {#libraryviewoptions}

The **Options** menu in the **Document Library** lets you customize how you view content.

The default view for the library is **Detailed View**. This view displays the basic details for each file or folder as 
well as a thumbnail, description, tags, and social features (Favorite, Like, Comment, and Share). **Simple View** just 
displays the basic details..

You can use the other view options to get a more visual representation of site content, or to view content in a more 
basic table format.

At the bottom of the **Options** menu you can click to **Set** or **Remove** the current view as the default view for 
the folder you're in.

In all viewing options, just click an file name to open the file preview screen. Click a folder name to open that folder 
so you can view its contents.

With **Media View** and **Audio View** you'll see extra file information.

If you select one of the more visually rich views, the way you interact with content changes slightly. Here are some 
useful features you'll find in these views.

* **Resize the thumbnails**

    ![Size slider]({% link content-services/images/GV-slider.png %})

    Use the resizing bar to make the thumbnails larger and smaller. This lets you choose how much detail you see in the main view so you can either quickly scan many smaller images or preview larger ones without needing to view the details page.

* **Display the information panel**

    Click the ![Information icon]({% link content-services/images/ico-information.png %}) Information icon to display content details and available actions.

* **Select content**

    Click the check box on an item or folder to select it. In **Gallery View** you can select multiple items, in **Filmstrip View** just one.

In the **Options** menu you can also show and hide folders or the breadcrumb trail, switch to full screen or full window view

You can even set up an **RSS Feed** for the folder, see [Subscribing to an RSS feed]({% link content-services/latest/using/share/index.md %}#subtorssfeed).
