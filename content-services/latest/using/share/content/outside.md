title: Working with files outside the library
---

While the Document Library is the focal point for working with content in Alfresco Share, there are also a few other areas available to you.

Each of these areas can be accessed wherever you are in Share, from the links at the top of the screen.

The **My Files** and **Shared Files** areas are locations with Share, whereas the **Repository** is an overview of everything in your Content Services system.

* **My Files**: This is an area that only you can access. No-one else can see the files here and every user has their own, unique **My Files** area. It's great for saving draft content to, removing the need for trying to remember where you saved it on your laptop, or was it saved to your mobile...
* **Shared Files**: This area can be accessed by everyone in your organization. It's a great way to quickly share files with other users that's not ready to be uploaded to a site yet.
* **Repository**: The area lets you view all Content Services content you have access to - all the sites, all the system files, everything is available here. You can work just as you would in a site Document Library but here you have a higher view of everything that's available. It's also very handy for Alfresco administrators who want to work with system files.

## My Files

**My Files** is a unique area in Alfresco Share where you can create and store content, and no other users can access it.

So rather than saving content on your laptop or tablet, you can save it in Share and still keep it private until it's ready to be shared.

You can access the **My Files** area from anywhere in Share by clicking **My Files** at the top of the screen.

The functionality available in the **My Files** area is identical to what you find in the Document Library, see [Working with content in a library]({% link content-services/latest/using/share/content/add.md %}) for details.

## Shared Files

**Shared Files** is a unique area in Alfresco Share where you can create, store and share content, without adding it to a site Document Library.

Any content that you create or add to **Shared Files** is visible to all other users in your organization. It is in effect a shared drive, so you can quickly share content with colleagues without uploading it to a site, emailing it, or needing to find a pen drive.

You can access the **Shared Files** area from anywhere in Share by clicking **Shared Files** at the top of the screen.

The functionality available in the **Shared Files** area is identical to what you find in the Document Library, see [Working with content in a library]({% link content-services/latest/using/share/content/add.md %}) for details.

## Repository

The **Repository** displays all the Content Services content that you have access to, including content of all sites that you're a member of.

> **Note:** If the **Repository** isn't available on the toolbar, contact your system administrator.

The **Repository** includes all of the usual document library functionality with the exception of the **Edit Offline** action and the ability to create Google Docs content.

Just as in a document library, the explorer panel includes navigation and filtering options. This lets you filter the repository contents by category or tag, or you can browse the repository file structure. You can also choose to view the content items currently checked out to you (**I'm Editing** view) or those that you've specifically flagged as favorites (**My Favorites** view).

The functionality available within the Repository library is identical to what you find in a site library. See [Working with content in a library]({% link content-services/latest/using/share/content/add.md %}) for details on performing specific actions within the **Repository**.
