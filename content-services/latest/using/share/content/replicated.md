title: Working with replicated content
---

Content Services administrators can configure Content Services systems so that content is replicated across multiple 
repositories. Files and folders created as the result of a replication job display the 
**Transferred from another Repository** icon in the file list.

This icon indicates that this is replicated, not original, content. Depending on the transfer configuration, 
the content can be read-only.

Content marked with this icon also displays the action **View in Source Repository**. Select this action to display 
the file preview screen for the related *original* content file or folder.
