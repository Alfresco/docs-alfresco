title: Alfresco Query Accelerator 
---

The Query Accelerator is a mechanism for optimising selected queries in very large content repositories. We would
suggest using this feature to support large transactional deployments with hundreds of millions of nodes, where
documents are automatically imported from other systems, rather than traditional collaborative content management
system where humans are creating documents. In transactional deployments there typically is a case id and one or two
other properties, which identify a related collection of documents.

An administrator may define a combination of properties and aspects as a `query set`, to support a faster alternative to
Transactional Metadata Query (TMDQ) or Solr. Properties may be from multiple types or aspects. A single query set can
speed up more than one query if the queries share common search properties or aspects. A number of different query sets
may be created to support queries with different search properties or aspects.

This performance comes at the cost of additional space for denormalized databases tables and indexes as well as a minimal increased time on ingestion and update. This will however allow customers to make that decision. Having many properties in a query set or having lots of query sets should be avoided, as the cost will be high and generally indicates that
there is something wrong with the data model design.

## Operational overview

1. Query sets may be applied to an existing Alfresco repository. For example a query set could be applied to a system
which has been upgraded to 7.0.0 that already contains hundreds of millions of documents.

2. Multiple (zero or more but typically not more than 10) query sets may be defined. Each will have its own name. It will
be possible to replace a query set with a new version or to remove it completely. The definition can include the
properties or aspects applied to nodes and if necessary (for selected databases) the order of columns
in compound indexes. Query sets are defined using JSON files.

3. Administrators perform a query set refresh in the Admin Console. The addition of new query sets, 
the replacement of an existing query set or complete removal does not require a restart, an outage or have a major impact on normal operations. The `alfresco.log` will contain messages to reflect progress. When a new query set is identified, the system will start populating a denormalized 
table in the background. It will also abandon the table population before it is complete, if a new 
version of the query set is created. The implementation will also need to identify a query 
set or if a previous version is no longer needed and issue a message to the `alfresco.log` to advise that the query set 
can be deleted.

4. Once a denormalized table has been created and fully populated, it will automatically start being used.

5. The Query Accelerator will provide ATOMIC (transactionally consistent) results.

6. The Query Accelerator is only an enterprise edition feature.

## Install properties

* Enable the Query Accelerator by setting the property `queryAccelerator.enabled` to `true`.
* Define the location of the Query Accelerator config files by setting the property `queryAccelerator.config.dir`.
* The size of each population batch.

### Properties example

```bash
queryAccelerator.enabled=true
queryAccelerator.config.dir=shared/classes/alfresco/extension/querysets
queryAccelerator.populator.workerBatchSize=5000
```

If you are using Docker Compose in development, you will need to copy
your query set definition into your running ACS repository container.
One way is to use the following command:

```bash
docker cp custom_queryset.json <alfresco container>:/usr/local/tomcat/shared/classes/alfresco/extension/querysets/
```

In a Kubernetes environment, [ConfigMaps](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-pod-configmap/){:target="_blank"}
can be used to add query set definitions. You will need to create
a ConfigMap from the JSON file and mount the ConfigMap through a volume
to the ACS repository pods.

```bash
kubectl create configmap custom-queryset-config --from-file=name_of_a_file.json
```

The necessary volumes are already provided out of the box and the files
in ConfigMap `custom-queryset-config` will be mounted to
`/usr/local/tomcat/shared/classes/alfresco/extension/querysets/`.

> **Caution:** 
> From Kubernetes documentation: If there are some files in the mountPath location, they will be deleted.

## Configuration

Use the following information to configure Query Accelerator. 
The query set configurations define the denormalized tables that will be created to support faster queries.

| Attribute        | Description |
| ---------------- | ----------- |
| version          | The version of the query set. |
| name             | The table name. The actual database table name will have a prefix of 'alf_qs_' and a suffix of '_v' plus the version. So for a query set called of 'test1' and a version of 1 that actual database table name would be 'alf_qs_test1_v1'. |
| properties       | A collection of properties to appear on the denormalized table. A property consists of a name attribute which is the name of a property and an isIndex attribute which indicates that the related column on the table should be indexed. |
| aspects          | A collection of aspects to appear on the denormalized table. The table will have a boolean column for each of the aspects to indicate if the node has those aspects applied. An aspect consists of a name attribute which is the name of an aspect and an isIndex attribute which indicates that the related column on the table should be indexed. |
| compositeIndexes | A collection of composite indexes to be created for the table. A composite index consists of an attribute where the attribute name is the index name and the attribute value is a collection of names of properties and/or aspects of the query set. |

* The maximum length of the query set name and the version is the maximum table name length of the database system being used,
  minus 9. So for Postgres, which has a maximum table name length of 63 bytes, the maximum name and version length in
  the query set is 54 bytes.
* Queries that include negations on aspects should not be accelerated.
* Properties of type MLTEXT are NOT supported. If included a WARN message will be logged,
  the properties will be ignored, and the corresponding denormalized table will be created without them.
* The denormalized table will have an alf_type column, holding the name of the content type.
* When aspects are used, the denormalized table will contain only the nodes that have at least one of the aspect.
  It is for this reason that a query checking for the absence of an aspect will not use the query accelerator
  and will be performed by the standard engine.
* Auditable properties (namely: cm:creator, cm:created, cm:modifier, cm:modified and cm:accessed) defined in the configuration
  will be ignored. Data of this nature is always available and there is no need to store it on the corresponding denormalised
  table.
* Properties of the following types defined in the configuration will be ignored. If included a WARN message will be logged, as the properties are already included in the denormalized table:
  + cm:owner
  + cm:noderef
  + sys:node-dbid
  + sys:node-uuid
* When files are read from the `queryAccelerator.config.dir` directory they are read in
  alphanumeric order. So _0101-coyote.json_ would be read before _0102-coyote.json_ and it is
  read before _0201-acme.json_.

## Query set configuration examples

### Example 1

This first example is intentionally simple but should work on any system, providing a basic understanding of how the system works.

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "name": "Test01",
  "properties": [
    {
      "name": "cm:name",
      "isIndex": true
    },
    {
      "name": "cm:author",
      "isIndex": true
    }
  ],
  "aspects": [
    {
      "name": "cm:titled",
      "isIndex": true
    }
  ],
  "compositeIndexes": {
    "index_1": ["cm:name", "cm:author"],
    "index_2": ["cm:name", "cm:titled"]
  }
}
```

ACS node properties:
![acs-node-properties]({% link content-services/images/acs-properties.png %})
Table entry:

| node_id | owner_id | alf_type | cm_name   | cm_author   | cm_titled |
| ------- | -------- | -------- | --------- | ----------- | --------- |
| 887     | 3        | 24       | demo1.txt | Joe Bloggs  | true      |

### Example 2

The following example requires that at least one node in the system has the DublinCore aspect applied. This aspect is
part of the system by default. If there are no nodes, an unknown property error is reported.

```json
{
  "version": 6,
  "name": "ac",
  "properties": [
    {
      "name": "cm:name",
      "isIndex": true
    },
    {
      "name": "cm:publisher",
      "isIndex": true
    }
  ],
  "aspects": [
    {
      "name": "cm:titled",
      "isIndex": true
    },
    {
      "name": "cm:dublincore",
      "isIndex": true
    }
  ],
  "compositeIndexes": {
    "index_1": ["cm:name", "cm:publisher"],
    "index_2": ["cm:name", "cm:titled"]
  }
}
```

ACS node properties and aspects:
![acs-node-aspects]({% link content-services/images/acs-aspects.png %})
Table entry:

| node_id | owner_id | alf_type | cm_name   | cm_publisher | cm_titled | cm_dublincore |
| ------- | -------- | -------- | --------- | ------------ | --------- | ------------- |
| 918     | 3        | 24       | demo2     | Egmont       | true      | true          |

## Query sets and TMDQ queries

Here we give an example of how to create a query set to replace a TMDQ.

The following TMDQ selects all documents (cm:content) which have a dublincore aspect (cm:dublincore), a
publisher (cm:publisher) equal to 'Hachette Livre' and a type (cm:type) equal to 'Action'.

```
{
   "query":{
      "query":"select * from cmis:document as d join cm:dublincore as dc on d.cmis:objectId = dc.cmis:objectId where dc.cm:publisher = 'Hachette Livre' and dc.cm:type='Action'",
      "language":"cmis"
   }
}
```
The following Query Set would be able to support the above TMDQ. It also requires that at least one node in the system
has the DublinCore aspect applied.

```json
{
  "version": "1",
  "name": "doc_dublincore",
  "properties": [
    {
      "name": "cm:publisher",
      "isIndex": true
    },
    {
      "name": "cm:type",
      "isIndex": true
    }
  ],
  "aspects": [
    {
      "name": "cm:dublincore",
      "isIndex": true
    }
  ]
}
```

## Query set status and caching

Denormalized tables have a status. For example:

| Name | Version | State | Notes |
| ---- | ------- | ----- | ----- |
| tableA | 1 | OBSOLETE | Should be removed |
| tableA | 2 |  RETIRED | Can be removed |
| tableA | 3 |  LIVE | Currently being used |
| tableA | 4 |  INPROGRESS | Created but not fully populated yet, so cannot be used |
| tableA | 5 |  NEW | Seen but population of denormalized data has not started |

The transition from NEW to INPROGRESS will normally happen almost immediately.

## Logging

The Admin Console currently only indicates if updates were detected. For a more complete picture of the query sets configuration DEBUG logging must be used:

```bash
logger.alfresco-enterprise-repo-queryaccelerator.name=org.alfresco.enterprise.repo.queryaccelerator
logger.alfresco-enterprise-repo-queryaccelerator.level=debug
```

Logs when a Query Set Refresh was performed but there are no updates:

```

It is also possible to obtain detailed logs for the query engine. The logs provide information about the process 
of selecting the query set, based on the query, by activating the DEBUG level, as in this example:

```bash
logger.alfresco-repo-search-impl-querymodel-impl-db.name=org.alfresco.repo.search.impl.querymodel.impl.db
logger.alfresco-repo-search-impl-querymodel-impl-db.level=debug
```

```

### Removing a query set

You can remove a query set by performing its removal in the Admin Console. There is no need to perform
 a refresh after the query set removal, however the JSON config file should be manually removed from the config directory.

During the refresh the JSON config files will be compared against the internal registry of query sets. If a query set in
the registry does not have a corresponding JSON config file with the same tableName then a warning will be logged.
The denormalized database table will NOT be dropped. 

### Updating a query set

You can update/replace a query set by changing the properties, aspects and compositeIndexes in the query set JSON config.

You then need to update the version in the query set JSON config and then perform a query set refresh in the Admin Console.

This will start a process that will replace the previous version of the query set.
* A new version of the query set will be added to the internal query set registry.
* A new version of the denormalized table will be created.
* The denormalized table for the previous version will continue in-use until it has been replaced by the new version.
* The new version of the denormalized table will be populated. This could take a considerable time depending on the scale 
of the Alfresco installation.
* When the population is completed
    * the query set will be flagged as live
    * the previous version of the query set will be flagged as retired
    * the denormalized table for the previous version can now be dropped manually via the Remove Query Set button in the
    Admin Console 

 > **Important:** If you edit a query set config and change the name and request a query set refresh, the system will see this as the retirement of the original query set and the creation of a new one.

### Query Set Refresh in Admin Console

The query sets can be refreshed in the Admin Console.

1. Select **Query Accelerator** in the left hand menu.

    ![Admin Console]({% link content-services/images/admin-console-menu.png %})

2. Press the **Refresh Query Set** button.

    ![Refresh Query Set]({% link content-services/images/refresh-query-set.png %})

If there are updates to the query sets in the folder defined by `queryAccelerator.config.dir` (normally
`shared/classes/alfresco/extension/querysets`) you will see:

![Refresh Started]({% link content-services/images/refresh-query-set-started.png %})

If there are no updates to the query sets you will see:

![Refresh Not Started Set]({% link content-services/images/refresh-query-set-not-started.png %})

### Query Set Remove in Admin Console

The query sets can be removed in the Admin Console.

1. On the **Query Accelerator** page, complete the query set name and version text fields.

    ![Remove Query Set]({% link content-services/images/remove-query-set.png %})

2. Press the **Remove Query Set** button.

If the query set is successfully removed you will see:

![Refresh Query Set]({% link content-services/images/refresh-query-set.png %})

If no matching query set was found you will see:

![RefQuery Set Note Removed]({% link content-services/images/query-set-not-removed.png %})
