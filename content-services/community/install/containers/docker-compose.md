title: Install using Docker Compose
---

Use this information to quickly start up Community Edition using Docker Compose.

> **Note:** While Docker Compose is often used for production deployments, the Docker Compose file provided is recommended for development and test environments only. Customers are expected to adapt this file to their own requirements, if they intend to use Docker Compose to deploy a production environment.

To deploy Community Edition using Docker Compose, download and install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/){:target="_blank"}, then follow the steps below. Make sure that you've reviewed the [prerequisites]({% link content-services/community/install/containers/index.md %}#prerequisites) before continuing.

1. Clone the project locally, and change directory to the project's `docker-compose` folder:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Alfresco/acs-deployment.git
    cd acs-deployment/docker-compose
    ```

    > **Note:** Make sure that exposed ports are open on your host computer. Check the `docker-compose.yml` file to determine the exposed ports - refer to the `host:container` port definitions. You'll see they include 5432, 8080, 8083 and others.

2. Deploy Community Edition, including the repository, Share, Postgres database, Search Services, etc.:

    ```bash
    docker-compose -f community-docker-compose.yml up
    ```

    This downloads the images, fetches all the dependencies, creates each container, and then starts the system:

    ```text
    ...
    ⠿ Network docker-compose_default                 Created    ...
    ⠿ Container docker-compose_transform-core-aio_1  Created    ...
    ⠿ Container docker-compose_activemq_1            Created    ...
    ⠿ Container docker-compose_alfresco_1            Created    ...
    ⠿ Container docker-compose_postgres_1            Created    ...
    ⠿ Container docker-compose_share_1               Created    ...
    ⠿ Container docker-compose_solr6_1               Created    ...
    ⠿ Container docker-compose_proxy_1               Created    ...
    Attaching to activemq_1, alfresco_1, postgres_1, proxy_1, share_1, solr6_1, transform-core-aio_1
    ...
    ```

    Note that the name of each container begins with the folder name you created in step 2.

    As an alternative, you can also start the containers in the background by running `docker-compose up -d`.

3. Wait for the logs to complete, showing messages:

    ```bash
    ...
    alfresco_1 | 2021-10-04 13:57:50,740  INFO  ... Starting 'Transformers' subsystem, ID: [Transformers, default]
    alfresco_1 | 2021-10-04 13:57:50,935  INFO  ... Startup of 'Transformers' subsystem, ID: [Transformers, default] complete
    ...
    ```

    See [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) if you encounter errors whilst the system is starting up.

4. Open your browser and check everything starts up correctly:

    | Service | Endpoint |
    | ------- | -------- |
    | Administration and REST APIs | `http://localhost:8080/alfresco` |
    | Share | `http://localhost:8080/share` |
    | Search Services administration | `http://localhost:8083/solr` |

    If Docker is running on your local machine, the IP address will be just `localhost`.

    If you're using the [Docker Toolbox](https://docs.docker.com/toolbox/toolbox_install_windows/){:target="_blank"}, run the following command to find the IP address:

    ```bash
    docker-machine ip
    ```

5. Log in as the `admin` user. Enter the default administrator password `admin`.

## Check system start up

Use this information to verify that the system started correctly, and to clean up the deployment.

1. Open a new terminal window.

2. Change directory to the `docker-compose` folder that you created in the deployment steps.

3. Verify that all the services started correctly.

    1. List the images and additional details:

        ```bash
        docker-compose images
        ```

        You should see a list of the services defined in your `docker-compose.yaml` file:

        ```text
        Container                             Repository                                       Tag             Image Id        Size  
        -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
        docker-compose_activemq_1             alfresco/alfresco-activemq                       5.16.1           e9dd27ce1a5d   706.3 MB
        docker-compose_alfresco_1             alfresco/alfresco-content-repository-community   7.2.0            eed53a3099ea   1.201 GB
        docker-compose_postgres_1             postgres                                         13.3             b2fcd079c1d4   314.7 MB
        docker-compose_proxy_1                alfresco/alfresco-acs-nginx                      3.2.0            da6d34dd9386   21.86 MB
        docker-compose_share_1                alfresco/alfresco-share                          7.2.0            8f7aa246f5fe   725.7 MB
        docker-compose_solr6_1                alfresco/alfresco-search-services                2.0.3            4f6f7c71c901   462.1 MB
        docker-compose_transform-core-aio_1   alfresco/alfresco-transform-core-aio             2.5.7            bba1b5d18513   1.696 GB
        ```

    2. List the running containers:

        ```bash
        docker-compose ps
        ```

        You should see a list of the services defined in the `docker-compose.yaml` file.

    3. View the log files for each service `<service-name>`, or container `<container-name>`:

        ```bash
        docker-compose logs <service-name>
        docker container logs <container-name>
        ```

        For example, to check the logs for Share, run any of the following commands:

        ```bash
        docker-compose logs share
        docker container logs docker-compose_share_1
        ```

        You can add an optional parameter `--tail=25` before `<container-name>` to display the last 25 lines of the logs for the selected container.

        ```bash
        docker-compose logs --tail=25 share
        docker container logs --tail=25 docker-compose_share_1
        ```

        Check for a success message:

        ```text
        Successfully retrieved license information from Alfresco.
        ```

    Once you've tested the services, you can clean up the deployment by stopping the running services.

4. Stop the session by using `CONTROL+C` in the same window as the running services:

    ```text
    ^CGracefully stopping... (press Ctrl+C again to force)
     ⠿ Container docker-compose_proxy_1               Stopped    ...
     ⠿ Container docker-compose_postgres_1            Stopped    ...
     ⠿ Container docker-compose_activemq_1            Stopped    ...
     ⠿ Container docker-compose_transform-core-aio_1  Stopped    ...
     ⠿ Container docker-compose_share_1               Stopped    ...
     ⠿ Container docker-compose_solr6_1               Stopped    ...
     ⠿ Container docker-compose_alfresco_1            Stopped    ...
    ```

5. Alternatively, you can open a new terminal window, change directory to the `docker-compose` folder, and run:

    ```bash
    docker-compose down
    ```

    This stops the running services, as shown in the previous example, and removes them from memory:

    ```text
    ⠿ Container docker-compose_solr6_1               Removed    ...
    ⠿ Container docker-compose_transform-core-aio_1  Removed    ...
    ⠿ Container docker-compose_postgres_1            Removed    ...
    ⠿ Container docker-compose_proxy_1               Removed    ...
    ⠿ Container docker-compose_activemq_1            Removed    ...
    ⠿ Container docker-compose_share_1               Removed    ...
    ⠿ Container docker-compose_alfresco_1            Removed    ...
    ⠿ Network docker-compose_default                 Removed    ...
    ```

6. You can use a few more commands to explore the services when they're running. Change directory to `docker-compose` before running these:

    1. Stop all the running containers:

        ```bash
        docker-compose stop
        ```

    2. Restart the containers (after using the `stop` command):

        ```bash
        docker-compose restart
        ```

    3. Starts the containers that were started with `docker-compose up`:

        ```bash
        docker-compose start
        ```

    4. Stop all running containers, and remove them and the network:

        ```bash
        docker-compose down --rmi all
        ```

        The `--rmi all` option also removes the images created by `docker-compose up`, and the images used by any service. You can use this, for example, if any containers fail and you need to remove them:

        ```text
        Stopping docker-compose_proxy_1              ... done
        Stopping docker-compose_solr6_1              ... done
        Stopping docker-compose_postgres_1           ... done
        Stopping docker-compose_share_1              ... done
        Stopping docker-compose_activemq_1           ... done
        Stopping docker-compose_transform-core-aio_1 ... done
        Stopping docker-compose_alfresco_1           ... done
        Removing docker-compose_proxy_1              ... done
        Removing docker-compose_solr6_1              ... done
        Removing docker-compose_postgres_1           ... done
        Removing docker-compose_share_1              ... done
        Removing docker-compose_activemq_1           ... done
        Removing docker-compose_transform-core-aio_1 ... done
        Removing docker-compose_alfresco_1           ... done
        Removing network docker-compose_default
        Removing image alfresco/alfresco-content-repository-community:7.2.0
        Removing image alfresco/alfresco-transform-core-aio:2.5.7
        Removing image alfresco/alfresco-share:7.2.0
        Removing image postgres:13.3
        Removing image alfresco/alfresco-search-services:2.0.3
        Removing image alfresco/alfresco-activemq:5.16.1
        Removing image alfresco/alfresco-acs-nginx:3.2.0
        ```

See the [Docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/){:target="_blank"} for more on using Docker.

### Deployment project in GitHub

See the [Alfresco/acs-deployment](https://github.com/Alfresco/acs-deployment){:target="_blank"} GitHub project for more details.

* In this project, you’ll find several Docker Compose files. The default `docker-compose.yml` file contains the latest work-in-progress deployment scripts, and installs the latest *development* version of Content Services.
* To deploy a specific released version of Content Services, several *major.minor* Docker Compose files are provided in the `docker-compose` folder of the project.
* To modify your development environment, for example to change or mount files in the existing images, you’ll have to create new custom Docker images (recommended approach). The same approach applies if you want to install AMP files into the repository and Share images. See the [Customization guidelines](https://github.com/Alfresco/acs-deployment/blob/master/docs/docker-compose/examples/customisation-guidelines.md){:target="_blank"} for more.

Using the Community Compose file in this project deploys the following system:

![Docker Compose - Community]({% link content-services/images/compose-community.png %}){:width="460" height="380px"}

## Cleanup

To bring the system down and cleanup the containers run the following command:

```bash
docker-compose down
```

## Troubleshooting

1. If you have issues running `docker-compose up` after deleting a previous Docker Compose cluster, try replacing step 2 in the initial Docker Compose instructions with:

    ```bash
    docker-compose down && docker-compose build --no-cache && docker-compose -f community-docker-compose.yml up
    ```

    > **Note:** Make sure that the `docker-compose up` part of the command uses the format you chose in step 2.

2. Stop the session by using `CONTROL+C`.

3. Remove the containers (using the `--rmi all` option):

    ```bash
    docker-compose down --rmi all
    ```

4. Try allocating more memory resources, as advised in `docker-compose.yml`.

    For example, in Docker, change the memory setting in **Preferences** (or **Settings**) **Resources** > **Advanced** > **Memory** to at least 8GB. Make sure you restart Docker and wait for the process to finish before continuing.

    Go back to step 2 in the initial Docker Compose instructions to start the deployment again.

> **Note:** You'll need a machine with at least 13GB of memory to distribute among the Docker containers.
