title: Install overview

This information helps you to install Community Edition, additional software, and modules. You have two main options for installing Community Edition:

* using the distribution zip
* using containerized deployment

You can install Community Edition using standard WAR files, contained in the distribution zip, to deploy in a production environment.

You can also install Community Edition using Docker images that are packaged in Helm charts (as a deployment template for your specific deployment needs), or Docker Compose (for test and development environments only); there is no GUI installer.

> **Important:** The deployment of Community Edition on AWS, such as Amazon EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service), is only recommended for customers with a good knowledge of Community Edition, and strong competencies in AWS and containerized deployment.
