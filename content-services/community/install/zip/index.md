This page describes how to manually install Community Edition using the distribution zip.

For a description of the system paths used within this documentation, see [System path conventions]({% link content-services/community/admin/index.md %}#system-paths-convention).

## Prerequisites

To install Community Edition using the distribution zip (which also contains the WAR files), make sure that the required software is available on your system:

* Java: OpenJDK 17 is required
* Application server: Apache Tomcat
* Database: PostgreSQL, MySQL or MariaDB
* Message broker: ActiveMQ
* LibreOffice
* ImageMagick

## Install overview

Use this section to get an overview of the main stages for installing Community Edition using the distribution zip. It's designed for users who just need a simple checklist to follow.

Only the main stages for setting up and configuring Community Edition are summarized. These include preparing your system for installation, installing the application, configuring it based on your requirements, and finally, testing and getting familiar with Community Edition.

Before you start, validate that you have access to the prerequisite software so you can install them in the right order. This includes a JRE, a supported database, Tomcat application server, a message broker (i.e. ActiveMQ), Alfresco Search Services, and additional components (such as ImageMagick).

> **Note:** ActiveMQ is required when manually installing Community Edition 201911 GA onwards. For more information on installing and configuring ActiveMQ, see [Configuring ActiveMQ]({% link content-services/community/config/activemq.md %}).

To get started, prepare your production server by installing the prerequisite software (JRE, database, and message broker) before continuing.

1. Download the distribution zip file by accessing the Alfresco Community Edition download page.
2. Generate certificates for mutual TLS.
3. Download Tomcat and review the installation steps required.
4. Set up Tomcat.
5. Install and configure Community Edition.
6. Install any Alfresco Module Packages (AMPs) such as Alfresco Share, Google Docs Integration, and Alfresco Office Services.
7. Set up ActiveMQ.
8. Install third-party software used by Community Edition. This includes LibreOffice, ImageMagick, and Alfresco PDF Renderer.

> **Note:** Starting from Content Services 7.0, the `alfresco-pdf-renderer` binaries are no longer included in the distribution zip. LibreOffice, ImageMagick, and Alfresco PDF Renderer are no longer part of the Content Services zip installation.
>
> * You must install LibreOffice, ImageMagick, and Alfresco PDF Renderer with the Transform Service for transformations to be fully functional.
> * For non-containerized deployment, you are also required to install Exiftool. Exiftool will be utilized by the TIKAAuto metadata extraction parser.
> * Community users can utilize [alfresco-transform-core-aio](https://github.com/Alfresco/alfresco-transform-core/tree/master/alfresco-transform-core-aio/alfresco-transform-core-aio-boot){:target="_blank"} Spring Boot app for installing transformation services.

Review and test your setup to check that all the installation steps are complete:

1. Start and configure your database.
2. Start and configure ActiveMQ.
3. Start the repository.

## What you need to install Community Edition

There are a number of different installation files available to you, each of which you can choose depending on what's already installed on your system.

For new installations or upgrades, use the distribution zip. Use the Alfresco WAR file to install Community Edition within an existing Tomcat. The WAR file is included in the distribution zip. In addition, you must install all the required additional components manually.

The installation files are available from the [Alfresco Community Edition download page](https://www.hyland.com/en/resources/alfresco-community-download){:target="_blank"}.

Here's a list of the files to download and install.

| File | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| alfresco-content-services-community-distribution-23.2.x.zip | Community Edition distribution zip for new installations or upgrades. Alfresco WAR files (in distribution zip) for a manual install into an existing Tomcat application server. This distribution zip also contains the Module Management Tool (MMT) and the sample extension files, such as `alfresco-global.properties`. |
|alfresco-search-services-2.0.x.zip | Alfresco Search Services distribution zip.<br><br>See [Install Alfresco Search Services]({% link search-services/latest/install/index.md %}) for more information. |

## Preparing the filesystem and database

These steps describe how to prepare a suitable location for data storage and the database.

1. Create a new folder on your local filesystem.

    This folder can be located anywhere, but you need to make sure that the user account under which Tomcat will run has full read/write access to this location.

2. Create a new database for Community Edition.

    It's good security practice to create a new user account for Community Edition which only has permissions to this database.

    For PostgreSQL, run the following commands:

    ```sql
    create database alfresco encoding 'utf8';
    create role alfresco LOGIN password 'alfresco';
    grant all on database alfresco to alfresco;
    ```
