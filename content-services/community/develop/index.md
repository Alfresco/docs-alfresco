title: Getting started in developing

Developing for **Alfresco Content Services - Community Edition** is the same as developing for **Alfresco Content Services - 
Enterprise Edition**. For an introduction, and access to the developer documentation, see [this section]({% link content-services/latest/develop/index.md %}) 
of the Enterprise documentation.

>**Note:** You should be aware that some features are not available when using the Community Edition as they are paid for 
> extensions, such as the Alfresco Content Connector for AWS S3. This means that some APIs, such as the Storage Properties 
> ReST API, are not useful when you run the Community Edition. It might also be pointed out directly in the documentation 
> that a feature is *Enterprise only*.
