### Configuring the RSS feed dashlets

There are two RSS feed dashlets that you can include on your personal and site dashboards: RSS Feed and Alfresco Add-ons RSS Feed. On both dashlets you can edit the default URL to display any RSS feed.

1. Click the **Configure** icon on the dashlet title.

2. Specify the feed you want to subscribe to.

3. Select the number of feed items you want to display.

4. Select **Open links in new window** to have the target story display in a new window.

5. Click **OK**.

### Setting up the Web View dashlet

Set up the Web View dashlet to display websites.

> **Note:** Some websites have restrictions that stop you from displaying them.

The dashboard must be customized to display the Web View dashlet.

1. On the Web View dashlet, click the **Configure** icon.

2. In the **Link Title** field, type the text you want to appear in the dashlet header.

    If you don't specify a title the dashlet header displays the URL of the website you specify.

3. In the **URL** field, type the website address.

    > **Note:** Ensure the URL entered does not contain the JavaScript code `if(self.parent.frames.length!=0)self.parent.location=document.location;`. This or similar code causes the referenced website to open directly in the browser rather than in the Web View dashlet. This will lead to problems viewing the current dashboard (personal or site).

4. Click **OK**.

### Configuring the Saved Search dashlet

Configure the Saved Search dashlet to run a specific search each time the dashboard is loaded.

On the site dashboard, only a site manager can configure the Saved Search dashlet.

1. Navigate to your personal dashboard or enter a site.

2. On the Saved Search dashlet, click the ![Configure]({% link content-services/images/ico-configure.png %}) configure icon.

    The Enter Search Term dialog box opens.

3. Type the search criteria.

    **Note:** Entering ban will search only for the word *ban*; it will not return results for *banana*. To return matches for a partial word, use a wildcard in your search criteria (example: ban*).

4. Enter a title for the dashlet that represents the results that will be returned.

5. Select the number of results you want to display.

6. Click **OK**.

## Viewing your user profile

Your user profile includes more information than just your contact details. Here you can see at a glance who you are following, who is following you, the sites you belong to, and the content you have recently added and modified.

1. Open the user menu on the toolbar.

2. Click **My Profile**.

    **Tip:** You can also access your user profile from the My Profile dashlet: click **View Full Profile**.

3. Navigate your profile pages to view and manage your information:

    * **Info**: Displays your personal details, including contact information, company details, and a photo.
    * **Sites**: Lists the sites you're a member of and lets you disable and enable activity feeds from those sites.
    * **Content**: Displays two lists detailing your recent activities: **Recently added** (last 5 pieces of content you added), **Recently modified** (last 5 pieces of content you edited).
    * **I'm Following**: Lists the people you are following.
    * **Following Me**: Lists the people who are following you.
    * **Change Password**: Lets you change your password.
    * **Notifications**: Lets you specify whether or not you want to receive email notifications.
    * **Trashcan**: Lets you find and recover deleted content.

## What version of Alfresco Share am I using?

It's easy to check which version of Alfresco Share you're using.

Click the Alfresco logo at the bottom of Alfresco Share. A box opens showing which version of Share you're working with.

## Subscribing to an RSS feed {#subtorssfeed}

There are several places in Alfresco Share where you can subscribe to RSS feeds. These feeds let you automatically receive regular updates on various activities.

You can subscribe to an RSS Feed in the following places:

* Wiki
* Blog
* Document Library
* Links
* Discussions forum
* My Activities dashlet on your personal dashboard
* Site Activities dashlet on the site dashboard

An RSS Feed button or icon shows you where the feeds are available.

1. Click the ![RSS Feed]({% link content-services/images/ico-rss.png %}) **RSS Feed** button or icon next to a feed you want to subscribe to.

    This initiates the subscription process. What you see next depends on the browser you're using.

2. Choose to subscribe to the feed.

3. Select where you want to store the feed, then subscribe to it.

    > **Note:** RSS feeds credentials are stored by the browser you're using and not Share. As such it's recommended that you close your browser after logging out of Share and / or lock your computer while you're away from it.
