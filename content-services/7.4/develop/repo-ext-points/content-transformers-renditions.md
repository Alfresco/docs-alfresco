title: Content Transformers and Renditions Extension Point
---

Content Services provides many different types of content transformations out-of-the-box. Custom transformations 
can also be implemented and configured.

Architecture Information: [Platform Architecture]({% link content-services/7.4/develop/software-architecture.md %}#platformarch)

## Description

Content transformers transform one type of content into another, such as a HTML file into a PDF file. They are used to 
enable indexing, thumbnails, and preview of content. If the target type cannot be achieved with one transformation 
several transformations can be chained together, such as JSON to HTML to PDF. To implement these transformations, third 
party tools such as PDFBox, LibreOffice, ImageMagic, and Apache Tika are used. There are a number of transformations 
supported out of the box that you should familiarize yourself with before implementing a custom transformer, such as:

* PDF **to** Text, Html or XML
* Word, PowerPoint, Excel + other MS Office formats **->** Text, Html or XML
* HTML **to** Text
* Outlook Email .msg **to** Text
* RFC822 Email **to** Text
* Text **to** PDF
* Office Open XML **to** JPEG
* Apple iWorks files **to** PDFs or JPEGs
* ZIP, TAR **to** Text
* Mediawiki markup **to** HTML

These are just a few of the supported transformations and they can also be combined to form so called transformation 
pipelines when it is not possible to go directly from source mimetype to target mimetype. Renditions are related to 
Transformations and they will be covered at the end of this article.

To find out what transformers are currently registered and active within a Content Services installation, 
you can use an admin Web Script. This is available at 
[http://localhost:8080/alfresco/service/mimetypes](http://localhost:8080/alfresco/service/mimetypes){:target="_blank"}. 
This will list all the currently registered mimetypes, and provide a details link for each one. Selecting the details 
link will then show which transformations are currently supported both to and from that mimetype, and by what transformer. 
If a transformer becomes unavailable (for example, if the JOD/LibreOffice connection fails), then refreshing the list 
will show the updated transformations.

When working with transformations and renditions it is important to make sure that the involved mimetypes are known to 
Content Services. So when accessing the "mimetypes" Web Script make sure the mimetypes that will be used in 
transformations and renditions are included there, if not you would have to register them with Content Services, 
see the [Mimetypes extension point]({% link content-services/7.4/develop/repo-ext-points/mimetypes.md %}) for more information about that.

Related to transformations are **renditions**, and the purpose of them is to provide support for rendering a specific 
content item into other forms, known as renditions. The rendition items are derived from their source item and as such 
can be updated automatically when their source item's content (or other properties) are changed.

Examples of renditions (and rendition engines) include:

* `reformat` - Transforms content to new format - redirects to vanilla transformers
* `image` - Rescales images (including thumbnails)
* `freemarker` - Runs a FreeMarker template against source content
* `xslt` - Runs XSLT on XML source content
* `composite` - A rendition series

Renditions can be performed synchronously or asynchronously and can be created at a specified location within the repository. 
By default they are created as primary children of their source item but it is possible to have them created at other places 
specified explicitly or as templated paths.

The following describes an example with the `reformat` rendering engine and the custom transformation you have previously 
implemented (that is `.json` to `.html`). You can invoke the rendering engine and create an HTML rendition for a JSON document 
via JavaScript executed from a folder rule:

```javascript
var renderingEngineName = 'reformat';
var renditionDefinitionName = 'cm:htmlRenditionDef';
var renditionDef = renditionService.createRenditionDefinition(renditionDefinitionName, renderingEngineName);
renditionDef.parameters['mime-type'] = 'text/html';
var htmlRendition= renditionService.render(document, renditionDef);
```

The rendition definition name is a QName that we have to come up with, use a known namespace such as `cm`. 
The `mime-type` parameter tells the `reformat` rendering engine that the new rendition should be a HTML file. 
By default this rendition will be stored as a hidden child to the uploaded JSON document. If you used the Node Browser 
to inspect the JSON content node you should see three hidden renditions as follows:

```text
**Children    **
Child Name          Child Type   Child Reference                                               Primary  Association Type  Index
*cm:htmlRenditionDef  cm:content   workspace://SpacesStore/78448da2-fbab-4ef1-b451-6bbaa569b8c4  true     rn:rendition       0*
cm:doclib            cm:thumbnail workspace://SpacesStore/f7f354a7-010f-4462-82a1-7cec7f36fa1d  true     rn:rendition       1
cm:pdf               cm:thumbnail workspace://SpacesStore/8b3ec283-cd2a-4378-af2d-e72e30127210  true     rn:rendition       2
```

## Transformation changes from Content Services 6.2

From Content Services version 6.2 it is possible to create custom transforms that run in separate processes known as 
T-Engines (short for Transformer Engines). The same engines may be used in Community and Enterprise Editions. They may be 
directly connected to the Repository as Local Transforms, but in the Enterprise edition there is the option to include 
them as part of Alfresco Transform Service (ATS), which provides a more balanced throughput.

A T-Engine is intended to be run as a Docker image, but may also be run as a standalone process.

Prior to Content Services 6.0 Legacy transformers ran within the same JVM as the Repository. They and their supporting 
classes were deprecated in Content Services 6.0 and have now been removed. Content Services 6.2 still uses them if a 
rendition cannot be created by the Transform Service or Local Transforms. The process of migrating custom legacy 
transformers is described at the end of this page.

One of the advantages of Custom Transforms and Renditions in Content Services 6.2 and above is that there is no longer 
any need for custom Java code, Spring bean definitions, or alfresco properties to be applied to the Repository. Generally 
custom transforms and renditions can now be added to Docker deployments without having to create or apply an AMP/JAR, or 
even restarting the repository.

## Configure a T-Engine as a Local Transform

For the repository to talk to a T-Engine, it must know the engine's URL. The URL can be added as an Alfresco global property,
or more simply as a Java system property. `JAVA_OPTS` may be used to set this if starting the repository with Docker.

```text
localTransform.<engineName>.url=
```

The `<engineName>` is a unique name of the T-Engine. For example, `localTransform.helloworld.url`. Typically a T-Engine
contains a single transform or an associated group of transforms. Having set the URL to a T-Engine, the repository will 
update its configuration by requesting the [T-Engine configuration](https://github.com/Alfresco/acs-packaging/blob/master/docs/creating-a-t-engine.md#t-engine-configuration){:target="_blank"} 
on a periodical basis. It is requested more frequent on start up or if a communication or configuration problem has 
occurred, and a less frequently otherwise.

```text
local.transform.service.cronExpression=4 30 0/1 * * ?
local.transform.service.initialAndOnError.cronExpression=0 * * * * ?
```

### Transformer selection strategy

The repository will use the [T-Engine configuration](https://github.com/Alfresco/acs-packaging/blob/master/docs/creating-a-t-engine.md#t-engine-configuration){:target="_blank"} 
to choose which T-Engine will perform a transform. A transformer definition contains a supported list of source and target 
Media Types. This is used for the most basic selection. This is further refined by checking that the definition also 
supports transform options (parameters) that have been supplied in a transform request or a Rendition Definition used
in a rendition request. See [Configure a Custom Rendition](#configure-a-custom-rendition).

```text
Transformer 1 defines options: Op1, Op2
Transformer 2 defines options: Op1, Op2, Op3, Op4
```

```text
Rendition provides values for options: Op2, Op3
```
If we assume both transformers support the required source and target Media Types, Transformer 2 will be selected because 
it knows about all the supplied options. The definition may also specify that some options are required or grouped.

### Enabling and disabling Local or Transform Service transforms

Local or Transform Service transforms can be enabled or disabled independently of each other. The repository will try to 
transform content using the Transform Service if possible and falling back to a Local Transform. If you are using Share, 
Local Transforms are required, as they support both synchronous and asynchronous requests. Share makes use of both, so
functionality such as preview will be unavailable if Local transforms are disabled. The Transform service only supports 
asynchronous requests.

The following sections will show how to create a Local transform pipeline, a Local transform failover or a Local transform 
override, but remember that they will not be used if the Transform Service (ATS) is able to do the transform and 
is enabled.

```text
transform.service.enabled=true
local.transform.service.enabled=true
```

Setting the enabled state to **false** will disable all of the transforms performed by that particular service. It is 
possible to disable individual Local Transforms by setting the corresponding T-Engine URL property `localTransform.<engineName>.url` 
value to an empty string.

```text
localTransform.helloworld.url=
```

### Configure a custom Local transform pipeline

Local Transforms may be combined together in a pipeline to form a new transform, where the output from one becomes the 
input to the next and so on. A pipeline definition (JSON) defines the sequence of transforms and intermediate Media Types. 
Like any other transformer, it specifies a list of supported source and target Media Types. If you don't supply any,
all possible combinations are assumed to be available. The definition may reuse the `transformOptions` of transformers in the
pipeline, but typically will define its own subset of these.  

The following example begins with the `helloWorld` Transformer described in [Creating a T-Engine](#creating-a-t-engine), 
which takes a text file containing a name and produces an HTML file with a Hello &lt;name> message in the body. This is 
then transformed back into a text file. This example contains just one pipeline transformer, but many may be defined in 
the same file.

```json
{
  "transformers": [
    {
      "transformerName": "helloWorldText",
      "transformerPipeline" : [
        {"transformerName": "helloWorld", "targetMediaType": "text/html"},
        {"transformerName": "html"}
      ],
      "supportedSourceAndTargetList": [
        {"sourceMediaType": "text/plain", "priority": 45,  "targetMediaType": "text/plain" }
      ],
      "transformOptions": [
        "helloWorldOptions"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

* `transformerName` - Try to create a unique name for the transform.
* `transformerPipeline` - A list of transformers in the pipeline. The `targetMediaType` specifies the intermediate 
Media Types between transformers. There is no final `targetMediaType` as this comes from the `supportedSourceAndTargetList`.
* `supportedSourceAndTargetList` - The supported source and target Media Types, which refer to the Media Types this 
pipeline transformer can transform from and to, additionally you can set the priority and the
maxSourceSizeBytes see [Supported Source and Target List](https://github.com/Alfresco/alfresco-transform-core/blob/master/docs/engine_config.md#supported-source-and-target-list){:target="_blank"}.
If blank, this indicates that all possible combinations are supported. This is the cartesian product of all source types to the first
intermediate type and all target types from the last intermediate type. Any combinations supported by the first transformer are excluded. They
will also have the priority from the first transform.
* `transformOptions` - A list of references to options required by the pipeline transformer.

Custom Pipeline definitions need to be placed in a directory of the Repository. The default location (below) may be 
changed by resetting the following Alfresco global property.

```text
local.transform.pipeline.config.dir=shared/classes/alfresco/extension/transform/pipelines
```

On startup this location is checked every minute, but then switches to once an hour if successful. After a problem, it 
tries every minute again. These are the same properties use to decide when to read T-Engine configurations, 
because pipelines combine transformers in the T-Engines.

```text
local.transform.service.cronExpression=4 30 0/1 * * ?
local.transform.service.initialAndOnError.cronExpression=0 * * * * ?
```

If you are using Docker Compose in development, you will need to copy
your pipeline definition into your running Repository container.
One way is to use the following command, and it will be picked up the
next time the location is read, which is dependent on the cron values.

```bash
docker cp custom_pipelines.json <alfresco container>:/usr/local/tomcat/shared/classes/alfresco/extension/transform/pipelines/
```

In a Kubernetes environment, [ConfigMaps](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-pod-configmap/){:target="_blank"} 
can be used to add pipeline definitions. You will need to create
a ConfigMap from the JSON file and mount the ConfigMap through a volume
to the Repository pods.

```bash
kubectl create configmap custom-pipeline-config --from-file=name_of_a_file.json
```

The necessary volumes are already provided out of the box and the files
in ConfigMap `custom-pipeline-config` will be mounted to
`/usr/local/tomcat/shared/classes/alfresco/extension/transform/pipelines/`.
Again, the files will be picked up the next time the location is read,
or when the repository pods are restarted.

> From Kubernetes documentation: Caution: If there are some files in the mountPath location, they will be deleted.

### Configure custom Local failover transforms

A failover transform, simply provides a list of transforms to be
attempted one after another until one succeeds. For example, you may have a fast transform that is able to handle a
limited set of transforms and another that is slower but handles all cases.

```json
{
  "transformers": [
    {
      "transformerName": "imgExtractOrImgCreate",
      "transformerFailover" : [ "imgExtract", "imgCreate" ],
      "supportedSourceAndTargetList": [
        {"sourceMediaType": "application/vnd.oasis.opendocument.graphics", "priority": 150, "targetMediaType": "image/png" },
        ...
        {"sourceMediaType": "application/vnd.sun.xml.calc.template",       "priority": 150, "targetMediaType": "image/png" }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

* `transformerName` - Try to create a unique name for the transform.
* `transformerFaillover` - A list of transformers to try.
* `supportedSourceAndTargetList` - The supported source and target
Media Types, which refer to the Media Types this failover transformer
can transform from and to, additionally you can set the priority and the
maxSourceSizeBytes see [Supported Source and Target List](https://github.com/Alfresco/alfresco-transform-core/blob/master/docs/engine_config.md#supported-source-and-target-list){:target="_blank"}.
Unlike pipelines, it must not be blank.
* `transformOptions` - A list of references to options required by
the pipeline transformer.

### Overriding a Local transform

In the same way as it is possible to combine Local transforms into pipelines, it is also possible to override a
previously defined transform in a file in the _local.transform.pipeline.config.dir_ directory. The last definition read
wins. The configuration from T-Engines or the Transform Service is initially read followed by files in this directory.
Files are read in alphanumeric order. So _0100-basePipelines.json_ is read before _0200-a-cutdown-libreoffice.json_. The
following example removes most of the supported source to target media types form the standard _"libreoffice"_
transform. This is not something you would normally want to do. It also changes the max size and priority of others.

```json
{
  "transformers": [
    {
      "transformerName": "libreoffice",
      "supportedSourceAndTargetList": [
        {"sourceMediaType": "text/csv", "maxSourceSizeBytes": 1000, "targetMediaType": "text/html" },
        {"sourceMediaType": "text/csv", "targetMediaType": "application/vnd.oasis.opendocument.spreadsheet" },
        {"sourceMediaType": "text/csv", "targetMediaType": "application/vnd.oasis.opendocument.spreadsheet-template" },
        {"sourceMediaType": "text/csv", "targetMediaType": "text/tab-separated-values" },
        {"sourceMediaType": "text/csv", "priority": 45, "targetMediaType": "application/vnd.ms-excel" },
        {"sourceMediaType": "text/csv", "priority": 155, "targetMediaType": "application/pdf" }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Configure a custom rendition {#configure-a-custom-rendition}

Renditions are a representation of source content in another form. A
Rendition Definition (JSON) defines the transform option (parameter)
values that will be passed to a transformer and the target Media Type.

```json
{
  "renditions": [
    {
      "renditionName": "helloWorld",
      "targetMediaType": "text/html",
      "options": [
        {"name": "language", "value": "German"}
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

* `renditionName` - A unique rendition name.
* `targetMediaType` - The target Media Type for the rendition.
* `options` - The list of transform option names and values
corresponding to the transform options defined in
[T-Engine configuration](https://github.com/Alfresco/acs-packaging/blob/master/docs/creating-a-t-engine.md#t-engine-configuration){:target="_blank"}.
If you specify `sourceNodeRef` without a value,
the system will automatically add the values at run time. 

Just like Pipeline Definitions, custom Rendition Definitions need to be placed
in a directory of the Repository. There are similar properties that
control where and when these definitions are read and the same approach
may be taken to get them into Docker Compose and Kubernetes environments.

```text
rendition.config.dir=shared/classes/alfresco/extension/transform/renditions/
```

```text
rendition.config.cronExpression=2 30 0/1 * * ?
rendition.config.initialAndOnError.cronExpression=0 * * * * ?
```

In a Kubernetes environment:

```bash
kubectl create configmap custom-rendition-config --from-file=name_of_a_file.json
```

The necessary volumes are already provided out of the box and the files
in ConfigMap `custom-rendition-config` will be mounted to
`/usr/local/tomcat/shared/classes/alfresco/extension/transform/renditions/`.
Again, the files will be picked up the next time the location is read,
or when the repository pods are restarted.

#### Disabling an existing rendition

Just like transforms, it is possible to override renditions. The following example effectively
disables the `doclib` rendition, used to create the thumbnail images in Share's Document Library
page and other client applications. A good name for this file might be
`0200-disableDoclib.json`.

```json
{
  "renditions": [
    {
      "renditionName": "doclib",
      "targetMediaType": "image/png",
      "options": [
        {"name": "unsupported", "value": 123}
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

Because there is not a transformer with an transform option called `unsupported`, the rendition
can never be performed. Having turned on `TransformerDebug` logging you normally you would see a
transform taking place for `-- doclib --` when you upload a file in Share. With this override the
doclib transform does not appear.

#### Overriding an existing rendition

It is possible to change a rendition by overriding it. The following `0300-biggerThumbnails.json`
file changes the size of the `doclib` image from `100x100` to be `123x123` and introduces another
rendition called `biggerThumbnail` that is `200x200`.

```json
{
  "renditions": [
    {
      "renditionName": "doclib",
      "targetMediaType": "image/png",
      "options": [
        {"name": "resizeWidth", "value": 123},
        {"name": "resizeHeight", "value": 123},
        {"name": "allowEnlargement", "value": false},
        {"name": "maintainAspectRatio", "value": true},
        {"name": "autoOrient", "value": true},
        {"name": "thumbnail", "value": true}
      ]
    },
    {
      "renditionName": "biggerThumbnail",
      "targetMediaType": "image/png",
      "options": [
        {"name": "resizeWidth", "value": 200},
        {"name": "resizeHeight", "value": 200},
        {"name": "allowEnlargement", "value": false},
        {"name": "maintainAspectRatio", "value": true},
        {"name": "autoOrient", "value": true},
        {"name": "thumbnail", "value": true}
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Configure a custom MIME type

Quite often the reason a custom transform is created is to convert to or
from a MIME type (or Media type) that is not known to Content Services by default.
Another reason is to introduce an application specific MIME type that
indicates a specific use of a more general format such as XML or JSON. 
From Content Services 6.2, it is possible add custom MIME types in a similar way to
custom Pipelines and Renditions. The JSON format and properties are as
follows:

```json
{
  "mediaTypes": [
    {
      "name": "MPEG4 Audio",
      "mediaType": "audio/mp4",
      "extensions": [
        {"extension": "m4a"}
      ]
    },
    {
      "name": "Plain Text",
      "mediaType": "text/plain",
      "text": true,
      "extensions": [
        {"extension": "txt", "default": true},
        {"extension": "sql", "name": "SQL"},
        {"extension": "properties", "name": "Java Properties"},
        {"extension": "log", "name": "Log File"}
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

* `name` Display name of the mimetype or file extension. Optional for extensions.
* `mediaType` used to identify the content.
* `text` optional value indicating if the mimetype is text based.
* `extensions` a list of possible extensions.
* `extension` the file extension.
* `default` indicates the extension is the default one if there is more than one.

```text
mimetype.config.dir=shared/classes/alfresco/extension/mimetypes
```
```text
mimetype.config.cronExpression=0 30 0/1 * * ?
mimetype.config.initialAndOnError.cronExpression=0 * * * * ?
```

In a Kubernetes environment:

```bash
kubectl create configmap custom-mimetype-config --from-file=name_of_a_file.json
```

The necessary volumes are already provided out of the box and the files
in ConfigMap `custom-mimetype-config` will be mounted to
`/usr/local/tomcat/shared/classes/alfresco/extension/mimetypes`.
Again, the files will be picked up the next time the location is read,
or when the repository pods are restarted.

### Configure the repository to use the Transform Service

By default the Transform service is disabled by default, but Docker
Compose and Kubernetes Helm Charts may enable it again by setting
`transform.service.enabled`. The Transform Service handles
communication with all its own T-Engines and builds up its own combined
configuration JSON which is requested by the repository
periodically.

```text
transform.service.cronExpression=4 30 0/1 * * ?
transform.service.initialAndOnError.cronExpression=0 * * * * ?
```

## Creating a T-Engine {#creating-a-t-engine}

The deployment and development of a T-Engine transformer is simpler
than before.

* Transformers no longer needs to be applied as AMPs/JARs on top of a repository.
* New versions may be deployed separately without restarting the repository.
* As a standalone Spring Boot application develop and test
  cycles are reduced.
* A base Spring Boot application is provided with hook points to extend
  with custom transform code.
* The base also includes the creation of a Docker image for your
  Spring Boot application. Even if you don't intend to deploy with Docker,
  this may still be of interest, as the configuration of any tools or
  libraries used in the transform need only be done once rather than for
  every development or ad-hoc test environment.

### Developing a new T-Engine

The process of developing a new T-Engine is described on the
[Creating a T-Engine](https://github.com/Alfresco/acs-packaging/blob/master/docs/creating-a-t-engine.md){:target="_blank"} page. It walks
through the steps involved in creating a simple Hello World transformer
and includes commands to help test.

When developing new Local Transformers it is generally a good idea to
increase the frequency of the polling of the various locations that
contain custom Pipeline, Rendition, Mimetype Definitions and also of
the Transform Service.

```text
mimetype.config.cronExpression=0 0/1 * * * ?
rendition.config.cronExpression=2 0/1 * * * ?
local.transform.service.cronExpression=4 0/1 * * * ?
transform.service.cronExpression=6 0/1 * * * ?
```

### Migrating a Legacy Transformer

Content Services 6.2 is useful if you already have custom transformers based on the
legacy approach, because it will allow you to gradually migrate them.
Initially you will probably want to create new T-Engines but run them as
Local Transformers attached directly to an repository. All of the
transforms provided with the base Content Services are available as Local
Transformers, so may be combined with your own Local
Transformers in Local Pipelines. Once happy you have every thing working
it then probably makes sense to add your new T-Engines to the Transform
Service. The [Migrating a Legacy Transformer](https://github.com/Alfresco/acs-packaging/blob/master/docs/migrating-a-legacy-transformer.md){:target="_blank"} page
helps by showing which areas of legacy code are no longer needed and
which sections can be simply copied and pasted into the new code. Some of
the concepts have changed sightly to simplify what the custom transform
developer needs to do and understand.

## Alfresco Transform Service (ATS) configuration (Enterprise only)

To configure a T-Engine as a Remote Transform follow the steps described in [Alfresco Transform Service documentation]({% link transform-service/latest/config/index.md %}).
