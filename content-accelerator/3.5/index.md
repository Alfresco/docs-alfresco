title: Alfresco Content Accelerator
---

Alfresco Content Accelerator (ACA) provides a **no-code**, **streamlined interface for fast implementations**. It focuses on quickly building out **business-specific use cases** with reduced reliance on scarce IT and technical support resources, enabling efficient document processing on Alfresco Content Services (ACS).

ACA enables customers to view, search, and manage their content from a friendly and simple modern front-end interface.

There are pre-configured “accelerators” on top of ACA that act as default configurations, or a starting point that the customer, or our services team can tweak to the customer’s unique needs through the no-code configurable administration interface.

These accelerators are:

* [Claims Management]({% link content-accelerator/3.5/index.md %}#claims-management)
* [Policy and Procedure Management]({% link content-accelerator/3.5/index.md %}#policy-management)
* [HR Employee File Management]({% link content-accelerator/3.5/index.md %}#hr-file-management)

More information is included below for the available accelerators. ACA is available for on-premises customers as well as customers in the Alfresco Cloud PaaS.

With the no-code configurable nature of ACA, the interface can be streamlined for other scenarios. ACA has been deployed in production for customers with the following derivative scenarios:

* Accounts Payable / Invoice Management
* Case Management
* Digital Asset Management / Digital Archives
* eForms and dynamic workflow
* Engineering Project Management
* Medical Claims
* Land Management Document Management
* Simple Search and View Interface

Alfresco Content Accelerator can be integrated with Alfresco Enterprise Viewer to provide high-speed and secure viewing of document, video and audio content with team collaborative annotation, redaction and other image manipulation functionality.

See the picture below for a visual representation of how these products fit together:

## Policy and Procedure Management {#policy-management}

The Policy and Procedure Management (PnP) accelerator helps regulated companies such as life sciences, energy, and manufacturers as well as HR departments **maintain quality processes of essential documents** that require strict control over **content lifecycle, reviews, and approvals**.

The intuitive interface facilitates consistency, **collaboration**, electronic review and approval for knowledge workers and provides electronic signatures including **21 CFR Part 11 compliance for life science companies**. Document annotations are supported through using the built in Alfresco Enterprise Viewer to efficiently facilitate document review and approval.

Benefits of the Policy and Procedure Management solution:

* **Time & Cost Savings** – Significant cost and time savings for customers that are using email and manual processes to gather signatures.
* **Compliance** – The interface adheres to the quality regulations from the FDA, ISO, and NRC.  For example, the system ensures that policies and procedures undergo periodic review and limits consumer user access to only Approved and Effective content.  
* **Consistency** - The Policy and Procedure Accelerator drives the approval process based on a configurable change request form which collects relevant data about the change. This approach reduces user decisions and errors commonly found with an ad-hoc or static workflow template approach.
* **Support for Complex Changes** – Allows changes that impact multiple documents to be managed together as a single change package.  
* **Efficiency** – A simple, intuitive interface allows users to easily locate and work with documents, including report generation for management.  
* **Secure** - Document security is tightly controlled by the Alfresco Content Accelerator for Policy and Procedure Management.  Consumer users are only able to access Approved or Released content, while document editors and approvers can create and edit work-in-process versions, ensuring that document consumers are never referencing the wrong version of a policy or procedure document.

Key features:

* **Dynamic Change Request** - Ability to dynamically route based on an intelligent form and business rules one or multiple documents at once for review and gather electronic signatures that are 21 CFR Part 11 compliant for approval.
* **Enforces Standard Version Rules** - Minor versions are applied to draft unapproved content.  Major versions are applied and controlled automatically by the system to approved content.
* **Enhanced Security** - Security based on document status/lifecycle state and user’s group.  Security can be applied and differ across a single document’s versions.
* **Simplified Searching** - Streamlined interface allows users to easily find and retrieve documents using metadata and full text searching.
* **Document Release** - Ability to manage when approved documents are effective and available for use.
* **Alfresco Enterprise Viewer Integration** - seamlessly integrates with Alfresco Enterprise Viewer to allow users to efficiently annotate documents during the review approval process.
* **Dynamic Watermarks** - Ability to dynamically apply metadata and other information to viewed and printed documents.
* **Periodic Review** - Automatically schedules periodic reviews on effective documents to ensure documents do not become stale.
* **Document Obsoletion** - Power users can obsolete documents, which updates the document security so that consumer users can no longer access them.
* **Document Attestation** - Post approval, users can receive a “To Be Read” workflow task that allows the user to attest that he/she has read and understood the document changes.

User interface:

Viewing an Effective document with a linked Change Request form and a linked reference document:

![ACA intro policy management]({% link content-accelerator/images/aca-intro-policy-management.png %})
