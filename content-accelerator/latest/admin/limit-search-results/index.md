title: Limit Search Results
---

In the ACA Admin's search configuration, it's possible for the administrator to define a search results limit.  Based on the underlying repository, however, there are some items to keep in mind:

Alfresco has it's own search results limit.  So, for example if Alfresco is limiting search results to 1,000 and ACA Admin sets the value to 2,000, only 1,000 results max will be returned.
