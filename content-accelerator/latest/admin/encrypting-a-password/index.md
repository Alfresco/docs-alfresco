title: Encrypting a Password

## Obtaining a TSG Encrypted Password
Some TSG configurations require a password encrypted with the TsgEncrypter.  Follow these steps to obtain an encrypted password:

1. Obtain the `tsgrp-x.y.z.zip` file and unzip it to a directory on your local file system
  * Note - this zip can be generated from source by executing this command: `gradle clean distZip`
1. Navigate to `tsgrp-x.y.z/bin`
1. Execute the tsgrp.bat or .sh script as follows, replacing 'myPassword' with your password:
  * Windows: `tsgrp myPassword`
  * *Nix: `./tsgrp myPassword`

If you do not have access to the Zip file generated by the distZip, you can follow these instructions provided you have access to the `tsgrp-x.y.z.jar` file:

1. Navigate to a directory that contains the tsgrp.jar file and execute the following command (replacing the jar version and your text to encrypt with the correct values):

```Batchfile
java -classpath ./tsgrp-1.5.2.jar com.tsgrp.util.TsgEncrypter myPassword
```

### Working with Encrypted Values
As of OpenContent 3.3, TSG Encrypted Passwords can be placed in properties files like the following:

```properties
my.property=@{the-tsg-encrypted-value}
```

By using this token syntax your code reading the property will have access to the decrypted value.  Note that you must inject the property to your code via Spring for this to work properly.
