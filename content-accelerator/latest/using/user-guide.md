title: Using the Content Accelerator
---

The user guide contains general information about the Content Accelerator as well as information about the two domain specific implementations for policy and procedure and claims management.

## Features

When you start using Content Accelerator, you'll see a number of features that guide you through the application.

### Dashboard

The Content Accelerator Dashboard provides an overview and links to relevant content, displayed in individually configurable dashlets. Results within many dashlets are pageable, with configurable results per page and text filtering functionality for finding the right document quickly and easily.

The Dashlets can be reordered on a single page or configured to appear under different tabs. A dashlet can be of a particular type that would be customized for a specific environment to display different information. Here are some of the typical dashlet types available:

* **Saved Search** : A saved search or query that is custom to load results into the dashlet.
* **Inbox** : A collection of workflow tasks (workflow on a doc) that are specific to the signed in user.
* **Active Wizard Inbox** : A collection of wizard workflow tasks (workflow involving forms) that are specific to the signed in user.
* **Recent Objects** : Configurable date range on objects the user has viewed or modified, which provides easy navigation back to the content.
* **Reporting** : A data visualization dashlet displaying graphs and pie charts for specific objects and specific attributes on those objects.
* **Workflow Reporting** : A data visualization dashlet displaying graphs and pie charts specifically for workflows. Would show "In Progress" workflows generated by the user, for monitoring their statuses.
* **Incomplete Tag Dashlet:** A dashlet to view if tags are incomplete and still remain on a particular object. Signifies outstanding items to the user.
* **IFrame Dashlet** : A dashlet that provides access to 3rd party tools via iFrames.
* **Notifications:** A dashlet that displays active notifications the user has yet to complete and archived notifications. See Navigation Bar explanation of Notifications.

Here is an example dashboard in the screenshot below. This is not an actual environment. The following dashlets were put together to demonstrate the many combinations of dashlets a user can have in their application.

### Search

The Content Accelerator Search gives users the tools to locate, filter, and review document and folder information. Content can be searched on using a number of metadata fields, such as document name, creator name, version number, and last modified date. Commonly executed combinations of search parameters can be stored as a "Saved Search", allowing for quick execution of a specific search in the future without needing to re-enter parameters.

![Img Txt]({% link content-accelerator/images/aca-userguide-search.png %})

The above screenshot shows what Search's main components look like and environment specific information will be greyed out as we walk through the general descriptions of its components.

1. Trac (object type) selection.
2. Document type selection.
3. Execute previous saved searches, or click "+" to save current search criteria as a saved search.
4. Provide search criteria here to perform a full text search.
5. Provide search criteria for specific configured metadata fields.
6. The filter tab allows users to filter search results based on property values.
7. Click More Fields to search on other configured metadata fields.
8. Search result controls such as pagination, select results, items per page, and text filtering of results.
9. Table displays results returned by the search, along with configured metadata fields.
10. Reset table settings to its defaults.
    >**Note:** this could be on in some environments and not in others depending on if the administrator turned it on.

Search results can be paginated and filtered all from a single screen without needing to re-execute a search. Many document and folder actions can be performed from Search. There are two easy ways to execute those actions:

1. Check a document or documents and select an available action from the dropdown labeled *Actions* that will appear.
2. Right-click on one or more documents and select an action from the modal that will appear.

To learn more about executing actions within *Search*, reference the Document Actions in Search. These sections will talk more specifically about what actions are available.

### Stage

The Content Accelerator Stage provides tools to review the information and content of documents and folders. Stage gives the user a results view (similar to that of the Content Accelerator Search tool), information about the folder itself, and actions that can be performed at the folder level.

The above screenshot shows what Stage's main components look like and environment specific information will be greyed out as we walk through the general descriptions of its components.

![Img Txt]({% link content-accelerator/images/aca-userguide-stage.png %})

1. **Trac Information:** Various attributes and information appears here about the current Trac's Stage that is loaded. A Trac is an object type.
2. **Workflow Info:** Workflow information is displayed within this section. It will detail information such as the workflow name that is associated with this document, when it started, the tasks, and the processes attached to the workflow.
   >**Note:** this section will only appear when the document is in a workflow and it is turned on by the administrator for the user to see it.
3. **Folder Action List:** Actions that can be executed with the context of the entire folder. Reference the Folder Actions section to see what type of actions can be available in this section.
   >**Note** : this section could potentially be turned off and not seen if no folder actions are applicable.
4. **Object Relations:** Documents typically have relationships to other objects that help with organization. These related objects are displayed in this section with links to that object.
5. **Document Action List:** Actions that can be executed with the context of the document loaded into the document viewer. Reference the Document Actions section to see what type of actions can be available in this section.
6. **Document Viewer:** For viewing document contents, Content Accelerator leverages the Alfresco Enterprise Viewer for previewing and interacting with documents within Stage, giving users access to tools such as annotation and redaction.
7. **Document Title &amp; Additional Document Icons:** The document title will be shown in this section. Also, three icons that will provide the user with more information about the document:
    * **Lock Icon** : The lock icon will display if the document is locked by the current user logged in or another user. See Checkout/Checkin for more information about why the document would be locked.
    * **Conversation Bubble:** The conversation bubble glows to signify if the document has been annotated or not. To annotate a document, Content Accelerator leverages the Alfresco Enterprise Viewer.
    * **Right Arrow:** The right arrow icon will open the document in a new tab to edit the document in a full screen mode.

### Forms

A "Form" in the Content Accelerator provides an interface for completing and submitting electronic forms, such as benefits enrolment, vacation requests, Change Requests, and more. Content Accelerator Forms utilizes a questionnaire approach for gathering information, simplifying the process of filling out forms electronically. Content Accelerator Forms validates the information provided to it, ensuring all necessary data has been provided and notify the user if any required data has not been provided before finishing the creation of the form.

An example of a business scenario that utilizes the Content Accelerator Forms is the Policy and Procedure (PnP) scenario. Check out the PnP's action to Create a Change Form and or the Typical Use Case Scenarios for more information about a real world example using this Content Accelerator feature.

### Form Fields

This area will help you understand the various form controls that you'll encounter when filling out forms in Content Accelerator.

#### Auto Complete

Auto Complete is a text field that will give you completed text after you type a certain amount of characters. Below is an example of a participants list being filled in after typing 3 characters.

![Autocomplete Field]({% link content-accelerator/images/aca-userguide-autocomplete-field.png %})

#### Proximity Date Range

The Proximity Date Range control allows you to select a date range that is relative to the current day. You can choose to search for items within a certain time frame, past the time frame, or in the next time frame.
To use it, select the desired option from the dropdown list. Next, enter a number for the desired unit of measurement, such as days, weeks, or months. Finally, select the appropriate unit of measure from the list. This will define the range of dates you're searching for. Here's an example:

![Proximity Date Range]({% link content-accelerator/images/aca-userguide-proximity-date-range.png %})

### Form Field Attributes

This section outlines the various attributes that can be assigned to form fields within the Content Accelerator platform.

#### Repeating Field

A Repeating Field is a field that allows you to provide multiple values. This type of field has an "Add" button next to the input to allow you to enter additional values. To remove a previously entered entry, click on the X next to it. Here's an example:

![Repeating Field]({% link content-accelerator/images/aca-userguide-repeating-field.png %})

#### Required Field

A Required Field is a field that must be completed before the form can be submitted. These fields are marked with a red asterisk next to the field label. If you attempt to submit a form without completing all required fields, an error message will appear indicating which fields need to be completed. Here's an example of a Required Field:

![Required Field]({% link content-accelerator/images/aca-userguide-required-field.png %})

A submit button will not be able to be clicked until a required field is satisfied see below:

![Required Field Needed]({% link content-accelerator/images/aca-userguide-still-needs-required-fields-or-validation.png %})

Once a required field has been filled the button to submit the form will be available to be clicked again. See below:

![Required Field Satisfied]({% link content-accelerator/images/aca-userguide-required-fields-statisfied.png %})

#### Uneditable Field

An Uneditable Field is a field that cannot be edited by the user. These fields are displayed in a grayed-out or disabled state to indicate that they are read-only. Additionally, you may notice a cancel icon over the field when highlighted, indicating that it cannot be edited. Here's an example:

![Uneditable Field]({% link content-accelerator/images/aca-userguide-uneditable-field.png %})

#### Validation Error

A Validation Error may appear when a field has been filled out with an incorrect value. This is indicated by red text above the field, warning you of the issue. To correct the error, update the value in the field to satisfy the validation criteria. Here's an example:

![Validation Error]({% link content-accelerator/images/aca-userguide-validation-error.png %})

### Navigation Bar

The Content Accelerator Navigation Bar provides a user with links to important areas of the application, ability to execute commonly used actions quickly, notifications to allow for communication, and user preferences to customize the user experience. The Content Accelerator Navigation Bar comes with the following default areas detailed below, but can be customized by the administrator for the application.

![Img Txt]({% link content-accelerator/images/aca-userguide-nav-bar.png %})

#### Header Links

The header links are shortcuts to rapidly access important Content Accelerator features.

![Img Txt]({% link content-accelerator/images/aca-userguide-header-links.png %})

* The **Search header** is a link to the Content Accelerator Search feature. Follow the link to learn more about this section and its capabilities.
* The **Dashboard header** is a link to the Content Accelerator Dashboard feature. Follow the link to learn more about this section and its capabilities.

#### Header Actions

The header actions are a fast and efficient way to execute popular actions that are used frequently.

![Img Txt]({% link content-accelerator/images/aca-userguide-header-actions.png %})

* **Create Form** - Content Accelerator Forms are great resources for completing and submitting electronic forms. To easily build a form the *Create Form* header action becomes crucial. The user can simply click on this header action and immediately begin filling out the specific form they choose from a dropdown list. A specific use case to create a form would be in the Policy and Procedure scenario where users Create a Change Form.
* **Create Folder** - Folders are a helpful resource to provide additional organization of documents or files that are used within Content Accelerator for a particular business's use case. To perform this task of creating a folder with ease, the user can select this header action. A specific use case to create a folder would be in the Claims scenario where users Create a Claim.
* **Add Document(s)** - Adding a document or multiple documents is something a typical user could perform often. An easy way to swiftly accomplish this task can be accessed in the navigation bar. Clicking on the header action will provide a modal to upload a document or multiple documents. To learn more about uploading a document, see Add Documents.

#### Notifications

Notifications within the application are a fantastic way to send out reminders or messages to selected recipients for any relevant use case. The notification section is designated by the bell icon in the right corner of the navigation bar. The bell will glow if the user has a notification or notifications they have not completed. There is also the ability to filter and reference archived (completed) messages. See the action Send Notifications to learn more about how these are sent and received.

![Img Txt]({% link content-accelerator/images/aca-userguide-notifications.png %})

![Img Txt]({% link content-accelerator/images/aca-userguide-notifications2.png %})

#### User Preferences

The following section covers user preferences.

##### Search Preferences

The following options are available for the user to control that are related to their *Search Preferences*:

* **Saved Searches** : A saved search is a way to save a search query that the user runs frequently. This saves the user time and the hassle of remembering exactly what parameters were entered to achieve the desired result.
* **Public Saved Searches** : A public saved search is identical to the regular saved search, however, it is open to all users within the application to use.
* **Table View Columns** : The ability to reset the table view columns configuration. The table view has the ability for various properties to be shown with the tables. This option will reset those to their default values within the application.
* **Search Side Bar** : This functionality is exactly what the description says. It will hide the search form (where you entered all the search parameters) when the search is executed.

##### Dashlet Preferences

The user has the following choices on how they can view or not view different dashlets in the application:

* Dashlet Order: The user can drag to change the order of any or all the dashlets that are seen in their particular dashboard. To reset them to the default settings the user can select the reset button.
* Dashlet Visibility Preferences: The dashlet visibility preferences is a section where the user can turn on or off certain dashlets if they choose to do so. Sometimes, however, the administrator for the application may not give the user that option to not view a dashlet because of its importance. Therefore, sometimes a blank screen might be seen. Like the screenshot below.

![Img Txt]({% link content-accelerator/images/aca-userguide-userpref-dashlet-visibility.png %})

An example of if the administrator of the system would turn that ability on would look something like what the screenshot below shows.

![Img Txt]({% link content-accelerator/images/aca-userguide-userpref-dashlet-visibilities.png %})

##### Workflow (if applicable)

This is a user preference that may not be visible to every user depending on what type of business case/scenario they are using. For example, the Policy and Procedure scenario user would see this while the Claims scenario user would not.

The user has the ability to designate if they are available to receive workflow tasks. The typical use case for this would be when a user goes on vacation. The employee does not want their vacation time to hold up a particular workflow, so they can designate who should complete tasks on their behalf.

![Img Txt]({% link content-accelerator/images/aca-userguide-userpref-workflow-recieve-tasks.png %})

##### Tour

The tour section is initiated when it is the first time the user is visiting the Content Accelerator feature sections of *Search* and *Stage*. This can be switched on or off depending on if the user wants to see the tour again because they forgot all the cool things they can do in each of the *Search* and *Stage* areas.

![Img Txt]({% link content-accelerator/images/aca-userguide-userpref-available-tours.png %})

## Policy and Procedure Solution

The Content Accelerator for Policy and Procedure Management supports efficient and well documented change management of policies, procedures and other quality documents across a variety of industries including life sciences, manufacturing, utility/energy.

The accelerator will allow users to easily change, approve and release both simple business procedures (for example Expense Policy, Hiring Policy, Disciplinary Policy, etc.) as well as more complex and controlled manufacturing and operations documents such as Specifications, Standard Operating Procedures, Batch Records, and Formulation documents.

The Content Accelerator provides repeatable change control for initiating and processing of a change request package with both collaborative review as well as formal and dynamic workflow approval, ensuring that changes to policies and procedures are correctly documented and demonstrate compliance with legal, quality, and regulatory requirements including electronic signatures in compliance.

This section describes actions related to the policy and procedure use case.

### Power Promote

Advance a document to the next lifecycle status by inputting the current logged in user's credentials. For example: Doc's lifecycle status of Draft -> would advance to Approved:

![Img Txt]({% link content-accelerator/images/aca-userguide-policy-procedure-actions-power-promote.png %})

### View Audit Events (Documents and Forms)

An audit trail is kept to keep track of all auditable actions/events that happen with the particular document that is present.

**Example of audit events for a document:**

![Img Txt]({% link content-accelerator/images/aca-userguide-policy-procedure-actions-power-view-audit-events.png %})

**Example of audit events for a form:**

![Img Txt]({% link content-accelerator/images/aca-userguide-policy-procedure-actions-view-audit-events-form.png %})

### Create Change Form

The ability to create a Change Form with the document this action is executed from attached to the form to route through the form's workflow. If there are any other available forms, they will be populated in the dropdown that the user can select.

>**Note:** The Change Form supplied in the PnP environment is a test form created to demonstrate the capabilities of
>Active Wizard forms.

![Img Txt]({% link content-accelerator/images/aca-userguide-policy-procedure-actions-create-change-form.png %})

Once Create Form is selected, the form template appears and there are ![Img Txt]({% link content-accelerator/images/aca-userguide-required-fields-icon.png %}) icons signifying to the user that these areas are required. Below will talk more specifically about each section of the Change Request Form.

![Img Txt]({% link content-accelerator/images/aca-userguide-policy-procedure-actions-create-change-form-example.png %})

The one section worth noting is the *Description and Rationale*. This section depending on what answer is giving will control what page is displayed next to the user. For example, if *Enter test into this form* is selected, like in the screenshot below. Text boxes are shown for the user to input a text rationale.

![Img Txt]({% link content-accelerator/images/aca-userguide-policy-procedure-actions-create-change-form-desc-rationale.png %})

![Img Txt]({% link content-accelerator/images/aca-userguide-policy-procedure-actions-obsolete-doc.png %})

### Acquire Workflow Task

Allows a user to claim a workflow task that is assigned to a group, which the user is in. After performing this action, the user will own the workflow task. In this environment, this is used to acquire the Periodic Review group task for the group `GROUP_wizard_doc_editors`.

![Img Txt]({% link content-accelerator/images/aca-userguide-policy-procedure-actions-aquire-workflow-task.png %})

### Complete Attestation

Users can complete the "To Be Read" (TBR) workflow task, which is a workflow that is sent out to the specified group. The specified group is a property on the document that should be set before the document makes it to an Approved workflow status. When a user attests to the document, they are accepting the document and all changes (if any) made to it.

![Img Txt]({% link content-accelerator/images/aca-userguide-policy-procedure-actions-complete-attestatation.png %})

### Start Review Workflow

### View Wizard Workflow Status

Allows a user to view the status of an Active Wizard form in its current workflow. If the form is in the Draft lifecycle state, this action shows the assigned form approvers with a **Pending** status.

![Img Txt]({% link content-accelerator/images/aca-userguide-policy-procedure-actions-view-wizard-status.png %})

As the form proceeds through the workflow, this action will be updated based on the various status changes such as when a user Approves their task.

### Create Related Form

![Img Txt]({% link content-accelerator/images/aca-userguide-policy-procedure-actions-view-wizard-status2.png %})

Allows a user to create a new Change Form that will have a related association to the current form where the action is executed.

![Img Txt]({% link content-accelerator/images/aca-userguide-policy-procedure-actions-create-related-form.png %})

### Manage Workflow Documents

View, remove, and add workflow document relationships to the current form.

Attached documents:

![Img Txt]({% link content-accelerator/images/aca-userguide-policy-procedure-actions-manage-workflow-docs.png %})

Add documents:

![Img Txt]({% link content-accelerator/images/aca-userguide-policy-procedure-actions-manage-workflow-docs2.png %})

### Set Effective Date

This action can exist on either a form or document. If attached to a form, it presents the ability to set the effective date of each workflow document attached to the form. Conversely, it only sets the effective date for that specific document.

![Img Txt]({% link content-accelerator/images/aca-userguide-policy-procedure-actions-set-effective-date.png %})

### Edit Form

Allows a user to edit the wizard form. Note: this will version the form (0.1 -> 0.2 after editing)

![Img Txt]({% link content-accelerator/images/aca-userguide-policy-procedure-actions-edit-form.png %})

### Cancel Form

Allows a user who is either the owner of the current form or in the wizard administrator group to cancel the wizard form. The form status will be transitioned to Cancelled, and an audit of this event will be created.

Cancel form with closing remark:

![Img Txt]({% link content-accelerator/images/aca-userguide-policy-procedure-actions-cancel-form.png %})

View wizard audit events:

![Img Txt]({% link content-accelerator/images/aca-userguide-policy-procedure-actions-cancel-form3.png %})

### Close Form

Allows a user who is in the wizard administrator group to close the wizard form this is in the Approved lifecycle state. User needs to provide a closing remark, which will be added to the audit trail.

Close form with closing remark:

![Img Txt]({% link content-accelerator/images/aca-userguide-policy-procedure-actions-close-form.png %})

View wizard audit events:

![Img Txt]({% link content-accelerator/images/aca-userguide-policy-procedure-actions-close-form3.png %})

### Copy Wizard Form

Allows a user to copy the metadata (form input/information) from the current form into a new form. The new form will copy the most current version of the form's template.

![Img Txt]({% link content-accelerator/images/aca-userguide-policy-procedure-actions-copy-wizard-form.png %})

![Img Txt]({% link content-accelerator/images/aca-userguide-policy-procedure-actions-copy-wizard-form2.png %})

You may be thinking there has been an error because the form isn't displayed. The form's content is copied over but the approvers need to be re-inputted so the user can validate that the new form should still have those certain approvers. Therefore, click the **Edit Form** action to proceed. Also note that a parent-child relationship is created between the current form and the new copied form.

![Img Txt]({% link content-accelerator/images/aca-userguide-policy-procedure-actions-copy-wizard-form3.png %})

## Policy and Procedure Use Case Scenarios

In this section, daily use cases will be detailed that an individual for the PnP scenario will frequently carry out.

### Upload New Document

To upload a document in the PnP environment, the user will select the header action called *Add Documents*. Once clicking that action the following modal should be seen on the screen.

![Img Txt]({% link content-accelerator/images/aca-userguide-policy-procedure-use-cases-add-docs.png %})

This is the Add Documents action modal that is detailed in the commonly used actions section, see Add Documents. A document or multiple documents can be dragged or uploaded into the upload screen then the Next button would be clicked showing the screenshot below.

![Img Txt]({% link content-accelerator/images/aca-userguide-policy-procedure-use-cases-add-docs2.png %})

A form that consists of the incoming document's properties are filled out at this point with certain fields, such as *Document Number*, are required to upload. Also, notice the Iframe to the right that shows a preview of the incoming document.

![Img Txt]({% link content-accelerator/images/aca-userguide-policy-procedure-use-cases-add-docs3.png %})

Two sections on the form worth noting are the **TBR Groups** and the **Reference Documents**.

* The **TBR Groups** is a field that determines what group(s) the TBR Attestation workflow tasks are sent out to attest to the changes of the document(s) once it reaches approval (See Complete Attestation Action and TBR Attestation)
* The **Reference Documents** are documents related to the uploaded document. A relationship will be created and the relation could be seen under the *Related Objects* section.

### Editing Document (Content & Properties)

Once a document is uploaded, the document can be viewed in the application. Many times a document's content and properties change. Below will talk about how to achieve both.

#### Editing Content

To modify a document's content the document will have to be versioned.
  
* Click on the icon ![Img Txt]({% link content-accelerator/images/aca-userguide-edit-pen-icon.png %}) to *Check Out* the document and press Checkout (See Check Out).
* The document should have been downloaded. Now is the opportunity to make the necessary changes. Before checking the document back in, notice the lock glowing in the top right corner of the viewer. This icon is telling everyone that this particular document is locked by you as you are making changes.
* If it turns out no changes actually needed to be made. The ![Img Txt]({% link content-accelerator/images/aca-userguide-gray-x-icon.png %}) could be clicked to *Cancel Checkout* (See Cancel Checkout).

![Img Txt]({% link content-accelerator/images/aca-userguide-policy-procedure-use-cases-edit-docs.png %})

* When it is time to check the document back in, press the ![Img Txt]({% link content-accelerator/images/aca-userguide-gray-check-icon.png %}) that says *Check In*. The item can be dragged or chosen from the computer to upload back into the application. Then hit submit to check the document back in.
* A couple things to note when a document is checked in.
  1. The lock on the document is released.
  2. The version label has now updated to become the next minor version (e.g. 0.1 -> 0.2).
  3. To view all the versions thus far, see View Versions.

#### Editing Properties

To update a document's properties click the *View Properties* ![Img Txt]({% link content-accelerator/images/aca-userguide-view-props-icon.png %}) icon.
A dual pane should be seen with the document's properties displayed. (See View/Edit Properties).

### Annotations

Annotations are a very powerful collaboration tool that is integrated within this application thanks to the product called Alfresco Enterprise Viewer (AEV).

The annotation tool can be used whenever a form or document is viewed (this viewer is configured by default).

The advantage of using AEV is that it provides additional opportunities to provide feedback on a document. In addition, there are an abundance of use cases that AEV can tackle. During this section, only the particular use cases associated with the PnP scenario will be highlighted.

To understand more of the use cases of AEV please refer to AEV's user guide or relevant documentation.

#### Why use annotations in the PnP Scenario?

The typical use case for annotating a document in the PnP scenario will be during review or the pending approval of a document or form.

As talked about in the Route for Review and Route for Approval sections, the user has the ability to reject the document or form. Annotations can be a great way to show the owner/author of the form what needs to change to seek the user's approval.

#### Route for Review Annotation Use Case

Let's imagine a document is within a Review route and has the status *In Review*. Let's assume the role of a user who has been selected to receive a task to review the document and form. This user goes to complete their task.

Click on the document to bring it up in the AEV document viewer. The user notices a mistake worth noting on the document. They want to leave a sticky note comment for the owner of the document.

![Img Txt]({% link content-accelerator/images/aca-userguide-policy-procedure-use-cases-route-4-review-annotation.png %})

Select the sticky note annotation icon highlighted in the above screenshot. The ability to write a comment within the sticky note annotation is available at this moment. Leave a comment by the "TSG-104" saying something like, "Consider changing this to SOP instead of TSG"

![Img Txt]({% link content-accelerator/images/aca-userguide-policy-procedure-use-cases-route-4-review-annotation2.png %})

Press the **OK** button. The annotation can be seen hovering over the sticky note icon in the document, like below:

![Img Txt]({% link content-accelerator/images/aca-userguide-policy-procedure-use-cases-route-4-review-annotation3.png %})

Another way to view annotation a little cleaner is by expanding the right sidebar where the "1" icon is in the above screenshot:

![Img Txt]({% link content-accelerator/images/aca-userguide-policy-procedure-use-cases-route-4-review-annotation4.png %})

The annotations should be auto-saved but in case they aren't select the **Save** icon highlighted in the following screenshot:

![Img Txt]({% link content-accelerator/images/aca-userguide-policy-procedure-use-cases-route-4-review-annotation5.png %})

Now navigate back to the form. Select the **Complete Wizard Review**. Choose the **Additional Review Needed** under the *Vote* dropdown. Leave a meaningful comment about the annotation and proposed change. Click **Submit**.

![Img Txt]({% link content-accelerator/images/aca-userguide-policy-procedure-use-cases-route-4-review-annotation6.png %})

There are two important things to point out in the above screenshot:

1. Notice in the bottom left corner the annotation icon next to the workflow document. This is a convenient icon notifying to the user across this application that the document has annotations attached.
2. The user action of *Additional Review Needed* will be audited and sent in an email. The owner of the document can navigate to the document and address the concern that was mentioned.

#### Important Notes

Even though the above use case was for the *Route for Review*. The same applies for the *Route for Approval*. The only differences are the status would be *Pending Approval*, the task would be *Complete Approval* where the user would *Reject*. All other actions would be very similar.

The overall goal is to provide the document/form owner a better way to receive feedback and increase the efficiency of collaboration on a document/form.

Like stated in the intro to this section, AEV has an abundance of use cases it can handle. Please refer to AEV's specific documentation walking through those use cases. This section was to provide a couple use cases that AEV can help in the PnP scenario.

### Create Form and Attach Document

The task of creating a form and attaching documents will be a crucial action for a user to carry out within the PnP scenario. Currently, there are a couple different combinations and ways to Create a Form and or attach a document or multiple documents to a form. These are described below. See "Create Change Form" action description for more details.

#### Create a Form Without Document Attached

Sometimes a form is needed without any document attached. To achieve this scenario, the user can select the header action **Create Change Form**:

![Img Txt]({% link content-accelerator/images/aca-userguide-policy-procedure-use-cases-create-form-attach-doc.png %})

When the form has been created notice under the "Related Objects" section that there are no workflow documents attached
(ignore Supporting Documents that is something different):

![Img Txt]({% link content-accelerator/images/aca-userguide-policy-procedure-use-cases-create-form-attach-doc2.png %})

#### Create a Form With Document Attached

A typical use case within the PnP scenario could be when a form needs to be created with one document attached to it.

To start, navigate to a document and click **Create Change Form** button pictured below.

>**Note:** the document should not be attached to another form. If it is, there is the ability to version the document
>then attach to a form (only if that use case makes sense if your instance should you do that)

![Img Txt]({% link content-accelerator/images/aca-userguide-policy-procedure-use-cases-create-form-attach-doc3.png %})

After the form is filled out and created, the workflow document should be seen under the *Related Objects* section. Once the form is taken through the various workflow routes the document will act accordingly (See "Route for Review" or "Route for Approval")

![Img Txt]({% link content-accelerator/images/aca-userguide-policy-procedure-use-cases-create-form-attach-doc4.png %})

#### Create a Form With Multiple Documents Attached

There could be a time when multiple documents are required to be attached and routed in a form. To achieve this first follow the steps in the "Create a Form Without Document Attached" section.

![Img Txt]({% link content-accelerator/images/aca-userguide-policy-procedure-use-cases-create-form-attach-doc5.png %})

When the screen looks like above, go ahead and click on the **Manage Workflow Documents** button. See "Manage Workflow Documents" for more details. The action loads in the right-side pane:

![Img Txt]({% link content-accelerator/images/aca-userguide-policy-procedure-use-cases-create-form-attach-doc7.png %})

Click on the *Add Documents* tab:

![Img Txt]({% link content-accelerator/images/aca-userguide-policy-procedure-use-cases-create-form-attach-doc6.png %})

A search bar is provided that *requires three characters typed as a minimum* to search for documents. There are checks to determine if the document is able to be attached to the form or not. In this case it shows that the *SOP-9756673* is already attached to the current form, therefore, cannot be attached again.

The form should now have multiple documents attached and can be seen in the *Attached Documents* section. In addition, the *Related Objects* area shows both workflow documents attached.
  
### Route for Review

A form with or without documents attached to it often needs to be confirmed by selected approvers to make sure all the items are valid. See "Start Review Workflow" section for more details.

![Img Txt]({% link content-accelerator/images/aca-userguide-policy-procedure-use-cases-route-for-review.png %})

The route for review was designed to select user(s) to be recipients of these review workflow tasks. The ability to filter users can be seen in the below screenshot, as two users are selected to receive the review workflow tasks. Click **Start Review Route** button to start workflow:

>**Note:** The users shown are within different permission roles within the application. To clarify, the review
> route isn't designated for a particular permission role and can have a different assortment of users.

![Img Txt]({% link content-accelerator/images/aca-userguide-policy-procedure-use-cases-route-for-review2.png %})

The screenshot shows what the screen of a user with a review workflow task should look like at this moment. More specifically, the **Complete Wizard Review** should have appeared. Go ahead and click that button.

#### Find Review Task

There are three ways a user can be notified and navigate to their approval workflow task:

1. An email is sent out to the user's email address.

   ![Img Txt]({% link content-accelerator/images/aca-userguide-policy-procedure-use-cases-route-for-review2b.png %})

2. The *Change Control Inbox* is a collection of all the users tasks as well as group tasks (tasks assigned to the group the user is within). Clicking on the *Form Name* will bring the user to the form to view the review task.

   **Note:** that the *Workflow Docs* can be clicked to view this form's document associations.

   ![Img Txt]({% link content-accelerator/images/aca-userguide-policy-procedure-use-cases-route-for-review3.png %})

3. The user can manually search for the document or form within Search to navigate to the task. See "Search" section for more information.

   a) Search for the document:

   1. Choose the *Controlled Docs* option from the top dropdown and input any information in the fields to narrow the search.
   2. Select the document from the search results on the right-hand side to load the document.
   3. Click on the form's link under the *Related CR Form* section to be redirected to the form.

   ![Img Txt]({% link content-accelerator/images/aca-userguide-policy-procedure-use-cases-route-for-review4.png %})

   b). Search for the form

   1. Choose the *Change Control* option from the top dropdown and input any information in the fields to narrow the search.
   2. Select the form from the search results on the right side to navigate to the form.

#### Complete Review Task

At this point there are two decisions the user with the review workflow task can make:

1. Mark as **Ready for Approval**, signifying everything looks good to move toward routing for approval.

   If this choice is selected by all recipients, the workflow will be completed and the "Route for Approval" can be initiated.

2. Mark as **Additional Review Needed**, signifying that there are issues or revisions that still need to be made before routing for approval.

   If this choice is selected, the review route will be aborted so the appropriate changes can be made to the document.

![Img Txt]({% link content-accelerator/images/aca-userguide-policy-procedure-use-cases-route-for-review5.png %})

#### Important Notes for Routing for Review

The user can input comments describing their above choice of action in the textbox.

An email will be sent notifying about the completion of the task.

An audit trail entry will be created for the result of the task (See "Audit Trail" section for more information).

### Route for Approval

A form and any documents attached (if any) that are ready to be approved by the selected recipients within the form can be started by clicking the **Start Approval Workflow**.

Upon starting the approval route, the tasks are sent out to the recipients in the first approval role. In the example case below there are 2 roles: **Initial QA Approvers** and **Approvers**.

![Img Txt]({% link content-accelerator/images/aca-userguide-policy-procedure-use-cases-route-for-approval.png %})

#### Find Approval Task

There are three ways a user can be notified and navigate to their approval workflow task:

1. An email is sent out to the user's email address.

   ![Img Txt]({% link content-accelerator/images/aca-userguide-policy-procedure-use-cases-route-for-approval2.png %}))

2. The *Change Control Inbox* is a collection of all the users tasks as well as group tasks (tasks assigned to the group the user is within). Clicking on the *Form Name* will bring the user to the form to view the task.

   Note that the *Workflow Docs* can be clicked to view this form's document associations.

   ![Img Txt]({% link content-accelerator/images/aca-userguide-policy-procedure-use-cases-route-for-approval3.png %})

3. The user can manually search for the document or form within *Search* to navigate to the task. See Search section for more information.
   Search for the document:

   1. Choose the **Controlled Docs** option from the top dropdown and input any information in the fields to narrow the search.
   2. Select the document from the search results on the right-hand side to load the document.
   3. Click on the form's link under the *Related CR Form* section to be redirected to the form.

   ![Img Txt]({% link content-accelerator/images/aca-userguide-policy-procedure-use-cases-route-for-approval4.png %})

   Search for the form

   1. Choose the *Change Control* option from the top dropdown and input any information in the fields to narrow the search.
   2. Select the form from the search results on the right side to navigate to the form.

#### Complete Approval Task

Now that the approval task can be found. The user should see they have a visible action called *Complete Approval* (See "Complete Approval" section for more information).

![Img Txt]({% link content-accelerator/images/aca-userguide-policy-procedure-use-cases-route-for-approval5.png %})

At this point there are two decisions the user with the approval workflow task can make:

1. **Approve**: if the user selects this option, the workflow will proceed to the next role if there is one. If there isn't a role, the approval route will complete.
   Emails and an audit entry will take place upon approval.

2. **Reject**: if the user selects this option, the workflow will be aborted and all tasks will be canceled. Emails and an audit entry will take place upon rejection.

![Img Txt]({% link content-accelerator/images/aca-userguide-policy-procedure-use-cases-route-for-approval6.png %})

Once all approval tasks are approved the form and any attached documents transition to the Approved lifecycle status/state. The version label is also updated to the next major version (e.g. 0.1 Draft -> 1.0 Approved).

![Img Txt]({% link content-accelerator/images/aca-userguide-policy-procedure-use-cases-route-for-approval7.png %})

#### Important Notes for Routing for Approval

Throughout this test example, users in different permission groups were used. The permission group has an affect on how much the specific user can accomplish.

1. One example would be the *Reassign Task* action is only available to be executed by users who are administrators.
2. If there is a specific question about the permissions pertaining to a certain action please refer to the following documentation:
   1. **Admin Guide** : if your user is an admin, the admin section displays the particular conditions associated with each action.
   2. **PnP Specific Actions** or **Commonly Used Actions**: this section will detail the action more in depth and will touch on permissions when it is relevant to do so.
3. Notable actions that are beneficial throughout the approval workflow:
   1. Reassign Task
   2. Delegate Task
   3. View Wizard Wizard Workflow Status
   4. View Wizard Audit Events
4. **Remember** the approval workflow can be cancelled at any moment. The user has to be either the form owner or an administrator to cancel, though. See "Cancel Workflow" for more details.
5. Emails are sent out throughout the workflow to the various users who are recipients of tasks.

#### Signature Pages

The signature page is a great additional resource to the "audit trail" that provides information about the major wizard events that happen.

After each approval task is completed for each assigned user, a signature entry will be made in the signature page for the document as well as the form.

The form's signature page should look similar to the following screenshot:

![Img Txt]({% link content-accelerator/images/aca-userguide-policy-procedure-use-cases-route-for-approval8.png %})

The document's signature page should look similar to the following screenshot:

![Img Txt]({% link content-accelerator/images/aca-userguide-policy-procedure-use-cases-route-for-approval9.png %})

### Power Promote

There are some instances where the traditional workflow for a document does not fit the particular business need. One of those instances is the approval of a document. A document can be power promoted to the approval lifecycle state/status independent from a workflow. See "Power Promote" for more information.

* Navigate to a document that is within the Draft lifecycle state and make sure the document is not attached to any workflows already.
* Click on the fast-forward icon ![Img Txt]({% link content-accelerator/images/aca-userguide-fast-forward-icon.png %}) labeled *Power Promote*.
  ![Img Txt]({% link content-accelerator/images/aca-userguide-power-promote-controlled-docs.png %})
  >**Note:** Any contributor/editor user will, by default, be able to execute the *Power Promote* action. However, this action's visibility can be configured to only allow a certain group and users.
* Execute the power promote action by inputting the credentials of the user that has selected this action.
* Notice after the action has completed the version label should be the next major version (e.g. 0.1 -> 1.0) and the status is now Approved.
  ![Img Txt]({% link content-accelerator/images/aca-userguide-power-promote-controlled-docs2.png %})

### To Be Read (TBR) Attestation Workflow

The TBR Attestation Workflow is a way for additional users to *attest* to the changes made to the now Approved document.

If you have not been following along through the use case scenarios in order, then please review the "Upload New Document" section. During that section, the `TBR Groups` property on the uploaded document was highlighted. This property needs to be set before the document reaches the Approved state.

![Img Txt]({% link content-accelerator/images/aca-userguide-power-promote-tbr-workflow.png %})

Once a document gets promoted to the Approved state, no matter if it went through "Route for Approval" or "Power Promote", the TBR attestation workflow tasks are sent to the users within the group(s) in that property on the document.

#### Find TBR Task

There are three ways to find the TBR workflow tasks:

1. An **email** is sent out to the user who is in the TBR Group assigned on the property of the document:
   ![Img Txt]({% link content-accelerator/images/aca-userguide-power-promote-tbr-workflow2.png %})
2. The *Inbox* on the *Dashboard*. The *Inbox* is a collection of the TBR workflow tasks that the currently logged in user has to complete. Following the link will direct the user to the document to complete the TBR workflow task:
   ![Img Txt]({% link content-accelerator/images/aca-userguide-power-promote-tbr-workflow3.png %})
3. The user can manually search for the document within *Search* to navigate to the task. See "Search" for more information:

   Search for the document:
      1. Choose the *Controlled Docs* option from the top dropdown and input any information in the fields to narrow the search.
      2. Select the document from the search results on the right-hand side to load the document.

#### Complete TBR Task

The user should see the document and the *Complete Attestation* icon ![Img Txt]({% link content-accelerator/images/aca-userguide-check-icon.png %}). Click on it.

A table full of details about the workflow are provided to the user. If everything looks good and the user is ready to attest to the changes, click *Complete Task*.

### Set Effective Date

The next step in finalizing a document and its contents is to make sure the document transitions from the Approved to the Effective lifecycle state.

Setting the Effective Date signifies the date in which the document should reach Effective status. This will give enough time to decide if there are any more changes that need to be made before the document goes into the final (production) state of Effective.

Once a document has been Approved, there are two ways to *Set Effective Date*:

1. Setting the effective document of multiple documents on the form they are attached:
    1. Navigate to the form where the document(s) are attached. Click on the *Set Doc Effective Dates*.
       ![Img Txt]({% link content-accelerator/images/aca-userguide-power-promote-tbr-workflow4.png %})
    2. The two documents attached to the form show up in the table shown below. Go ahead and set the Effective Date to the appropriate value.
       ![Img Txt]({% link content-accelerator/images/aca-userguide-power-promote-tbr-workflow5.png %})
       >**Note:** the action was run before this screenshot to show what it looks when a document's effective date is set.
2. Setting the effective date of a single document while viewing the document:
    1. Navigate to the document whose effective date needs to be set and click on the *Set Effective Date* icon ![Img Txt]({% link content-accelerator/images/aca-userguide-set-date-icon.png %}).
    2. The action will show only the document that the user is viewing in the table, unlike above where it should multiple documents because it was run from a form. Go ahead and set the Effective Date to the appropriate value.
   ![Img Txt]({% link content-accelerator/images/aca-userguide-power-promote-tbr-workflow6.png %})

#### Make Docs Effective Scheduled Job

At this moment the effective dates are set and no more action needs to be taken by the user. What happens next is a scheduled job that runs in the background will pick up any Effective documents that fit its criteria and promote them to Effective.

The criteria is the following:

1. **Approved** status aspect
2. **Effective Date** is set to the day the job runs
3. Does not have **checkedOut** aspect
4. Does not have **workingCopy** aspect

The job is configured to run at the **top of every hour**.

### Periodic Review

A document in its final state (i.e. Effective) can be in circulation and used for many years. To make sure the document is still relevant, a periodic review date is set on the document upon becoming Effective.

The periodic review date, by default, is set two years from the time it becomes Effective.

#### Initiating Periodic Review Workflow

A scheduled job that runs in the background will determine based on the following criteria if the periodic review workflow should be executed:

1. Document has **Effective** status
2. Within **90 days** of the **periodic review date**
3. Document has **inPeriodicReview** aspect
4. Document doesn't have **checkedOut** aspect
5. Document doesn't have **workingCopy** aspect

The scheduled job is configured to run **every night at 12:30 AM**.

#### Find Periodic Review Workflow Task

Let's assume the scheduled job has run and the periodic review workflow tasks have been sent out to the *GROUP_wizard_doc_editors* (this group is configured as the default).

There are three ways to find the periodic review workflow task:

1. An **email** will be sent out to the configured email address for this particular scheduled job under the property `wizard.periodic.review.default.email`. Consult with the Administrator to configure this property.
2. The *Inbox* will have a collection of tasks assigned to the user that refers to documents. A group task tab will appear with the group name and all tasks associated with it that can be acquired.
   1. Click on the *Acquire* to acquire the task for the periodic review workflow task. This will direct the task into the *My Tasks* section. The group task tab will disappear, if there are no more group tasks for that particular group.
   2. The user will click on the document link to be brought to the document to "Complete the Periodic Review Workflow Task"
   ![Img Txt]({% link content-accelerator/images/aca-userguide-power-promote-periodic-review-workflow.png %})
3. The user can manually search for the document within *Search* to navigate to the task. See "Search" for more information.

   Search for the document
    1. Choose the *Controlled Docs* option from the top dropdown and input any information in the fields to narrow the search.
    2. Select the document from the search results on the right-hand side to load the document.

#### Complete Periodic Review Workflow Task

If the task was acquired in option 2 from above then this step can be skipped. If not, then the *Acquire Task* action icon should be visible ![Img Txt]({% link content-accelerator/images/aca-userguide-aquire-task-icon.png %}). Click on it to acquire the task. See "Acquire Task" for more information.

Once the periodic review workflow task is acquired the *Perform Periodic Review* action icon ![Img Txt]({% link content-accelerator/images/aca-userguide-perform-periodic-review-icon.png %}) should be visible. Click on that to perform periodic review.

The user has two options:

1. Accept the document as is.
   The document's periodic review date will be moved to **two years** from the time the user completes this periodic review workflow task.
1. Do not accept the document as is.
   1. A rejection comment section will appear where the user can leave their comments about their rejection.
   2. The document at this point should be made "Obsolete" or revisions should be made to it.

#### Document Signature Page

The signature page is a great additional resource to the "audit trail" that provides information about the major wizard events that happen.

When the periodic review workflow task is complete, an entry in the document's signature page will be created. The signature page should be similar to the one in the screenshot below:

![Img Txt]({% link content-accelerator/images/aca-userguide-power-promote-periodic-review-workflow2.png %})

### Obsolete Document

For whatever reason, during either the "Periodic Review" or realizing after "Setting the Effective Date", the document is no longer valid in its current state. The document is then going to be transitioned into the Obsolete lifecycle state. See "Obsolete Document" for more information.

The Obsolete lifecycle state signifies that the document is decommissioned and no longer relevant. The Obsolete date can only be designated when the document is in the Effective (final) state.

#### Setting the Obsolete Date

Navigate to the Effective document that should become Obsolete and click on the *Obsolete Document* action icon ![Img Txt]({% link content-accelerator/images/aca-userguide-obsolete-doc-icon.png %}).

The user will fill out the required inputs on the form to then successfully set the obsoletion date. There is no user action needed once this is completed.

The admin can configure the Obselete Document action to require authentication.

Authentication Required:

![Img Txt]({% link content-accelerator/images/aca-userguide-power-promote-periodic-review-obsolete-doc.png %})

Authentication Not Required:

![Img Txt]({% link content-accelerator/images/aca-userguide-power-promote-periodic-review-obsolete-doc2.png %})

#### Make Docs Obsolete Scheduled Job

At this moment the obsolete date is set and no more action needs to be taken by the user. What happens next is a scheduled job that runs in the background will pick up any Effective documents that fit its criteria and transition them to the Obsolete lifecycle state.

The criteria is the following:

1. **Effective** status aspect
2. **Obsolete Date** is set to the day the job runs
3. Does not have **checkedOut** aspect
4. Does not have **workingCopy** aspect

The job is configured to run **every night at 12 AM**.

#### Document Signature Page

The signature page is a great additional resource to the "audit trail" that provides information about the major wizard events that happen. After the document transitions to the Obsolete lifecycle status, the signature page is updated and could look like something below:

![Img Txt]({% link content-accelerator/images/aca-userguide-power-promote-periodic-review-obsolete-doc3.png %})

## Claims Management Solution Features

The Content Accelerator for Claims Management provides:

* A robust and efficient claims content management interface and integration platform to vastly improve access and integration to a variety of content including documents, video and audio files
* Simplified connectivity to any claims data system (ex:  Guidewire, Salesforce, Fineos, or custom built) to provide unlimited access from any client data driven system for the synchronization of claims data, a critical indexing component of claims documents.
* A modern platform for additional business intelligence analytics for claims documents.

As an integrated solution, the Content Accelerator does not require the replacement of existing data systems, only extensions to "electronic file enable" the claim systems saving a huge amount of rework for data processing and document processing if combined in a single effort. Data such as insured name, policy number and claim number can be passed to the solution when the electronic file system is first accessed, saving critical data entry time, effort and reducing errors.

The below integration point can be used from Guidewire, Duck Creek, Salesforce, or any custom system to allow for integration from these systems to create a claim and launch users directly into the claim folder. A typical integration involves generating a URL link on the existing interface that can be put into an iframe or launch a new tab/window that takes the user directly into the claim folder. It will commonly pass in some key metadata from the claims data system to populate and update the claim info each time it is launched.

![Img Txt]({% link content-accelerator/images/aca-userguide-claims-mgmt.png %})

### Stage

Here you can view all information about a claim, the documents linked to a claim, and perform a variety of actions. The guide below walks through a typical example of a Claim Solution's Stage and what can be achieved.

![Img Txt]({% link content-accelerator/images/aca-userguide-claims-mgmt2.png %})

#### Left Sidebar

The left side of the image exhibits the left sidebar. Here, this guide will cover the Claim Informational Panel and the Actions Panel. Please note that clicking on the tab on the left near the top of the panel will minimize the panel, allowing more space for the right side panel.

![Img Txt]({% link content-accelerator/images/aca-userguide-claims-mgmt3.png %})

* The red box labeled `1` outlines the *Claim Informational Panel*. The top most panel's header tells you the type of the current claim folder. Moving down, there is a list of some of the properties from the claim the user is currently viewing.
* The dark blue box labeled `2` outlines the *Actions* dropdown panel. Within this dropdown are actions you can perform on this claim folder.
  * The orange box labeled `a` outlines the **View All Claim Documents** action. This action allows you to view all the documents within the current claim. Upon launching into a claim, this action is automatically active.
  * The pink box labeled `b` outlines the **Claim Notes** action. This action is great for tracking user activity within the claim, as well as creating your notes.
  * The light blue box labeled `c` outlines the **Add Documents to Claim** action. This action allows you to add one or more documents to the claim folder and properties for each of those documents.
  * The brown box labeled `d` outlines the **Send Email** action. This action allows you to send an email to both internal and external recipients, attach documents found within the claim, and can create a personal note based on custom text after sending.
  * The purple box labeled `e` outlines the **Claim Properties** action. This action allows you to view and edit the current properties of the claim folder.

#### Right Side Panel

Direct your attention to the right side of the image. The right side panel is the largest area of the Stage. This area can consist of either one or two panes. Either one or both of these panes can be used as a document viewer, which allows you to work on documents side by side. As seen in the initial screenshot of the Stage, this panel can consist of one pane dedicated solely to an action. Additionally, it can be side by side with a document viewer pane. Two action panes cannot be side by side.

![Img Txt]({% link content-accelerator/images/aca-userguide-claims-mgmt4.png %})

### Search

Some implementations may choose to expose the "Search" interface for searching across various claim and/or document metadata. Search is the easiest way to find a claim based on a set of properties already known to you. In the case only one property is known or even a partial value, search makes it easy to find your desired claims. Additionally, you can search for specific documents that could be located in one or many claims.

After searching, you can navigate to the displayed results and perform multiple actions on those documents. Below is an example of a Claim Solution's Search and the features can be accomplished:

![Img Txt]({% link content-accelerator/images/aca-userguide-claims-mgmt5.png %})

#### Search Form

The search form is where you enter the criteria you wish to search on. Upon navigating to search, this form appears on the left side of the search underneath the search header. Clicking the tab near the top left corner of the pane will open and close the search view.

![Img Txt]({% link content-accelerator/images/aca-userguide-claims-mgmt6.png %})

When searching, some criteria allow for wildcard characters. Here, the asterisk (*) is a wildcard character that allows
you to search for all possible documents in the repository.

* The red box labeled `1` outlines the object type selector box. Here, you can choose between searching for Claim Folders or Claim Documents. Currently, we are searching for claim documents, as 'Claim Documents' is selected in the dropdown.
* The orange box labeled `2` outlines the saved search input box. Before searching, you can select a pre-saved search from the dropdown list. A saved search stores the values of the previous form into an easy-to-remember text the user can define. This can save you from reentering all the criteria for searches you use everyday. To save a new search, type in the criteria for the search, execute the search, click the plus icon within the saved search input box, and input what you would like your search to be called. You can manage your saved searches from the User Preferences page.
* The dark blue box labeled `3` outlines the full text search box. This field consists of two parts, the input box and the search button. The input box is where you enter any text that could match any property. The returned claims will have at least one property that matches the input text exactly. The button on the right of the box will execute the search. Additionally, the search button at the bottom of the form and the enter key will also execute the search.
* The pink box labeled `4` outlines the attribute search tab. Within this tab, you can add criteria for properties you wish to search. Some properties' criteria can be selected from a dropdown or date picker. Others, such as Claim Number, need to be entered in manually. The results will return all items that match any part of the criteria for the respective property. If the property you wish to search on does not appear, check the more fields section at the bottom of the attribute search tab. You can enable advance search capabilities in Attribute Search. See the next section for additional information on enabling [Advanced Search capabilities with Attribute Search](#advance-search-capabilities-with-attribute-search).

  > **Note:** Not all claim properties will appear in the form.

* The light blue box labeled `5` outlines the filters tab. After a search has already been run, this tab will populate with filters based on the result.

  ![Img Txt]({% link content-accelerator/images/aca-userguide-claims-mgmt7.png %})

  Here, the results returned had 12 different values within the document category property. The number to the right represents the number of results that match the criteria stated on the left. Selecting the checkbox will remove all results from search results pane that do not match the criteria selected. The reset button at the top left removes all selected filters.

* The purple box labeled `6` is where you can submit your search form, executing the search. This can also be done by clicking the search button in the full text search input box or by hitting the enter key while within the form. Clicking the reset button empties all previous entered criteria in the form without running another search.

### Advance Search capabilities with Attribute Search

Attribute Search includes the option to configure Advanced Search capabilities within the search form. To enable advanced capabilities in attribute search, navigate to the Attribute Search config in the Alfresco Content Accelerator Admin. By default, the values are set to `Disabled`:

To enable advanced capabilities in attribute search, complete the following steps.

1. Navigate to the Attribute Search config in the Alfresco Content Accelerator Admin and set the value of the Show Advanced Search parameter to Enabled. By default, the value is set to Disabled.

    ![Advanced Search configuration]({% link content-accelerator/images/aca-show-advanced-search-config.png %})

2. After you enable Advanced Search, you can enable the following configuration settings:

    * Enable Any/All Search
    * Enable Like/Exact/Not Search

    ![Advanced Search additional configuration]({% link content-accelerator/images/aca-show-advanced-search-options-config.png %})

When the **Enable Any/All Search** setting is enabled, you can configure either of the following settings.

| Settings | Search operator |
| -------- | --------------- |
| ANY of these values | If you select this option, search is performed based on the `OR` operator |
| ALL of these values |	If you select this option, search is performed based on the `AND` operator |

If the **Enable Any/All Search** setting is disabled, `AND` operation is the default operation.

When you enable the **Like/Exact/Not Search** setting, an additional control is added to the Attribute Search form. The control includes an advanced operator selection drop-down. This drop-down is only available to properties with control type `TextBox`, `AutoComplete`, and `DropDown`.

The list of operators included in the drop-down is based on the associated property data type. The following table lists the data types and the operators associated with it.

| Data type | Operators |
| --------- | --------- |
| String | `LOGIC_LIKE`, `OPERATOR_EQUALS`, `OPERATOR_NOT_EQUALS` |
| Integer or Double | `OPERATOR_LESS_THAN`, `OPERATOR_EQUALS`, `OPERATOR_GREATER_THAN`, `OPERATOR_NOT_EQUALS` |

The operators listed above are described below:

* `LOGIC_LIKE` - Performs a wildcard (%) search 
* `OPERATOR_EQUALS` - Performs a exact (=) value search
* `OPERATOR_NOT_EQUALS` - Performs a not exact (-) value search
* `OPERATOR_LESS_THAN` - The search returns results less than (<) the provided search term.
* `OPERATOR_GREATER_THAN` - The search will return results greater than (>) the provided search term.

If the **Like/Exact/Not Search** setting is disabled, the default operation depends on the object type. The following table lists the default operation based on the object types.

| Object | Default operation |
| ------ | ----------------- |
| **AutoComplete** and **DropDown** | Exact search with case sensitivity |
| **RadioButton** and **Cascading** | Exact search |
| **TextBox** | The search depends on values set using “Make Search Exact” and “Case Sensitive Search” and if these values are not set, a wildcard search is performed. |

> **Note:**
>
> * Advanced Search is deprecated in Content Accelerator 3.6. Though it is still available, Advanced Search feature in Attribute Search, described above, is expected to replace Advanced Search in future releases.
>
> * By enabling “Like/Exact/Not Search”, you override the settings for “Make Search Exact” and “Case Sensitive Search” for any property (if configured).
>
> * On a Property or Full text search, when any value is enclosed in double quotes, it is considered an exact search.
>
> * Popular special characters can be searched on Property and  Full text searches. How special characters are treated depends on tokenization and search index configuration. For additional information, see the [Alfresco Search Services documentation]({% link search-services/latest/index.md %}) and [Apache Solr Reference Guide](https://solr.apache.org/guide/solr/latest/index.html){:target="_blank"}. 

#### Search Results Pane

Here you can navigate the results, change how the results are displayed, further filter the results down, and perform actions on some or all of the results.

![Img Txt]({% link content-accelerator/images/aca-userguide-claims-mgmt8.png %})

* The red box labeled `1`: outlines the search results control bar. This control bar allows the user to interact, modify, and update the table below it. It consists of 5 main controls but can change depending on the state of the table. Below the controls displays the number of search results returned with the previous search as well as an icon. Hovering over the icon will display detailed timing information about search execution.
  * The brown box labeled `a`: outlines the pagination control. You can navigate the various pages of the results using the Prev and Next buttons. Clicking on the page number dropdown in the center allows you to jump to a specific page number.
  * The light blue box labeled `b`: outlines the selection control. When items in the table are selected, the number of selected items will be displayed. Clicking on the control allows you to select all items in the table across all pages or deselect all selected items.
  * The purple box labeled `c`': outlines the results per page control. Here you can select how many items you wish to display in the table below.
  * The pink box labeled `d`: outlines the actions control. The actions control will appear when one or more items are selected. This dropdown can also be accessed by right-clicking on a selected item and applies to all selected items.
  * The green box labeled `e`: outlines the quick filter control. This filter allows you to narrow down the results that displayed. This filter removes all results except those that have a partial match of the text you entered to a table property. Note this filter will filter across all pages.
* The dark blue box labeled 2: outlines is the table display options. Currently listview is selected and displayed green. You can toggle table display view, also known as thumbnail view, by clicking on the camera icon. This will show a preview of each item in the results table. Below is an image of the table in thumbnail view. Note right-click functionality is disabled for thumbnails.

  ![Img Txt]({% link content-accelerator/images/aca-userguide-claims-mgmt9.png %})

* The orange box labeled 3: outlines the search result's table. This table lists all the search results, displaying important properties along its x-axis within the header. Right clicking on the table header allows you to add or remove various claim properties. Clicking the checkbox in the top right corner selects all items on the current page. The checkboxes down the right side allow you to select or deselect individual items. Right clicking on the table when in listview will show potential actions you can perform on the selected items. Clicking on the blue linked item name will route you to Stage if in search. If clicking on a document, Content Accelerator will also open the document viewer for that document.

### Navigation Bar

At the top of the following image is the navigation bar allowing you to navigate to different views or perform actions. Here, this guide will cover Search, Dashboard, and Create New Claim.

![Img Txt]({% link content-accelerator/images/aca-userguide-claims-mgmt10.png %})

* The red box labeled `1` outlines the Search. Clicking there will navigate you to the search view, where you can search for all the claims based on a variety of conditions.
* The orange box labeled `2` outlines the Dashboard. Clicking there will navigate you to the dashboard view.
* The blue box labeled `3` outlines the "Create New Claim" Action. This allows you to quickly create a new claim regardless of the current view.
