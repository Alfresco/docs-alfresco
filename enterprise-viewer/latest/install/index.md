title: Install Enterprise Viewer
---
This documentation is used for the installation of the Alfresco Enterprise Viewer (AEV).

AEV can be used without Alfresco Content Accelerator (ACA). The following instructions are more from that standpoint, 
installing AEV on its own without ACA. For the most part, the installation is similar, but there are different 
components. For example, when not using ACA, AEV needs to be placed in an ADF application UI or the Alfresco Share UI.

The following installation scenarios exist:

* ACA and AEV installed together (see ACA installation instructions)
* ACA installed without AEV (see ACA installation instructions)
* AEV installed without ACA and integrated with [Share on Windows]({% link enterprise-viewer/latest/install/share-windows.md %}) or [Share on Linux]({% link enterprise-viewer/latest/install/share-linux.md %})
* AEV installed without ACA and integrated with [ADF on Windows]({% link enterprise-viewer/latest/install/adf-windows.md %}) or [ADF on Linux]({% link enterprise-viewer/latest/install/adf-linux.md %})
