title: Alfresco Enterprise Viewer Configuration Files
---

When installing and setting up Alfresco Enterprise Viewer it's important to understand how configuration settings work.

### Spring Properties Files

### AEV Web Application Properties

Spring loads properties files into the system in a specific order to allow overriding.  Properties are loaded in the following order (last wins):

1. `defaults.properties` (sensible defaults for every property)
1. `project-placeholders.properties` (project specific properties)
1. `openannotate-override-placeholders.properties` (Optional. Tomcat Specific properties)
1. `override-placeholders.properties` (environment specific properties)

In general, use the `openannotate-override-placeholders.properties` to override any of the default properties.  This file must be placed on the tomcat classpath (for example, in the `<TOMCAT_HOME>/shared/classes` folder), and will override all properties located in the OpenAnnotate.war.  Properties defined here can still be overridden by `override-placeholders.properties`, but if for example server urls are all that needs to be defined, these can be left in `openannotate-override-placeholders.properties`, allowing WARs to be promoted through various environments without needing to be re-built / configured.

### OpenContent Properties

OpenContent properties related to AEV are located in the `universal-defaults.properties` file.  Any of these properties can be overridden if desired in the `opencontent-override-placeholders.properties` file.   

### Default Properties

The following are the configurable properties for Alfresco Enterprise Viewer:

#### serviceAccountUsername

This is the service account username to use when logging in using the "stored" endpoint. The stored endpoint allows you to log in using the configured service account and provide a displayName to identify the user you are logging in for. **NOTE: This property must be overridden if you're using the "stored" endpoint.**

Default Value: `""`

#### serviceAccountPassword

This is the service account password to use when logging in using the "stored" endpoint. The stored endpoint allows you to log in using the configured service account and provide a displayName to identify the user you are logging in for. **NOTE: This property must be overridden if you're using the "stored" endpoint.**

Default Value: `""`

#### isServiceAccountPasswordEncrypted

True if the password for the service account for the stored login endpoint is encrypted, false otherwise.

Default Value: `false`

#### serviceAccountDocbase

The docbase the service account should login to

Default Value: `""`

#### emailInviteUrl

This URL is the URL to use in the invitation to collaborate email. If the `[docId]` placeholder is specified, it will be replaced by the `objectId` of the document being viewed when the invitation is sent.

Default Value: `http://localhost:8080/OpenAnnotate/viewer.htm?docId=[docId]&presenterMode=true&mode=readOnly`

#### ocRestEndpointAddress

This URL is the REST endpoint for the running instance of OpenContent. If Alfresco Enterprise Viewer is being used in a load balancing setup and the instances of Alfresco Enterprise Viewer and OpenContent are on the same server, this property should be the **non-load balanced url**, to ensure that the requests to OpenContent are always directed to the same OpenContent instance.

Default Value: `http://localhost:8080/OpenContent/rest`

#### clientRequestUrl

The URL that client requests from Alfresco Enterprise Viewer to OpenContent should be made to. This generally will only be change if OpenContent has a different rest root, `/alfresco/OpenContent` for example used when OC is an Alfresco subsystem.

Default Value: `/OpenContent/rest`

#### collaborationEndpoint

This URL is the endpoint on which the web socket server is listening for a connection. This should be used when Alfresco Enterprise Viewer is being run in collaboration mode. If collaboration mode is enabled but this property is not specified, collaboration mode will not work properly.
For load balanced setups, there should only be a single collaboration server. So this should point to the **single, non-load balanced url**.

Default Value: `http://localhost:3000`

#### collaborationModeEnabled

This property represents whether or not Alfresco Enterprise Viewer is being run in collaboration mode to take advantage of features like real-time annotations and chat functionality.

Default Value: `false`

#### forceNonModalNotifications

This property represents whether or not Alfresco Enterprise Viewer will force non modal notifications.

Default Value: `true`

#### singleAnnotationDialog

True if only ever one annotation dialog should be open at a time, false otherwise.

Default Value: `true`

#### excludeEmbeddedAnnotations

True if annotations embedded on the pdf should not be fetched, false otherwise.

Default Value: `true`

#### serverAnnotationsEditable

True if server annotations can be edited. Setting this to false prevents users from editing their annotations after their session ends.

Default value: `true`

#### sidebarDefaultOpen

This property represents whether or not Alfresco Enterprise Viewer  should start up with its sidebar (which contains other modules like summary, search and collaboration) showing.

Default Value: `true`

#### helpUrl

This URL points to a "help" website for using Alfresco Enterprise Viewer. **This is not recommended to be overridden.**

Default Value: `http://www.tsgrp.com/Open_Source/OpenAnnotate/open_annotate.jsp`

#### printSummaryBaseType

This is the base type to use when fetching the attributes for the print summary window. If the attributes specified are not attributes on this type, Alfresco Enterprise Viewer will fail to initialize properly.

Default Value: `Document`

#### oaLogoPath

The path for the logo to display at the top left corner on the toolbar in the Alfresco Enterprise Viewer interface. Useful to override for different logos. This path is relative to the `src/main/webapp` directory.

Default Value: `images/logos`

#### oaIconPath

The path for the icons to display in the Alfresco Enterprise Viewer interface. This path is relative to the `src/main/webapp` directory.

Default Value: `images/icons`

#### targetMimetype

The target mimetype to use when transforming documents. Defaulted to PNG, but support JPG (image/jpeg) as well.

Default Value: `image/png`

#### imageFullResolution

The final resolution to use when transforming image pages to PNG or JPG. Lower resolutions may be loaded first.

Default Value: `64`

#### imageMinimumResolution

The minimum resolution to load the image when progressively loading the image

Default Value: `16`

#### pdfFullResolution

The final resolution to use when transforming PDF pages to PNG or JPG. Lower resolutions may be loaded first.

Default Value: `244`

#### pdfMinimumResolution

The minimum resolution to load the image when progressively loading the image

Default Value: `64`

#### progressiveReloadSteps

The number of reloads to make between the minimum resolution image, and the full resolution.

Default Value: `1`

#### pageZoom

The initial page zoom to use when loading a document. The allowed values are either `fitHeight` or `fitWidth`. Fit height will adjust the document so the entire height is visible. Fit width will adjust the document so the entire width is visible.

Default Value: `fitWidth`

#### numPreloadPages

The number of pages to preload. Preloading works by making requests to fetch pages close to the current page the user is viewing in order to cache the image, which results in shorter load times when the page is changed. The allowed values are the following:

* `0`: This tells AEV to preload all the pages of the document
* `-1`: This tells AEV to not use preloading at all
* Any other positive integer: This integer specifies the total number of pages to preload - half will be pages forward from the current page and the other half will be behind the current page. **The configured value should therefore be a multiple of 2. Because the number of pages to preload is divided in half, specifying `1` and `2` accomplishes the same thing.** Once the number of preloaded pages equals the configured value, no more pages will be preloaded until the page is changed.

Default Value: `10`

#### enhancedColorMode

This flag controls the colors that are displayed and allowed to be chosen for annotations. If set to `true` there is no limit on the color of created annotations and the downloaded annotations will maintain their colors. If set to `false` the user may not choose different colors for annotations and instead, all of the user's annotations will be red (or yellow if it's a highlight) and all other annotations will be blue (the same is true for the downloaded annotated PDF).

Default Value: `true`

#### dateFormat

The format to use when displaying dates in annotation dialog boxes. The formatting uses the open source library Moment.js, so any formats found on the Moment.js [formatting docs](http://momentjs.com/docs/#/displaying/format/) may be used.

Default Value: `MM/DD/YYYY`

#### enabledActions & Modes

Configuring what Buttons / Actions appear in Alfresco Enterprise Viewer is a little more in-depth than the average config option.  See
[Configuring Alfresco Enterprise Viewer Actions Buttons and Modes](/enterprise-viewer/latest/config/aev-actions-and-modes-config) for more details.

#### quillEnabledButtons

A comma separated list of buttons that are visible in the quill toolbar. Currently, only Italic and Bold are supported. All currently supported quill buttons are bold, italic, and underline.

Default Value: `drawRedaction, signature, mouse`

#### autosaveInterval

The number of milliseconds Alfresco Enterprise Viewer will wait between each autosave.

* `0`: This tells AEV to NOT autosave.
* Any other positive integer: The number of milliseconds Alfresco Enterprise Viewer will wait between each autosave.  This should not be set to a number below 5000 - 10000 (five to ten seconds), as it could cause undefined behavior.

Default Value: `60000`

#### autosaveBeforeExit

True if Alfresco Enterprise Viewer should automatically save before exiting, false otherwise.

Default Value: `true`

#### enabledPopupNotifications

This is the list of the Collaboration mode notifications that are enabled and will therefore appear on the on internal popups when the Participants tab is close. To disable a type of notification, remove it from the list of notification in this property.  The default is that all notification are enabled.

Default Value: `chat,userJoined,userLeft,serverConnection,checkInAnnotations,checkInAnnotationsFailed,burnInRedactionFailed,checkinAnnotationsFinished,pageSelectMode,welcomeBackPage,save,loadedAnnotations,saveFinished,copyPaste,copyPasteNotReady,tooLargeForThumbnails,closeSave,closeCopyPaste,pageRangeInvalid,logstashFailed,portfolioContainsNonPdf,docHasAnnotations,afterPageLoad,textLocationDataFailed,enterSectioningMode,sectionNameInvalid,displayDocumentListFailed`

#### slideViewerTileDirectoryRoot

This is the root directory on the server filesystem where the slide viewer "tiles" should be served from. It is commonly a URL that is redirected through Apache to request files from the server. 

Default Value: `http://localhost:8080/OpenAnnotate/images/seadragon/`

#### sessionCookieName

The name of the session cookie which is used to track sticky sessions in load balanced environments.  For load balanced environments, sticky sessions are required to ensure Alfresco Enterprise Viewer always hits the correct correct OpenContent with all its internal requests.

Default Value: `JSESSIONID`

#### checkServletRequestForSessionId

True if we should check for the sessionId on the Servlet requests from Alfresco Enterprise Viewer's frontend and append it to the requests to OC, false otherwise.  This sessionId is used to maintain sticky sessions in load balanced environment.  If both this property and checkServletCookieForSessionId are both set, the sessionId set on the Servlet request will override any sessionId set on the cookie.

Default Value: `true`

#### checkServletCookieForSessionId

True if we should check for the sessionId on a cookie and append it to the requests to OC, false otherwise.  This sessionId is used to maintain sticky sessions in load balanced environment.  If both this property and checkServletRequestForSessionId are both set, the sessionId set on the Servlet request will override any sessionId set on the cookie.

Default Value: `true`

#### snapThreshold

This value is the % of a highlight must overlap a word for it to be detected as a word.  Highlights will snap to the detected words and get the underlying text.  If no highlight snapping is desired, this should be set to a value over 100% (i.e. < 1.0).  The gifs below show the results of different values of snapThreshold:

10% ( =0.1)

![Highlight Snap Threshold 10%]({% link enterprise-viewer/images/snap-threshold_10.gif %})

40% ( =0.4)

![Highlight Snap Threshold 40%]({% link enterprise-viewer/images/snap-threshold_40.gif %})
