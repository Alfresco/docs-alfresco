title: Alfresco Enterprise Viewer
---

The Enterprise Viewer is a browser-based tool that allows a user to create, share, and view annotations on a document
within your Content Services repository. The Enterprise Viewer supports annotating with sticky notes and drawing tools
including lines, arrows, circles, and rectangles. The Enterprise Viewer also supports highlighting text or striking out
text.

The Enterprise Viewer supports annotating the following file formats: Word, Excel, PowerPoint, PDF, JPG, PNG, GIF and
Tiff. Additional formats can be supported through renditions to the PDF format including AutoCad, text files, and others.
The tool integrates with rendering software to convert the pages of a document into PNG images that can be viewed and
annotated though any web browser, eliminating the dependency on specific client viewing applications.

In addition to adding annotations, this tool allows users to redact content such as text or images from a file. Users
are also able to edit and rearrange pages of a document. This tool can run as a standalone tool, or can be launched via
existing client interfaces such as Alfresco Share, ADF, or Alfresco Content Accelerator.
