## AEV Embedded in ADF

Alfresco Enterprise Viewer (AEV) can be integrated into Alfresco Developer Framework (ADF) applications by replacing or overriding the default ADF Viewer component behavior.

An ADF application with AEV integrated is provided as part of the AEV deployment artifacts (content-app-with-aev.war). This application is based off of Alfresco Content App version 3.8.
