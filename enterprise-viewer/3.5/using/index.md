## Add Annotations Interface

This section walks through the interface used to add annotations.

### Toolbar

The toolbar contains all the core functionality of the Enterprise Viewer in Annotation mode. This is where document navigation and zooming occur, and where annotations can be created, saved, and more information on Enterprise Viewer is found.

It is located at the top of the Enterprise Viewer window:

![Img Txt]({% link enterprise-viewer/images/aev-annotations-interface-toolbar.png %})

Dark grey buttons cannot be used until certain actions are made. A button that is in use will have a blue interior.

#### Manual Page Navigation

If the page number entered is not a number, this value gets reset to the current page. If the page number entered is lower than the first page, the user is navigated to the first page. If the page number entered is higher than the last page, the user is navigated to the last page.

![Img Txt]({% link enterprise-viewer/images/aev-annotations-interface-toolbar2.png %})

Manually entering a value into this text field and then hitting the Enter key will navigate to the new page number.

This text field is located to the right of the Enterprise Viewer logo and to the left of the **Fit to Height** button.

#### Total Number of Pages

This is a non-editable field denoting the total number of pages for the document.

#### Fit to Height

The **Fit to Height** button is located to the right of the Manual Page Navigation text field and to the left of the **Fit to Width** button.

![Img Txt]({% link enterprise-viewer/images/aev-annotations-interface-toolbar3.png %})

Clicking this button automatically calculates the zoom level to make the window show the entire height of the document. This does not take into account the width of the document, and thus scroll bars may appear horizontally depending on the page's aspect ratio against the size of the window.

#### Fit to Width

The **Fit to Width** button is located to the right of the **Fit to Height** button and to the left of the **Next Page** button. The **Fit to Width** button is to the left of the **Zoom Out** button if the **Next Page** button is not displayed in the toolbar:

![Img Txt]({% link enterprise-viewer/images/aev-annotations-interface-toolbar4.png %})

Clicking this button automatically calculates the zoom level to make the window show the entire width of the document. This does not take into account the height of the document, and thus scroll bars may appear vertically depending on the page's aspect ratio against the size of the window.

#### Next Page

The **Next Page** button is located to the right of the **Fit to Width** button and to the left of the **Previous Page** button.

![Img Txt]({% link enterprise-viewer/images/aev-annotations-interface-toolbar5.png %})

Clicking this button zooms out in increments of ten. While zooming out, if possible, the current middle of the page will remain in the middle (unless zooming out reveals an image that does not need to be scrolled).

If the target zoom level is below the minimum zoom level, the zoom is set to the minimum zoom level. This is set for performance and usability reasons.

#### Zoom In

The **Zoom In** button is located to the right of the **Zoom Out** button and to the left of the Download dropdown.
