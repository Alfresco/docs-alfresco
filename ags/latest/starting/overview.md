title: Getting started with Governance Services
---

## Overview

Although Alfresco Governance Services has a huge amount of functionality available, it's actually pretty easy to learn the essentials and get up and running.

What you do in Governance Services will vary hugely depending on your role, and how your company is organized. 
This guide is split into two sections, one for [Governance Services managers]({% link ags/latest/starting/managers/overview.md %}), 
and one for [Governance Services users]({% link ags/latest/starting/users/overview.md %}). 
You might find that these guides don't exactly match what you do in your day-to-day job, 
but even if they don't you should find them useful in getting started, and in understanding the basic concepts 
of Governance Services and how the processes fit together.

Common for both roles is the record lifecycle. You can create a record either by uploading it to the 
Records Management File Plan, or by declaring a file in another Alfresco site as a record.

When you have added all required metadata to a record you can mark the record as complete. 
This makes it an active part of the File Plan, and subject to the rules of the retention schedule it is 
associated with.

It then goes through various time and event based steps such as cut off and retention, 
until it is eventually transferred elsewhere, or destroyed, according to its retention schedule.
