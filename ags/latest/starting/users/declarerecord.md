title: Declaring a file as a record
---

You can create records from files in non-Records Management sites and add them straight into the File Plan.

1. In the *Document Library* of an Alfresco site find the file you want to declare as a record.

2. Hover over the file and click **More** then **Declare as Record**.

    The file is added to the *Unfiled Records* area, in the explorer panel of your Records Management site. 
    It's still visible in its original site, identified by the ![Easy access record]({% link ags/images/ico-rm-inplace.png %}){:height="18px" width="18px"} icon, 
    but is locked and with a limited set of actions available.

    >**Note:** You can't declare a record if your permission level for the site is Consumer, or if the file is locked.

    A file that has been declared as a record can be deleted. The records remain in the File Plan.

This record can now be filed in the File Plan. You can find it in the *Unfiled Records* area in the File Plan explorer panel. 
New records display in the File Plan as incomplete records. You need to make sure any required metadata is added before 
you can set records to complete.

>**Note:** You can also set up folder rules in a non-Records Management site so the files can be automatically declared as records. For example, you could create a rule that when a file is tagged as "Confirmed", then a record will be created of that file and added to the Records Management site.
