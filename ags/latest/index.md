Alfresco Governance Services is fully compliant with a baseline of DoD 5015.02. With Alfresco Governance Services you can fully automate the record lifecycle from capture through retention to final destruction. Users can create records direct from any Alfresco Share site. On top of this security controls and classification give you complete control over who can see which records and when.

* [Alfresco Governance Services](TODO:../concepts/welcome-rm.md)  
Alfresco Governance Services controls important information that needs to be retained over time. It's used in highly regulated environments, for managing governmental information or personnel records, or where information might be audited.
* [Security Marks and Classification](TODO:../concepts/rm-security.md)  
You can add security controls to files, records, folders, and categories so that only users with the required security level can view or access them.
* [Governance Services Governance Services APIs](TODO:../concepts/gs-api-overview.md)  
Alfresco Governance Services provides two APIs, the GS Core API and the GS Security Marks API.
