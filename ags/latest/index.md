Alfresco Governance Services is fully compliant with a baseline of DoD 5015.02. With Alfresco Governance Services you can fully automate the record lifecycle from capture through retention to final destruction. Users can create records direct from any Alfresco Share site. On top of this security controls and classification give you complete control over who can see which records and when.
