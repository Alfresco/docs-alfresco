title: Introduction to using Governance Services
---

With Governance Services you store and control all your records in a dedicated site. 
A Governance Services site is like other Alfresco sites, but with additional controls placed on its content.

Access a Governance Services site just as you would any other Alfresco site, from the *My Sites* dashlet or the *Sites* menu.

Instead of storing your files in a document library as you do in a "regular" Alfresco site, in a Governance Services 
site you file your records in the *File Plan*. And you can't edit the content of records; once they're in the File Plan 
record content is considered to be final.

You file records by adding them from your computer to the File Plan, or if you're in another Alfresco site you can 
declare a file as a record and it will be added to the Governance Services site. Once files are added to the File Plan 
you can edit their metadata (properties) but you can't edit their actual content.

If you're new to Alfresco then take a look at [Using Alfresco](TODO_LINK:http://docs.alfresco.com/6.0/topics/sh-uh-welcome.html) to help you get started.

For more details on setting up and administering Governance Services see [Administering Records Management]({% link ags/latest/admin/index.md %}).

>**Note:** It's recommended that you use the File Plan for Governance Services actions rather than going through the repository.
