## Install overview

The SAP Connector is packaged as Alfresco Module Package (AMP) files. There are several stages to installing the SAP Connector: re-package the repository AMP, and then install the AMP files.

> **Note:** The SAP Connector uses the advantages of the SAP Java Connector for the communication between Content Services and the SAP system. According to the SAP terms & conditions, the redistribution of the native Java Connector libraries is no longer allowed. Hence, these libraries aren't included in the SAP Connector delivery package, and must be downloaded manually from the SAP Support Portal (requires an S-ID to log in). Once done, these libraries must be merged with the repository AMP file for the SAP Connector before starting the installation.

## Download files

Use the following steps to download the files required to install the SAP Connector.

1. Go to [Hyland Community](https://community.hyland.com/products/alfresco){:target="_blank"}, click **Product downloads**, and then download the SAP Connector distribution zip, which contains the following files:

    * `sap-content-connector-repo-5.3.x.amp` for Content Services.
    * `sap-content-connector-share-5.3.x.amp` for Alfresco Share.
    * `sap-content-connector-jco-packer-1.x.jar` - the **SAP JCo Packer tool** for merging the native SAP Java Connector libraries into the repository AMP file.
    * `sap-content-connector-encryptor-1.1.jar` to [encrypt plain-text passwords]({% link sap/5.3/admin/reference.md %}#encryptpwd) for all SAP Connector related properties in the `alfresco-global.properties` file.
    * `alfresco-global.properties_append` contains all required property keys to be added in the `alfresco-global.properties` for an SAP connection.

2. Log in to the [SAP Support Portal](https://support.sap.com/){:target="_blank"} with your SAP Universal ID:

    1. [Download](https://support.sap.com/en/product/connectors/jco.html){:target="_blank"} the native libraries for the SAP Java Connector based on your current system architecture.

        > **Important:** Ensure you download the correct SAP Java Connector version, which is related to the current system architecture of your Content Services server.

        ![]({% link sap/images/sap_packer_001.png %})

    2. Once all the required files have been downloaded, the next step is to copy the required SAP Java Connector libraries into the SAP Connector repository AMP file before starting the installation.

## Re-package the repository AMP

Use the SAP JCo Packer tool provided in the distribution zip to merge the native SAP Java Connector libraries into the SAP Connector repository AMP.

Before continuing, make sure you've [downloaded all the required files](#download-files).

The re-packaging is done by using the SAP JCo Packer tool (`sap-content-connector-jco-packer-1.x.jar`), which helps to create a merged AMP file that's used as the foundation for the installation.

> **Important**: You must have at least **Java Version 8** installed in order to run the distributed SAP JCo Packer tool.

1. Prepare the files for merge:

    1. Create a new temporary directory and copy the following files into it:

        * `sap-content-connector-jco-packer-1.x.jar`
        * `sap-content-connector-repo-5.3.x.amp`
        * `sapjco31P_3-20009381.zip` (example file name for native Java Connector libraries, downloaded from the SAP Support Portal)

            > **Note:** The ZIP name could be different, depending on your chosen system architecture.

        ![]({% link sap/images/sap_packer_002.png %})

    2. Verify the `sap-content-connector-repo-5.3.x.amp` file size. It should be less than 1 MB.

2. Run the merge tool:

    Starting from your temporary folder, run the SAP JCo Packer tool:

    ```java
    java -jar .\sap-content-connector-jco-packer-1.x.jar
    ```

    ![]({% link sap/images/sap_packer_003.png %})

    You'll see a few log statements to show what's happening, and the tool should finally return: **Processing finished...**

3. Verify the merge:

    Verify that the merge is successful and double-check the file size of the `sap-content-connector-repo-5.3.x.amp` again. This should now be much larger than before.

    > **Note:** Depending on the chosen system architecture of the SAP Java Connector, the repository AMP file may be up to 7 MB. This indicates that the required native SAP libraries are now available inside the AMP file.

    ![]({% link sap/images/sap_packer_004.png %})

4. Copy and save the re-packaged AMP file:

    The re-packaged `sap-content-connector-repo-5.3.x.amp` file should now be saved for the future. This is the final file that's needed to [install](#installsapconnamps) the SAP Connector.

    > **Note:** You only need to merge the native SAP Java Connector libraries once for a specific release of the SAP Connector.

5. Cleanup:

    Once the re-packaged AMP file is saved and stored outside the current temporary folder, you can safely delete the temporary folder.

## Install the SAP Connector {#installsapconnamps}

These steps describe how to install the SAP Connector to an instance of Content Services.

> **Note**: Ensure that you've followed the instructions to [repackage the repository AMP](#re-package-the-repository-amp) before installing the SAP Connector AMPs.

1. You need the following files to apply the SAP Connector:

    * `sap-content-connector-repo-5.3.x.amp` for Content Services

        > **Note**: This must be the re-packed file which includes the native SAP Java Connector libraries. Don't use the original file from the delivery package without the required changes.

    * `sap-content-connector-share-5.3.x.amp` for Alfresco Share

2. Use the Module Management Tool (MMT) to install the {% include tooltip.html word="AMP" text="AMP" %} files into the Repository WAR (`alfresco.war`) and the Share WAR (`share.war`).

    For more information, see [Using the Module Management Tool (MMT)]({% link content-services/latest/develop/extension-packaging.md %}#using-the-module-management-tool-mmt) and [Installing an Alfresco Module Package]({% link content-services/latest/install/zip/amp.md %}).

3. Add the related properties to the `alfresco-global.properties` file.

    See [Configure repository](#configrepo) for more information.

    You'll need to adapt the related property values to your configuration.

4. Check that the [configuration]({% link sap/5.3/config/index.md %}) is set up correctly for your environment.

5. Start Content Services.

## Configure repository {#configrepo}

These are the minimum required properties that must be appended to the `alfresco-global.properties` in order to establish the connection between Content Services (the Repository) and SAP.

> **Note:** There are additional properties that can be used to login to the SAP system via the SAP JavaConnector (such as using Logon Groups instead of the Gateway). See [Additional SAP JCo properties]({% link sap/5.3/admin/reference.md %}#sapjavaconprops) which lists the additional properties that are supported.

1. Open `alfresco-global.properties` in your Content Services installation.

2. Add all properties from the table below to the end of the file and set their values according to your environment.

3. Save the file.

    > **Note:** There are up to 100 possible SAP System Configurations. The table below shows the basic configuration for the first configuration. Therefore, the property contains the number **1** in the key.

    The letters **al** in some keys are the abbreviation for **A**rchive**l**ink. These settings are mandatory for the basic communication between SAP and Content Services.

## Install the license

The access and use of the SAP Connector is managed by a license. Any limitations are set when you purchased the license. To increase the limitations, contact Alfresco to obtain a new license. If you don't have a license yet, you can request a trial license.

> **Note:** Make sure you have a valid license file available before continuing. The name of the license file is `content-connector-for-sap.l4j`.

### Apply the license via the Alfresco Share user interface

1. Log in to Alfresco Share as an administrator.
2. Navigate to **Admin Tools** and click menu **SAP Integration**. This displays the SAP Connector Administration Console.

3. In the **License Information** section click **Choose Files**.
4. Select file `content-connector-for-sap.l4j`, and then click **Upload**.

    > **Note:** The new license is applied immediately- no restart of Content Services is required.

    ![sap_inst_001_license]({% link sap/images/sap_inst_001_license.png %})

An existing license file is backed up, renamed with the current time stamp, and remains on the file system (for example: `sapContentConnectorYYYY-mm-dd_hh:mm:ss.l4j`).

### Apply the license via the file system

1. Open the file `alfresco-global.properties` and search for the key `dir.license.external`. Note this value as you'll need it next.
2. Navigate to the folder provided in the property value.
3. Copy the license file `content-connector-for-sap.l4j` into that folder.
4. Restart the Content Services application server.

## Set up in a cluster

To set up the SAP Connector in clustered landscapes for high availability:

1. Install the `sap-content-connector-repo-5.x.amp` for Content Services on each node in the cluster.

    >  **Important:** Make sure you only use the merged SAP Connector repository AMP file, which includes the native SAP libraries, as described in [Installing overview]({% link sap/5.3/install/index.md %}).

2. Install the `sap-content-connector-share-5.x.amp` for Alfresco Share on each node in the cluster.
3. Update the `alfresco-global.properties` with the SAP related properties.
4. On the SAP side, for each SAP Content Repository (transaction `OAC0`), the HTTP-Server must point to the load balancer instead of a dedicated application server instance. See the Content Services documentation for [high availability]({% link content-services/latest/admin/cluster.md %}#scenariohighthrucluster).
