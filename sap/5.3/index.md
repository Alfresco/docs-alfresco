title: Alfresco Content Connector for SAP Applications
---

The Alfresco Content Connector for SAP applications is an add-on module that offers seamless integration between Alfresco Content Services and SAP (R/3, S/4HANA). It connects the structured data in SAP with the unstructured data (or "living content") in Alfresco.

Here is a summary of the key capabilities:

* **Improved Productivity:** One single source of truth for content via different user interfaces improves productivity.
* **Collaboration Ready:** Make content available in the business process for different teams inside or outside the company.
* **Metadata Synchronization:** Leverage structured data also outside SAP with automated metadata synchronization.
* **Certified by SAP:** All SAP HTTP-Content Server related standard scenarios are covered. For example:
  * SAP Archivelink
    * Incoming documents (e.g. incoming invoices)
      * Early Archiving with SAP Workflow
      * Early Archiving with Barcode
      * Late Archiving
    * Outgoing documents (e.g. order confirmations)
    * Print List Archiving (e.g. quarter end reports)
    * SAP Workflow
* SAP Document Management Service (DMS)
* SAP Attachments
* SAP Data Archiving (ADK)

> **Important:** The SAP Connector module can be applied to Alfresco Content Services. See [Prerequisites]({% link sap/latest/install/index.md %}#prerequisites) and [Supported platforms]({% link sap/latest/support/index.md %}) for more.
