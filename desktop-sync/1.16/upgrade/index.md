title: Upgrade Desktop Sync
---

You'll be notified when a newer version of Desktop Sync is provided by your IT team. 
This is shown as a notification in the system tray (Windows) or in the menu bar (Mac).

When a new version of Desktop Sync is available to install, a warning icon is displayed.

1. Click the notification or select one of the following options:

    * (Windows) Right-click the system tray icon and select **Update client**.
    * (Mac) Click the menu bar icon and select **Update client**.
    
    The new installer is downloaded to your local **Downloads** folder.

2. Once the download completes, then the installer starts automatically.

3. Follow the steps in [Installing Desktop Sync]({% link desktop-sync/1.16/install/index.md %}) to complete the installation.

    >**Note:**
    >
    >* If the download fails, then a notification is shown. Re-try the installer download to continue.
    >* If you choose to defer the update, or the install doesn't complete, then the notification is repeated daily, and each time that the app is restarted.
