### Uninstalling Desktop Sync on Mac

Before uninstalling Desktop Sync for Mac you should first remove your account then drag the application to the Trash. You can then perform a number of checks to verify that the content has been removed cleanly.

1. Click ![alfresco]({% link desktop-sync/images/ico-ds-alfresco.png %}){:height="18px" width="18px"} then ![settings]({% link desktop-sync/images/ds-ico-settings.png %}){:height="18px" width="18px"} to access **Settings**, and select **Remove Account**.

    This removes the content subscriptions, device registration, keychain, databases, etc.

2. Click Quit to shutdown Desktop Sync.

3. Drag the Desktop Sync application from the `Applications` folder to the Trash.

    This ensures that the application is removed cleanly.

4. In Finder, click on the **Go** menu and select **Go to Folder...**.

    A text field appears.

5. Paste the path `~/Library/Application Support` into the text field and click **Go**.

6. Delete the `Alfresco` folder.

    This removes the sync logs, database files, and configuration files.

7. Open `/<userHome>` and delete the `Alfresco` folder.

    This removes any remaining synced content, such as orphaned files, i.e. any content that was in conflict when you removed your account.

    > **Note:** You don't need to uninstall the Desktop Sync client before installing a new version. Simply run the new installer to update the application.
