Hover your cursor over the Desktop Sync icon to display sync status information, such as date and time of last sync, sync issues (conflicts), and any pending updates.

![]({% link desktop-sync/images/ds-system-msg.png %}){:height="76px" width="184px"}

Right-click on the Desktop Sync icon ![]({% link desktop-sync/images/ds-icon.png %}) to see the application popup menu:

![]({% link desktop-sync/images/ds-system-menu-1.14.png %}){:height="178px" width="184px"}

### Application menu items

The following section goes through each one of the Desktop Sync menu items.

#### Open

Displays information about checked out files, any pending syncs, and conflicts.

![]({% link desktop-sync/images/conflict.png %}){:height="374px" width="756px"}

* Select **Files Checked Out** to view information about any files you've checked out fromÂ Desktop Sync, for example, file name, file location, and details when the file was downloaded.
* Select **Pending Syncs** to view information about any pending syncs, for example, file name, status of the pending sync, modifier, file location, and details when the file was last accessed.
* Select **Conflicts** to view conflict-related information and resolve the conflict. The information displayed includes file name, the conflict or issue, modifier, location of the conflict, and details when the file was last modified.
* Select the file in conflict and click **Resolve**.

To resolve a conflict, choose which version to keep, Alfresco or your changes and click **Keep**:

![]({% link desktop-sync/images/conflict-resolution.png %}){:height="246px" width="350px"}

* **Alfresco Version**: Replaces the local file with the Alfresco copy.
* **My Version**: Copies updates made to content locally to Alfresco.

##### Working with multiple Checked Out files

If several files are **Checked Out**, you have the following options:

* Select files individually using the check boxes to the left hand side, or use the select all files check box at the top.
* When you select more than one check box, you can pick bulk actions at the top of the tab, **Check In** and **Cancel Check Out**. If you choose **Check In**, you can select if the new version is a major or minor change, and optionally input a comment. Select **Check In** again to save your changes. This applies the same version change and comment (if added) to all the selected files.

#### Go to Alfresco Folder

Opens the `Alfresco` sync folder for Desktop Sync.

#### Search

Opens the **Search** dialog so you can search your local synced files and folders.

You can only search the content that's already synced in the `Alfresco` folder. This avoids having to use the search feature in Mac Finder/Windows Explorer which takes longer and sometimes provides irrelevant results.

* Start your search by typing in the search field. You'll see results presented even if you've only provided partial search text. In the search results, you'll see files and folders are easily identifiable by their respective icons.
* You can view the search results listed by *Name*, *Location*, *Modified Date*, and *Size*. You can also search by file name and file extension, for example, by entering `png` or `.png`.
* To locate a file from the **Search** dialog, double-click the file/folder icon to show the content in Windows Explorer.

#### Recent Files

Click **Recent Files** to open the Recent Files dialog and view your recently used files in the `Alfresco` sync folder.

* The recently used files are listed by *Name*, *Location*, *Modified Date*, and *Size*, where the most recently updated file is at the top.
* To locate a file from the **Recent Files** dialog, double-click the required file to show the content in Windows Explorer.

#### Sync Now

By default local content is synced to Alfresco immediately and Alfresco content is synced locally every five minutes. Click this if you want content synced immediately.

#### Pause Sync

Pauses Sync if you don't wish to synchronize files from the server, for example when you have a low bandwidth connection.

#### Manage Your Account

You can manage which folders and sites get synced on your desktop and other account details using **Manage Your Account**. The available options are:

* **Manage Folders**: Opens Choose folders and sites to sync screen. See [Select content to sync]({% link desktop-sync/1.16/using/select-to-sync.md %}#sync/windows).

    If you deselect a previously synced folder and click **Sync**, then the synced content from your desktop is removed. In case you have any unsynced or conflicted files, they will be orphaned in `C:\Users\<username>\Alfresco\`orphaned.

* **Consistency Check**: Performs a consistency check on Desktop Sync. This is typically used in collaboration with your IT team when you need support.

* **Account Information**: View the account information for Desktop Sync:

    * **User Name** for the currently logged in user.
    * **Storage Used** by the `Alfresco` sync folder on your hard drive.

* **Enter Your New Password**: If you have recently changed your Alfresco password, use this option to update the same password in Desktop Sync.

    The **Have you recently changed your password in Alfresco?** window appears. Specify the updated password to resume syncing and click **Update**.

* **Remove Local Content**: Removes all the synced content from Desktop Sync without the need to remove the user account. This provides support for a customer policy where content is only kept on a device when users are actively working on that content and using Desktop Sync.

    To start using Desktop Sync again, you'll need to set up your synced files via the **Manage Your Account > Manage Folders** menu option. See [Select content to sync]({% link desktop-sync/1.16/using/select-to-sync.md %}#sync/windows).
