title: Alfresco Desktop Sync
---

With Desktop Sync, desktop users can securely and automatically sync content between their desktop and Alfresco Content Services.

You can easily connect to Alfresco Content Services and select folders and sites to view and work with on the desktop, 
even when working offline.

Once the folders and sites are selected, they are automatically downloaded and visible using Microsoft File Explorer (for Windows) 
or Finder (for Mac).

Changes are automatically synced from Alfresco Content Services to the desktop, so the latest content is always available. 
This allows you to work in places where you don't have internet access, secure in the knowledge that your changes will show up 
in Alfresco Content Services once you're back online.

For information about installing and configuring the Desktop Sync service server side AMP, 
see [Installing and configuring Sync Service](TODO_LINK:https://docs.alfresco.com/syncservice/concepts/desktopsync-admin.html).
