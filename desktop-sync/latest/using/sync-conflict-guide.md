title: Resolve and manage sync conflicts 
---

Use the following information to resolve and manage Desktop Sync conflicts.

Whilst Desktop Sync ensures that content is kept up to date silently, under normal operation there may be circumstances where Desktop Sync can't resolve differences between a file stored on your desktop and the corresponding file in Alfresco.

When the sync changes can't be updated automatically you are asked to resolve the conflict manually. This happens when a file has changed in both locations since its last sync, making it difficult to determine which changes to save.

For example, a conflict occurs when you update a file in your `Alfresco` sync folder and an update to the same file has happened on the server since the last sync. Desktop Sync will give you a choice of resolving the sync conflict by either choosing to keep your changes, or discarding your changes in favor of the latest copy from Alfresco.

{% capture windows %}

A conflict may either be resolved automatically by Desktop Sync or may require you to do something.
